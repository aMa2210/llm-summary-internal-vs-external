A Doll_s House-Henrik Ibsen,"Nora Helmer, in high spirits on Christmas Eve, returns home with parcels, secretly eating macaroons. Her husband, Torvald Helmer, greets her with affectionate but condescending pet names like ""little lark,"" ""little squirrel,"" and ""little spendthrift."" He playfully chastises her for spending too much money but then gives her some for Christmas. He firmly expresses his belief that a home should never rely on debt, as it destroys freedom and beauty. Nora hides one of her purchases from him and attempts to subtly ask him for money for herself, which he dismisses, reiterating his view of her as wasteful.

Doctor Rank, a family friend, arrives and goes into Torvald's study. Shortly after, Mrs. Christine Linde, an old school friend of Nora's, arrives. Nora is delighted but shocked by Christine's changed appearance. Christine reveals she is a widow, has lost her mother and her two younger brothers are now self-sufficient, leaving her feeling ""unspeakably empty"" and in search of work. Nora excitedly shares that Torvald has just been appointed manager of the Bank, ensuring them a large salary and financial security.

Wishing to help Christine, Nora boasts that she can use her influence with Torvald to get Christine a position at the bank. Mrs. Linde, believing Nora to be naive about life's hardships, prompts Nora to reveal a long-held secret: it was Nora, not her father, who secretly borrowed 250 pounds years ago to finance Torvald's life-saving trip to Italy when he was gravely ill. She forged her dying father's signature on the bond to protect him and to avoid burdening Torvald, who despises debt. Nora describes how she has been secretly working odd jobs, like copying, to pay off the debt and its quarterly interest, feeling proud of her efforts ""like being a man.""

Suddenly, Krogstad, a lawyer, arrives and asks to speak to Torvald on bank business. Mrs. Linde reacts with visible distress upon seeing him. Doctor Rank later identifies Krogstad as a man with a ""diseased moral character"" who is currently with Helmer, also on bank matters.

Krogstad, who knows Nora's secret, confronts her. He reveals that Torvald plans to dismiss him from his subordinate position at the bank and give it to Mrs. Linde. Krogstad demands that Nora use her influence to ensure he keeps his post and receives a promotion. He threatens to expose her forgery of her father's signature on the bond if she fails to help him. He reveals the date on the bond (October 2nd) is three days after her father's death (September 29th) and that the date, as well as the signature itself, is not her father's handwriting, but one Krogstad believes he recognizes. Nora defiantly admits to forging her father's name, explaining she did it out of love to save Torvald's life and couldn't bear to tell her dying father about her husband's grave condition. Krogstad reminds her that the law cares nothing for motives and warns her that if he loses his position, she will lose hers with him.

After Krogstad leaves, Nora is deeply disturbed by his threats, especially Helmer's earlier pronouncements about deceitful parents corrupting their children. She tells her children not to mention the ""stranger man"" to their father and isolates herself from them.

Helmer returns and immediately suspects Krogstad has been trying to influence Nora. He chastises Nora for lying about Krogstad's visit and for attempting to intercede on behalf of a ""morally diseased"" man like Krogstad, who he claims ""poisoned his own children with lies and dissimulation."" Helmer emphatically states he cannot work with such a person and has already dispatched a letter of dismissal. Nora begs him to recall the letter for their sake and the children's, but it's too late. Helmer, unaware of the forgery, dismisses her fears as ""childish nervousness"" and promises to shield her from any consequences, asserting his strength as a man.

The next day, Christmas Day, Nora is anxious and agitated, continually checking the letterbox for Krogstad's response. She asks the Nurse if children forget their mothers if they go away, and the Nurse shares that she herself had to put her own child out to strangers to be Nora's nurse. Mrs. Linde arrives to help Nora mend her costume for the upcoming fancy-dress ball. Nora reveals Doctor Rank's terminal illness, which he inherited from his morally corrupt father. Mrs. Linde, suspecting Rank lent Nora the money, prompts Nora to vehemently deny it, though Nora admits she needs to ""make an end of it"" with the ""other one"" (Krogstad).

Helmer returns, and Nora, desperate to prevent him from checking the letterbox, insists he must devote himself entirely to helping her rehearse her Tarantella dance for the ball, forbidding him from touching any letters until after the event.

Doctor Rank arrives and, in a poignant conversation, reveals to Nora that he is dying from an inherited spinal disease and will soon send her a card with a black cross as his farewell. He expresses his disdain for ""ugliness"" and says he will ""bar his door"" to Helmer when he dies. During this conversation, he confesses his deep love for Nora, which she gently rebuffs.

Krogstad then enters through the back stairs, having received his dismissal letter. He informs Nora that he will keep the forged bond and demand a higher position at the bank, making him Helmer's ""right hand."" He dismisses Nora's desperate ideas of escape or suicide, assuring her that he would still have power over Helmer. Krogstad then drops a letter detailing Nora's forgery into Helmer's locked letterbox. Nora is horrified.

Mrs. Linde returns and Nora confesses the full extent of her forgery. Nora, in a state of terror, speaks of a ""wonderful thing"" that is about to happen, asking Christine to be her witness if she goes mad or disappears, affirming that she alone is responsible. Mrs. Linde, upon seeing Krogstad's card, realizes she knows him and rushes out to speak with him, hoping to retrieve the letter.

Nora again distracts Helmer by continuing to practice her Tarantella with him, urging him not to open any letters. Mrs. Linde returns, having failed to retrieve the letter from Krogstad, but informs Nora that Krogstad will return tomorrow. She tells Nora that the truth must come out for a genuine understanding between Nora and Helmer, believing that ""concealment and falsehood"" make a true relationship impossible. Nora, now counting the hours until the ball ends and Helmer discovers the truth, expresses a strange mixture of dread and anticipation for the ""wonderful thing"" she believes might happen.

Later that night, after the ball, Mrs. Linde is waiting at the Helmers' house. Krogstad arrives, and they reconcile. Christine explains she left him years ago to support her family, but now she is alone and wants to ""join forces"" with him, offering herself as a mother to his children and a partner to him. Krogstad is overwhelmed with happiness and agrees, now wanting to redeem himself. He offers to retrieve his letter from Helmer's box, but Mrs. Linde insists he should not. She believes the truth must be revealed so that Nora and Helmer can confront their relationship honestly. Krogstad agrees, saying he will wait for her downstairs.

Helmer brings a resistant Nora home from the ball, praising her dancing but also her ""capricious"" nature. He expresses a possessive, romantic desire for her. Doctor Rank makes a final appearance, revealing his imminent death with a metaphor about becoming ""invisible"" at the next ball and asking for a last cigar. Nora lights it for him, and he bids them farewell.

After Rank leaves, Helmer goes to empty the letterbox and finds Krogstad's letter, along with Rank's cards marked with black crosses, signaling his impending death. He reads Krogstad's letter and is enraged, calling Nora a ""hypocrite, a liar—worse, worse—a criminal!"" He blames her father for her moral failings and laments that she has destroyed his happiness and ruined his future by placing him in Krogstad's power. He declares that their intimate relationship is over, though they must maintain appearances for society. He forbids her from raising the children, stating he cannot trust her with them.

At that moment, a second letter from Krogstad arrives. Helmer reads it and shouts with joy: Krogstad has sent back the forged bond and both letters, expressing regret and repentance due to ""a happy change in his life."" Helmer is relieved, tears up the incriminating papers, and throws them into the stove. He then ""forgives"" Nora for her actions, attributing them to her love and ""womanly helplessness,"" and promises to protect and guide her, treating her now as ""both wife and child.""

Nora, however, has changed into her everyday dress. She sits Helmer down for a serious conversation, stating this is their first real discussion in eight years of marriage. She reveals she has never been happy, only ""merry,"" and that both her father and Helmer have treated her like a ""doll,"" playing with her according to their whims. She declares she must leave to educate herself and understand the world, as she is no longer fit to be his wife or a mother to their children.

Helmer protests, citing her ""sacred duties"" as a wife and mother and worrying about public opinion. Nora asserts she has ""other duties just as sacred""—duties to herself. She no longer believes she is primarily a wife and mother but a ""reasonable human being"" who must learn to think for herself. She questions the justice of society's laws, which she finds foolish for punishing actions taken out of love.

Helmer accuses her of not loving him anymore. Nora confirms this, stating she realized it tonight when the ""wonderful thing"" she had hoped for did not happen. She had expected him to bravely take all the blame and sacrifice his honor for her, but instead, he prioritized his own reputation. She concludes that he is not the man she could truly bind herself to.

Nora returns her wedding ring to Helmer and takes back her own. She says she will not see the children, believing they are better off without her in her current state. She states that the ""most wonderful thing of all"" would be if they both changed so much that their life together could become a ""real wedlock,"" but she no longer believes in such wonders. Nora exits through the hall, shutting the door behind her, leaving Helmer alone and despairing in the empty house."
Alice_s Adventures in Wonderland-Lewis Carroll,"Here is a very detailed plot summary of the provided text, ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"":

The story begins with **Alice** sitting idly by her sister on a riverbank, feeling bored and sleepy. Her sister is reading a book without pictures or conversations, which Alice finds useless. While pondering whether to make a daisy-chain, Alice suddenly sees a **White Rabbit** with pink eyes run by. What makes this remarkable is that the Rabbit takes a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, looks at it, and exclaims, ""Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!"" Driven by curiosity, Alice runs after it across the field and sees it disappear down a large rabbit-hole under a hedge.

Without a moment's hesitation, Alice follows the Rabbit down the hole. The rabbit-hole goes straight like a tunnel before suddenly dipping downwards, sending Alice into a long, slow fall down a very deep well. As she falls, she observes the sides of the well, noticing cupboards, book-shelves, maps, and pictures. She takes down a jar labeled ""ORANGE MARMALADE,"" but it is empty. Not wanting to drop it, she carefully places it in a cupboard. During her descent, Alice calculates how far she's fallen, wonders if she'll fall through the earth, and talks to herself about her cat, Dinah, and whether cats eat bats, becoming drowsy.

Her fall ends with a thump onto a heap of sticks and dry leaves, leaving her unhurt. She quickly jumps up and sees the White Rabbit still ahead, hurrying down a long passage and exclaiming, ""Oh my ears and whiskers, how late it’s getting!"" Alice chases after it, but when she turns a corner, the Rabbit is gone. She finds herself in a long, low hall lit by lamps, with numerous locked doors. After trying all the doors, she discovers a small three-legged glass table with a tiny golden key. This key is too small for the large doors, but Alice then finds a low curtain, behind which is a small door about fifteen inches high. To her delight, the golden key fits this lock.

Opening the small door, Alice sees a beautiful garden but cannot fit through the tiny passage. She wishes she could shrink. Returning to the table, she finds a bottle labeled ""DRINK ME."" After prudently checking that it's not marked ""poison,"" she tastes the liquid, which has a delightful mixed flavor. She drinks it all and instantly shrinks to ten inches high. Excited, she realizes she's now the right size for the garden door, but then remembers she left the golden key on the table, which she can no longer reach. She tries to climb the slippery table leg in vain and sits down to cry.

Soon, Alice spots a small glass box under the table, containing a tiny cake marked ""EAT ME"" in currants. She decides to eat it, reasoning that if she grows larger, she can reach the key, and if smaller, she can creep under the door. She eats a bit but remains the same size, which she finds ""dull."" She finishes the cake.

Instead of shrinking, Alice begins to grow enormously, exclaiming ""Curiouser and curiouser!"" Her feet become almost out of sight, and her head hits the ceiling, making her over nine feet tall. She manages to take the golden key and hurry to the garden door, but can only lie down and look into the garden with one eye. Overwhelmed, she begins to cry again, shedding so many tears that a large pool forms around her, four inches deep and reaching halfway down the hall.

She then hears the White Rabbit returning, now splendidly dressed and carrying white kid gloves and a fan. He mutters about the ""Duchess"" and being late. Alice timidly asks him for help, startling the Rabbit, who drops his gloves and fan and scurries away. Alice picks up the items and fans herself, feeling hot. She questions her identity, tries to recite lessons incorrectly, and concludes she must have been changed. She notices she's put on one of the Rabbit's gloves and is shrinking rapidly. She realizes the fan is the cause and drops it just in time, preventing her from shrinking out of existence. Now about two feet high, she finds the garden door shut and the key still on the unreachable table, feeling worse than ever.

Her foot slips, and she falls into the pool of tears she created, now up to her chin in salt water. She swims, wishing she hadn't cried so much, and encounters a **Mouse**. She tries to converse with it, first in English, then in French (""Où est ma chatte?""), which frightens the Mouse. Alice apologizes, realizing the Mouse dislikes cats. She tries to soothe it by talking about her pet cat Dinah, inadvertently praising Dinah's mouse-catching skills, which further offends the Mouse. She apologizes again and promises not to mention cats or dogs. The Mouse agrees to tell her its history if they reach the shore. The pool is now crowded with other creatures, including a **Duck**, a **Dodo**, a **Lory**, and an **Eaglet**. Alice leads them all to the bank.

On the bank, the wet, bedraggled group discusses how to get dry. The Mouse, assuming authority, begins to recite a dull historical text about William the Conqueror. The other animals interrupt with complaints. Alice, still wet, suggests the story isn't helping. The Dodo then proposes a ""Caucus-race"" as the most energetic remedy. It marks a circular course, and everyone runs when they like and stops when they like. After about half an hour, when they are all dry, the Dodo declares the race over and states, ""Everybody has won, and all must have prizes."" The Dodo appoints Alice to give out prizes. Alice finds a box of comfits in her pocket and distributes one to each creature. For her own prize, the Dodo takes a thimble from Alice's pocket and solemnly presents it back to her.

After eating the comfits, the group asks the Mouse to tell its promised history, specifically why it hates ""C and D"" (cats and dogs). The Mouse begins a ""long and sad tale,"" but Alice, distracted by the text's tail-like shape on the page, keeps interrupting, misunderstanding the Mouse's words. The Mouse becomes very angry and walks away. Alice tries to call it back, and the other animals join in, but the Mouse refuses. Alice then mentions her cat Dinah, praising her hunting abilities, which causes all the birds to flee in alarm, leaving Alice alone and feeling lonely. She then hears footsteps, hoping it's the Mouse returning.

It is the White Rabbit, returning and frantically searching for his lost gloves and fan, muttering about the Duchess. Alice realizes he's looking for the items she picked up, but the great hall has vanished. The Rabbit mistakes Alice for his housemaid, **Mary Ann**, and imperiously orders her to run home and fetch a new pair of gloves and a fan. Frightened, Alice obeys and finds the Rabbit's house, marked ""W. RABBIT."" Inside, she finds a fan and some tiny white kid gloves. She then spots a bottle, drinks from it, hoping to grow larger again, and rapidly expands until she is stuck in the room, her elbow pressed against the door, and one foot up the chimney.

The Rabbit arrives, demanding Mary Ann open the door, but Alice's elbow blocks it. He decides to enter through the window. Alice, stretching out her hand, causes a shriek and broken glass, making her think the Rabbit fell into a cucumber-frame. She then hears the Rabbit angrily calling for ""Pat"" and another voice confirming his presence, digging for apples. Pat identifies Alice's arm filling the window. Alice again stretches her hand out, causing more shrieks and broken glass. She then hears voices planning to use ladders to get ""Bill"" down the chimney. Alice realizes Bill is a small animal. When Bill scratches in the chimney, Alice gives a sharp kick with her foot. She hears a chorus of ""There goes Bill!"" and then Bill's feeble squeaking voice describing being launched like a ""Jack-in-the-box."" The Rabbit suggests burning the house down, but Alice threatens to set her cat Dinah on them, causing silence. Pebbles then shower through the window, turning into little cakes on the floor. Alice eats one, hoping to shrink, and does so immediately.

Once small enough, Alice runs out of the house. Outside, she sees a crowd of animals and birds, with **Bill the Lizard** (the one from the chimney) being revived with a bottle by two guinea-pigs. The crowd rushes at Alice, but she flees into a thick wood. Her goals are to grow back to her normal size and find the beautiful garden. She encounters an enormous **Puppy**, which frightens her. She distracts it with a stick and eventually escapes. Resting, she remembers she still needs to grow and wonders what to eat. She finds a large mushroom and, peeping over its edge, sees a large blue **Caterpillar** sitting on top, smoking a hookah.

The Caterpillar asks Alice, ""Who are _you?_"" Alice explains she hardly knows anymore due to her frequent size changes. The Caterpillar is unimpressed by her confusion. It asks her to recite ""'_You are old, Father William_,'"" but Alice's recitation is nonsensical and altered. The Caterpillar declares it ""wrong from beginning to end."" When asked what size she wants to be, Alice says she'd like to be a little larger than three inches, finding that height ""wretched."" The Caterpillar, which is exactly three inches high, takes offense. Before crawling away, it tells Alice that ""One side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you grow shorter""—referring to the mushroom.

Alice breaks off a piece of the mushroom from each side. Nibbling one piece, she shrinks rapidly until her chin touches her foot. She quickly eats from the other piece, and her head is freed, but her neck grows immensely long, like a serpent's, extending above a ""sea of green leaves"" (which turn out to be treetops). A large **Pigeon** flies into her face, screaming ""Serpent!"" The Pigeon explains its struggles to protect its eggs from serpents and mistakes Alice's long neck for one. Alice tries to explain she is a ""little girl,"" but the Pigeon finds this unbelievable. Alice denies looking for eggs or liking them raw. The sulky Pigeon returns to its nest. Alice, remembering the mushroom pieces, carefully nibbles from each until she is back to her normal height. She then sees a little house and, realizing she's too large, eats some mushroom to shrink to nine inches high before approaching.

Alice arrives at the Duchess's house. She sees a **Fish-Footman** deliver a croquet invitation from the Queen to a **Frog-Footman**. Alice finds their formal, repetitive exchange amusing. After the Fish-Footman departs, Alice tries to enter. The Frog-Footman, speaking nonsensically, explains that knocking is useless due to the noise inside and his position on the same side of the door. A plate then flies out of the house, narrowly missing the Footman's head. Frustrated, Alice opens the door and enters a smoke-filled kitchen. The **Duchess** is nursing a constantly sneezing and howling baby, while the **Cook** stirs a peppery soup and throws kitchenware at them. A **Cheshire Cat** sits grinning by the fire.

Alice asks the Duchess why her cat grins, learning it's a ""Cheshire cat."" The Cook resumes throwing things, narrowly missing the baby's nose. The Duchess offers Alice convoluted ""morals"" for everything. Alice tries to share her knowledge of the earth's rotation, but the Duchess interrupts with ""chop off her head!"" The Duchess then sings a violent lullaby to the baby, shaking it, and then flings the squirming baby at Alice, telling her to nurse it while she goes to play croquet with the Queen. Alice, struggling to hold the baby, takes it outside. She notices its pig-like features and realizes it has completely transformed into a pig. She sets it down, and it trots away into the wood.

Alice then sees the Cheshire Cat again, sitting on a tree bough. She asks it for directions. The Cat explains that where she goes depends on where she wants to get to. It then informs her that everyone here is mad, including the **Hatter** and the **March Hare**, and even Alice herself, simply for being there. The Cat explains its own madness by noting it growls when pleased and wags its tail when angry. The Cat vanishes and reappears several times, confirming the baby turned into a pig. Its final disappearance leaves only its grin floating in the air for a moment, which Alice finds ""the most curious thing."" Alice then heads towards the March Hare's house, shrinking herself before approaching.

At the March Hare's house, Alice finds the **March Hare** and the **Hatter** having a perpetual tea-party under a tree, using a sleeping **Dormouse** as a cushion. They rudely tell her there's no room, but Alice sits down. The March Hare offers non-existent wine, and the Hatter makes personal remarks about her hair. The Hatter then poses a riddle, ""Why is a raven like a writing-desk?"", which no one, including himself or the March Hare, knows the answer to. They engage in a nonsensical discussion about language and time. The Hatter explains that he and ""Time"" (personified) had a quarrel after he sang at the Queen of Hearts' concert, resulting in it always being six o'clock (tea-time) for them. They continually move around the table as dishes get used.

When asked to tell a story, Alice declines, so the Dormouse is pinched awake to tell one. The Dormouse begins a story about three little sisters who lived in a ""treacle-well"" and learned to draw ""treacle."" Alice's questions about this puzzling tale lead to more arguments and interruptions from the Hatter and March Hare. The Hatter calls for a clean cup, and they all shift places, leaving Alice worse off. The Dormouse eventually drifts back to sleep, listing things that begin with ""M."" Alice, disgusted by their rudeness and the nonsensical conversation, walks away, vowing never to return. She then notices a door in a tree, enters it, and finds herself back in the long hall. Taking the golden key, she uses her remaining mushroom piece to shrink to a foot high and finally enters the beautiful garden.

In the garden, Alice sees three card-shaped gardeners (Two, Five, and Seven) busily painting white roses red. She overhears them explaining they planted the wrong color rose and will be beheaded by the Queen if discovered. Suddenly, ""The Queen! The Queen!"" is announced, and the gardeners flatten themselves on their faces. A grand procession arrives: soldiers, courtiers, royal children, and guests (including the White Rabbit and the **Knave of Hearts**), followed by the **King and Queen of Hearts**. Alice remains standing. The Queen sternly asks her name and then demands to know who the prostrate gardeners are. Alice, surprisingly bold, says she doesn't know. The furious Queen screams, ""Off with her head!"" but Alice loudly replies, ""Nonsense!"" silencing the Queen.

The King timidly intervenes, calling Alice ""only a child."" The Queen orders the Knave to turn the gardeners over. She then demands to know what they've been doing and, upon hearing their explanation, again shouts, ""Off with their heads!"" Alice quickly hides the gardeners in a large flower-pot, and the soldiers sent to execute them cannot find them. The Queen then asks Alice if she can play croquet.

The croquet game is chaotic: the ground is ridged, the balls are live hedgehogs, the mallets are live flamingoes, and the arches are doubled-up soldiers who constantly walk away. Alice struggles to control her flamingo. The Queen frequently screams ""Off with his head!"" or ""Off with her head!"" at other players. Alice, feeling uneasy, then sees the grinning **Cheshire Cat**'s head appear in the air. She complains to it about the unfair game. The King approaches, curious about the Cat's head, and Alice introduces it. The King, disliking its look, orders its removal. The Queen decrees, ""Off with his head!"" and the King goes to fetch the executioner.

Alice finds her hedgehog gone and retrieves her flamingo. She returns to find the King, Queen, and executioner arguing about how to behead a head without a body (as only the Cat's head is visible). Alice suggests they ask the Duchess, who is in prison. The Queen sends the executioner to fetch the Duchess. As the executioner leaves, the Cat's head begins to fade and completely disappears by the time the executioner returns with the Duchess. The King and executioner frantically search for the vanished head while the others return to the game.

The **Duchess** affectionately links arms with Alice, now in a much pleasanter mood, attributing her earlier savagery to pepper. She continues to share morals on various topics. Alice finds her chin uncomfortable. The Queen then reappears, furious at seeing the Duchess, and threatens her with execution. The Duchess vanishes instantly. The Queen returns to the game, ordering more executions. Eventually, all players except the King, Queen, and Alice are in custody. The Queen, out of breath, asks Alice if she's seen the **Mock Turtle**. Alice says no, so the Queen sends her with a **Gryphon** (found sleeping) to hear the Mock Turtle's history. As they leave, Alice hears the King pardon all the imprisoned players.

The Gryphon reveals that the Queen never actually executes anyone; it's ""all her fancy."" They find the **Mock Turtle** sitting sadly on a rock, sighing. The Gryphon again says the Mock Turtle's sorrow is ""all his fancy."" The Mock Turtle, in a deep, hollow tone, agrees to tell his history. He begins by saying he was ""a real Turtle."" Alice's interruption about him being called ""Tortoise"" (because he taught them) irritates him. He describes his sea-school education, including ""Reeling and Writhing"" and ""Arithmetic—Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, and Derision."" Alice is unfamiliar with ""Uglification."" He also learned ""Mystery, ancient and modern, with Seaography,"" and ""Drawling, Stretching, and Fainting in Coils"" from a conger-eel. The Gryphon adds that he went to a ""Classics master,"" an old crab who taught ""Laughing and Grief."" The Mock Turtle explains that lessons ""lessen from day to day"" (ten hours the first, nine the next, etc.).

The Gryphon cuts off the lesson discussion, telling the Mock Turtle to talk about games. The Mock Turtle, after deep sobs, describes the ""Lobster Quadrille"" dance, involving lobsters as partners, throwing them out to sea, and turning somersaults. He and the Gryphon demonstrate the dance around Alice while the Mock Turtle sings ""Will you walk a little faster?"" a song about a whiting and a snail. Alice enjoys the song. The Mock Turtle explains that whitings have their tails in their mouths because they were thrown far out to sea. The Gryphon adds that whitings ""do the boots and shoes"" under the sea, which are made of ""Soles and eels."" Alice then begins to tell her own adventures, starting from seeing the White Rabbit. When she recounts her incorrect recitation of ""Father William"" to the Caterpillar, the Mock Turtle and Gryphon find it very curious. The Gryphon makes her recite ""'_’Tis the voice of the sluggard_',"" but Alice's version is again nonsensical, about a lobster. She then tries another verse, ""I passed by his garden..."" but the Mock Turtle interrupts, demanding an explanation. The Gryphon tells Alice to stop. The Gryphon then asks if they want another dance figure or a song from the Mock Turtle. Alice eagerly chooses a song. The Mock Turtle, sobbing, sings ""Beautiful Soup."" As he begins to repeat the chorus, a cry of ""The trial’s beginning!"" is heard in the distance. The Gryphon grabs Alice's hand and hurries her off to the trial.

Alice and the Gryphon arrive at the court, finding the King and Queen of Hearts on their throne, surrounded by various creatures and cards. The Knave of Hearts is in chains, accused of stealing tarts. The White Rabbit is the Herald. Alice notes the King is the judge (wearing his crown over a wig), and twelve creatures are the jurymen, busily writing on slates (writing their names, then ""stupid things!"" when Alice says it). Alice removes Bill the Lizard's squeaking pencil. The White Rabbit reads the accusation: ""The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts... The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts...""

The first witness is the **Hatter**, who arrives with a teacup and bread-and-butter. He gives confused testimony about when he started tea and ""twinkling"" things, contradicting the March Hare and Dormouse. Alice begins to grow larger again, making the Dormouse complain. The King, growing impatient and threatening execution, demands clear evidence. The Hatter's testimony remains nonsensical. A guinea-pig cheers and is ""suppressed"" by being put into a canvas bag. The Hatter is dismissed, and the Queen orders his head off, but he escapes. The next witness is the **Duchess's Cook**, carrying a pepper-box. She refuses to give evidence. The King, cross-examining, asks what tarts are made of. The Cook says ""Pepper, mostly,"" and the Dormouse (from behind) adds ""Treacle."" The Queen, enraged, orders the Dormouse beheaded, and in the ensuing confusion, the Cook disappears.

Finally, the White Rabbit calls the last witness: **Alice**. Alice, forgetting her immense size, jumps up and knocks over the jury-box, scattering the jurymen. She quickly puts them back, including Bill the Lizard who she initially put in upside down. The King asks Alice what she knows about the business. Alice replies, ""Nothing whatever."" The King attempts to declare this ""important,"" but the White Rabbit corrects him to ""unimportant."" The King then reads ""Rule Forty-two: _All persons more than a mile high to leave the court_."" Everyone looks at Alice, who is now very large. Alice denies being a mile high and argues the rule was just invented. The King, flustered, tells the jury to consider their verdict.

The White Rabbit then announces new evidence: a paper just picked up, containing a set of verses, not in the prisoner's handwriting. The King insists it proves the Knave's guilt, but Alice loudly disagrees, stating they don't even know what the verses mean. The King orders the White Rabbit to read the nonsensical verses. The King tries to interpret the verses as evidence against the Knave, even finding a pun. The Queen demands ""Sentence first—verdict afterwards!"" Alice vehemently protests, calling it ""Stuff and nonsense!"" The Queen, turning purple, screams, ""Off with her head!"" But Alice, having grown to her full size, declares, ""Who cares for you? You're nothing but a pack of cards!""

At this, the entire pack of cards flies up into the air and rains down upon her. Alice screams and tries to beat them off. Suddenly, she finds herself lying on the riverbank, her head in her sister's lap. Her sister gently brushes away leaves and tells her to wake up from her long sleep. Alice exclaims about her ""curious dream"" and recounts all her strange adventures to her sister. Her sister listens, then sends Alice off for tea. Alice runs off, still thinking about her wonderful dream.

Alice's sister remains on the bank, dreaming of Alice's adventures, recalling the White Rabbit, the frightened Mouse, the tea-party, the Queen's commands, the pig-baby, the Gryphon, the Lizard's slate-pencil, the suppressed guinea-pigs, and the Mock Turtle's sobs. She imagines these fantastical sounds transforming back into the ordinary sounds of nature and a farm-yard. Finally, she pictures Alice as a grown woman, preserving the loving heart of her childhood, and sharing these strange tales of Wonderland with other children, evoking in them the same wonder and joy."
Anna Karenina-Leo Tolstoy,"The story begins in the Oblonsky household in Moscow, where Darya Alexandrovna, known as Dolly, has discovered her husband, Prince Stepan Arkadyevitch Oblonsky (Stiva), is having an affair with their French governess. This revelation has thrown the family into disarray, with Dolly refusing to live with Stiva and the household staff in confusion. Stiva, while acknowledging his fault, struggles with genuine remorse, attributing Dolly's extreme reaction to his ""idiotic smile"" when confronted. He believes his wife, being older and less attractive, should have been more indulgent.

Stiva learns via telegram that his sister, Anna Arkadyevna Karenina, is coming from Petersburg. He and his valet, Matvey, hope Anna's arrival will facilitate a reconciliation with Dolly. Dolly, however, initially refuses to see Anna.

Meanwhile, Konstantin Dmitrievitch Levin, an old childhood friend of Stiva and the Shtcherbatsky family, arrives in Moscow with the firm intention of proposing to Kitty Shtcherbatskaya, Dolly's younger sister. Levin is deeply in love with Kitty, viewing her as a perfect, almost unearthly being, and feeling himself unworthy and lacking a definitive social standing compared to his peers. He had previously left Moscow after an earlier attempt at courtship, convinced it was impossible, but now returns resolved.

At the Zoological Gardens, where Kitty is skating, Levin approaches her. Their interaction is charged with emotion. Kitty, initially warm, becomes reserved when Levin, flustered, hints at his deeper feelings. Soon after, Vronsky, a charming and wealthy officer, arrives. Kitty's eyes brighten noticeably when she sees him, confirming Levin's fears that she loves Vronsky. Levin, seeing this, is heartbroken and leaves abruptly.

That evening, Kitty tells her mother about Levin's proposal and her refusal, believing she acted correctly. She feels pity for Levin but is also happy, yet her happiness is ""poisoned by doubts"" because she remembers Vronsky. Upstairs, the Prince and Princess argue about Kitty's suitors. The Prince strongly favors Levin, criticizing Vronsky as a mere ""peacock"" who is only ""amusing himself"" and blaming his wife for ""disgracing"" their daughter with her matchmaking. The Princess, however, favors Vronsky for his wealth and social standing, though she secretly worries he might not have serious intentions.

Vronsky, unaware of the Shtcherbatskys' domestic turmoil, feels a strong ""spiritual bond"" with Kitty. He dismisses marriage as ""ridiculous"" but is delighted by Kitty's affection.

Anna arrives in Moscow and, through her compassionate and direct approach, successfully mediates a reconciliation between Dolly and Stiva. Dolly, initially bitter about Stiva's infidelity and her own ""humiliating"" position, is moved by Anna's genuine sympathy and argument that Stiva's home and wife are ""sacred"" to him, and his lapse was ""not an infidelity of the heart."" Dolly confesses her enduring love for Stiva and accepts Anna's advice to forgive him completely.

At a ball later, Kitty is entranced by Vronsky. She observes Anna and Vronsky dancing, and sees Anna's intoxicating effect on Vronsky, while also noticing Vronsky's ""humble submission and dread"" in Anna's presence. Kitty realizes her ""unhappiness was complete,"" confirming Vronsky's love is directed elsewhere. Anna, too, feels the growing intensity of her connection with Vronsky, which leaves her agitated and excited.

Levin, in Moscow, visits his sick brother Nikolay, who is dying of consumption. Nikolay is emaciated and irritable, struggling with his past and his current life with Marya Nikolaevna, a woman he lives with but has ""got rid of"" due to her ""horrid"" nature, only to return to her. Levin is deeply distressed by his brother's condition and confronts his own mortality and lack of purpose. Nikolay, despite his illness, maintains his cynical views on society and human endeavor.

Kitty, heartbroken and unwell after the ball, goes abroad with her family to a German watering-place. She is drawn to Varenka, a serene and philanthropic Russian woman, and attempts to emulate her spiritual, altruistic lifestyle, finding temporary solace. However, this new path is disrupted when a sick artist, Petrov, to whom Kitty offers help, develops an inappropriate attachment, causing discomfort. Her father, the Prince, also returns, his down-to-earth perspective and jests disrupt Kitty's idealized view of her new friends. She realizes the superficiality of some of the piety she admired and the underlying self-interest in people.

Back in Petersburg, Anna's affair with Vronsky deepens. After a horse race where Vronsky is injured, Anna, in a moment of intense emotion, confesses her infidelity to Alexey Alexandrovitch. He is enraged, deciding to divorce her and take their son, Seryozha. He consults a lawyer, but his religious scruples and desire to avoid public scandal lead him to decide against a formal divorce. Instead, he insists on maintaining an ""external _status quo_,"" demanding Anna cease all contact with Vronsky and observe social proprieties, implicitly to punish her.

Anna falls gravely ill after childbirth (delivering a daughter, who is Vronsky's child). Alexey Alexandrovitch, believing her to be dying, is overcome with Christian forgiveness and pity for her, and for Vronsky, who had attempted suicide in despair. This experience brings Alexey Alexandrovitch a profound sense of spiritual peace. He agrees to Anna's request for a divorce. He also develops a tender affection for the newborn baby, despite knowing it is not his.

However, Anna does not die. Recovered, she finds herself isolated in Petersburg society, shunned by former friends except Princess Betsy, and longs to see her son, Seryozha, whom Alexey Alexandrovitch now forbids her to see. Countess Lidia Ivanovna, Alexey Alexandrovitch's pious confidante, takes over the management of his household and Seryozha's education, actively working to keep Anna separated from her son. Anna makes a desperate, secret visit to Seryozha on his birthday, which is a tender but painful reunion, ending in his distress and her swift departure before Alexey Alexandrovitch discovers her presence.

Levin, after his initial rejection and a period of despair and intellectual searching, experiences a spiritual awakening during a night spent on a haycock. He questions his reliance on reason and intellectual pursuits, realizing that true meaning and goodness come from an intuitive faith and a simple, laborious life connected to the land and the people. He reconciles with Kitty, who confirms her love for him through a playful exchange of chalked initials. They marry.

After their wedding, Levin and Kitty return to his country estate. Their initial married life is marked by unexpected quarrels stemming from their adjustments to each other and from Levin's lingering jealousy and perfectionism. However, they soon settle into a comfortable rhythm. Kitty, now pregnant, embraces her role as mistress of the house, enjoying domestic duties and showing a new strength of character. Levin dedicates himself to his agricultural reforms, finding purpose in his work and a profound, if sometimes complicated, love for his wife.

Anna and Vronsky, meanwhile, are living together in Moscow, waiting for Alexey Alexandrovitch to grant the divorce. Anna grows increasingly jealous and irritable, feeling Vronsky's love waning and her social position as a fallen woman unbearable. Vronsky, feeling stifled by her demands and her situation, becomes cold and distant. Their relationship is strained by constant conflict. Anna, haunted by the memory of a prophetic nightmare, begins to contemplate suicide as the only escape from her misery and a way to punish Vronsky.

One evening, after a particularly bitter quarrel, Anna sends Vronsky a note begging him to return, but he, angered by her ""threats"" and her refusal to understand his need for independence, goes out instead. Anna, filled with despair and a desire for revenge, sees Vronsky with Princess Sorokina, confirming her fears of his indifference. She decides to go to the railway station.

At the station, as she awaits the train, Anna is overwhelmed by a rush of memories and self-reproach. She recalls the man crushed by a train on the day she first met Vronsky, and a sudden, terrible clarity descends upon her: death is the only escape. Despite a fleeting resurgence of joyful childhood memories, she fixates on the wheels of an approaching train. She drops her red bag and throws herself under the second carriage, dying instantly.

Two months later, Sergey Ivanovitch learns of Anna's death. He and Katavasov are at a train station, witnessing a crowd of volunteers departing for the Servian War. Sergey Ivanovitch finds the public's enthusiasm for the war a ""manifestation of public opinion,"" a new purpose. Vronsky is also at the station, looking aged and worn, on his way to Servia with a squadron he has raised at his own expense. He is consumed by grief and guilt over Anna's death, which he sees as his fault. He views life as worthless and welcomes the war as a means to ""meet death.""

Levin, now a father to a son named Mitya, continues his life in the country. He grapples with his faith and the meaning of life, realizing that intellectual reasoning alone cannot provide answers. He finds profound spiritual peace in the simple truths of Christianity and in his love for his family, despite the ongoing challenges and his own imperfections. He embraces his life, finding meaning in ""the positive meaning of goodness"" he has the power to put into it."
Crime and Punishment-Fyodor Dostoyevsky,"Raskolnikov, a young, impoverished former student living in a cramped garret in S. Place, is deeply in debt to his landlady. On a hot July evening, he leaves his lodging, avoiding his landlady. He mutters to himself about attempting a significant, unstated ""thing"" and expresses frustration at minor fears, like his conspicuous hat, which he believes could compromise his ""plan."" He walks slowly towards a large house, counting the 730 steps, feeling a growing excitement for a ""rehearsal"" of his ""project.""

He enters the large house, where he knows only an old woman lives on the fourth floor. He rings her bell, and she, Alyona Ivanovna, a small, withered, suspicious pawnbroker, opens the door. Raskolnikov, introducing himself as a student, offers to pawn an old silver watch. The old woman, remembering his previous visit, offers a paltry price, deducting interest from a previous pledge. Raskolnikov is angered but accepts, noting her keys and suspecting a strong-box. He receives a small sum. As he leaves, he casually asks if her sister, Lizaveta, is always home. He then experiences intense repulsion for his plan, dismissing it as ""nonsense.""

Seeking distraction, Raskolnikov enters a tavern. He meets Marmeladov, a drunken, retired titular counsellor, who launches into a long, self-pitying confession. Marmeladov describes his educated wife, Katerina Ivanovna, who is consumptive and works tirelessly for their three starving children. He admits to stealing his wife's money for drink and to having just taken the last 30 copecks from his daughter, Sonia, who supports the family through prostitution. Marmeladov delivers a dramatic speech about suffering and divine forgiveness for Sonia. He asks Raskolnikov to escort him home.

At Marmeladov's squalid lodging, Katerina Ivanovna confronts her husband, violently searching him for money. Finding none, she drags him by his hair, accusing him of squandering their last cent while the children starve. Raskolnikov, unseen, leaves a few coppers on the windowsill before departing, but later regrets it, thinking Sonia will need money for ""smartness."" He questions his own morality.

The next day, Raskolnikov awakens ill and irritable. His landlady, Praskovya Pavlovna, threatens to report him to the police for unpaid rent. He receives a letter from his mother, detailing his sister Dounia's ordeal as a governess. Dounia was harassed by her employer, Mr. Svidrigaïlov, who made improper advances. His wife, Marfa Petrovna, mistakenly blamed Dounia and publicly disgraced her, only to later clear her name upon discovering Dounia's letter rejecting Svidrigaïlov. Dounia is now engaged to Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin, a wealthy, practical man, who seeks a poor wife he can control. His mother and Dounia are coming to Petersburg, hoping Luzhin will help Raskolnikov's career.

Raskolnikov is enraged by the letter, seeing Dounia's marriage as a sacrifice for his benefit. He vows to prevent it, realizing his own poverty prevents him from offering an alternative. He wanders outside, observing a young, drunken girl being preyed upon by a dandy. He intervenes, giving a policeman money to help her, but then, in a sudden fit of apathy, tells the policeman to ""let them be."" He reflects on the ""percentage"" of society destined for ruin. He has a vivid dream of a peasant cruelly beating a weak horse to death. This dream sickens him, making him renounce his murderous ""accursed dream."" However, he then overhears Lizaveta Ivanovna discussing with a huckster that she will be out at seven o'clock the next day. This unexpected information rekindles his resolve, as it provides a perfect opportunity for his plan to murder Alyona Ivanovna.

He meticulously prepares a fake pledge (a piece of wood with iron) and a concealed noose for an axe in his coat. He almost gives up, but a chance discovery of an axe in the porter's empty room solidifies his intent. He goes to Alyona Ivanovna's flat. She lets him in, still suspicious. He strikes her head with the blunt side of the axe, then repeatedly, until she is dead. He then discovers Lizaveta Ivanovna, unexpectedly returning, staring in horror at her murdered sister. In a panic, Raskolnikov strikes Lizaveta with the sharp edge of the axe, killing her instantly. Overwhelmed by fear and loathing, he cleans the axe and his hands. He hides the stolen money and jewels from a box under a stone in a deserted yard.

A summons to the police station for his unpaid IOU causes him immense anxiety, as he fears they know about the murder. At the police station, the discussion of the pawnbroker murder (specifically the open door and the suspects, Koch and Pestryakov, being ruled out in favor of a painter named Nikolay) greatly agitates him. He faints. When he recovers, he provocatively taunts the head clerk, Zametov, with hints of his own involvement in the murder, describing how he would have hidden the stolen goods. Zametov is visibly unnerved. Raskolnikov's mother and Dounia arrive in Petersburg and come to his lodging, finding him in a fever. He demands Dounia break off her engagement to Luzhin, calling it a sacrifice for his sake. During this agitated conversation, Raskolnikov again collapses in a faint.

Razumihin, who has become fond of Dounia, takes charge, arranging for Zossimov (the doctor) to care for Raskolnikov and for Dounia and her mother to stay at Bakaleyev's, a nearby lodging. Razumihin reveals to Zossimov that Raskolnikov's ""fixed idea"" about the murder might be linked to his illness and a suspicion from the police.

At Raskolnikov's room, Luzhin arrives for his meeting with Dounia. Raskolnikov, despite his weakness, vehemently exposes Luzhin's mercenary motives for marrying Dounia and his slanderous accusations against Sonia. Dounia, now fully aware of Luzhin's character, breaks off the engagement and demands he leave. Luzhin, furious, blames Raskolnikov.

Shortly after, Sonia comes to Raskolnikov's room, inviting him to her father's funeral. Raskolnikov, in a feverish state, confesses to Sonia that he murdered Alyona Ivanovna and Lizaveta, explaining his theory of ""extraordinary"" men having the right to transgress moral laws. He confesses his motive was to test his own strength and determine if he was an ""extraordinary man"" like Napoleon. Sonia is horrified but expresses profound pity and love, urging him to confess publicly to find God and new life. Unknown to them, Svidrigaïlov has been listening to their entire conversation through a crack in the wall from the adjacent empty room.

Katerina Ivanovna's mental state rapidly deteriorates after her husband's death. She takes her children, dressed in makeshift costumes, into the street to beg, attempting to garner sympathy by highlighting their ""genteel"" background. She collapses, spitting blood, and is carried to Sonia's room, where she dies. Svidrigaïlov then reveals to Raskolnikov that he has made provisions for Katerina Ivanovna's children, settling money on them and arranging for their placement in institutions, effectively using the 10,000 roubles he had offered Dounia. He casually mentions he overheard Raskolnikov's confession to Sonia, confirming his knowledge of the murder.

Raskolnikov, overwhelmed, confronts Svidrigaïlov, warning him to abandon any designs on Dounia. Svidrigaïlov, cynical and depraved, recounts his own past, including his dead wife Marfa Petrovna's ghostly visitations and his plans to marry a 16-year-old girl. He also describes another young girl he ""befriended."" Dounia, arriving to confront Svidrigaïlov (due to a letter from him hinting at Raskolnikov's secret), is lured to his room. He confesses to having listened to Raskolnikov's confession to Sonia. He tries to coerce Dounia, declaring his love and offering to save Raskolnikov if she yields to him. Dounia pulls out a revolver and shoots at him, grazing his head. After a second misfire, she throws the weapon away. Svidrigaïlov, realizing she will never love him, gives her the key to the locked door and lets her go. He spends his final hours in taverns and then a squalid hotel, experiencing disturbing nightmares. At dawn, Svidrigaïlov goes to a public place by the Little Neva, gives a cryptic message to a guard, and shoots himself in the head.

Raskolnikov, after a final, tender conversation with his mother, who intuitively senses his great sorrow, and Dounia, who understands his guilt through Razumihin, makes his way to the police station. He hesitates, but driven by a strange compulsion, he goes to the Hay Market, where he bows down and kisses the earth, recalling Sonia's words. He then proceeds to the police station. He finds Ilya Petrovitch and, with white lips, confesses: ""It was I killed the old pawnbroker woman and her sister Lizaveta with an axe and robbed them.""

**Epilogue:**
Raskolnikov is confined to a Siberian prison for eight years of penal servitude. His trial reveals his full, clear confession, including the detail of the fake pledge and hiding the valuables under a stone without using them. Psychologists argue for temporary mental derangement, which, along with extenuating circumstances (his prior charity, rescuing children from a fire), leads to a more lenient sentence.

His mother falls ill during the trial and dies of brain fever, having suspected a terrible secret about her son. Dounia marries Razumihin. They plan to eventually move to Siberia to be near Raskolnikov. Sonia, using the money from Svidrigaïlov, follows Raskolnikov to Siberia. Raskolnikov initially remains sullen and indifferent in prison, feeling no true repentance, only wounded pride and shame at his ""blunder."" He believes his theory of extraordinary men was right, only that he failed. He endures a horrifying dream of a plague of madness afflicting the world.

Eventually, as he recovers from illness, he sees Sonia at the prison gate. Overwhelmed by her unwavering love and presence, he falls to her feet, weeping. This moment marks a profound turning point, a realization of his love for her and a softening of his heart. He finds renewal through love, feeling a new life beginning. The story concludes with the promise of his ""gradual renewal"" and ""regeneration."""
Death in Venice-Thomas Mann,"On a spring afternoon in Munich, Gustav Aschenbach, a renowned writer, takes a long walk after a demanding morning of work, feeling overwrought and unable to find rest. He observes an unusually dressed, red-haired man at a cemetery tram station, whose militant stare makes Aschenbach uncomfortable. This encounter unexpectedly sparks in Aschenbach an intense, youthful longing for travel, a desire to escape his disciplined, solitary life and its ""coldly passionate service."" He fantasizes about exotic, tropical landscapes and decides to take a three-to-four-week trip to a southern resort.

Aschenbach is a celebrated author, ennobled on his fiftieth birthday, known for his rigorous, disciplined approach to art, which he views as a ""destructive battle."" Despite not being robust, he had cultivated a dignified, formal style, moving away from youthful skepticism. His personal life saw the early death of his wife, leaving him with a married daughter but no son. His artistic life has left deep marks on his aging, tired face.

Two weeks later, Aschenbach departs for Trieste, then Pola, seeking a foreign destination. He stops at an Adriatic island but finds it dissatisfying due to bad weather and the lack of a sandy beach. Feeling a persistent internal disturbance, he abruptly decides to leave for Venice. On the ship to Venice, he encounters a theatrical ticket-seller and observes a group of young revelers, among whom is an old man meticulously disguised as a youth with paint, a wig, and false teeth. Aschenbach is horrified and feels a dream-like distortion of reality. After an unpleasant meal with the drunken old fop, the ship arrives in Venice under dreary skies.

Upon disembarking, Aschenbach takes a gondola to reach the Lido, where he intends to stay by the sea. The gondolier, a brutal and insolent man, refuses to take him to the public steamer dock, insisting on rowing him directly to the Lido. Aschenbach feels helpless and suspects the gondolier is a criminal or trying to cheat him, yet a ""poison of inertia"" prevents him from resisting effectively. After a brief encounter with singing brigands, Aschenbach reaches the Lido. When he goes to get change for the gondolier, the man, who turns out to be unlicensed, vanishes without payment.

Aschenbach settles into a hotel on the Lido. That evening, he observes a Polish aristocratic family in the lobby: three severely dressed girls and their fourteen-year-old brother, Tadzio, whose ""godlike beauty"" reminds Aschenbach of Greek sculpture. Tadzio, with his honey-colored hair and serious expression, catches Aschenbach's eye.

The next day, the weather remains poor, and Aschenbach considers leaving, recalling a previous illness he suffered in Venice. However, at breakfast, Tadzio reappears, moving with captivating charm. Aschenbach is again struck by the boy's beauty, though he notices Tadzio's teeth are pale and brittle, suggesting he is sickly and may not live long—a thought that strangely gratifies Aschenbach. Despite his earlier intentions to leave, Aschenbach finds himself deciding to stay in Venice, captivated by Tadzio. He attempts to write on the beach, inspired by Tadzio, but finds himself distracted by the boy's presence and activities. He watches Tadzio playing with other children, especially a boy named Jaschu, who kisses him. Aschenbach deduces Tadzio's name and is deeply moved watching him emerge from the sea, a sight that evokes mythological images.

Later that afternoon, Aschenbach visits Venice, but the oppressive sultriness, foul smells, and crowds reaffirm his decision to leave. He makes plans to depart the following morning for another watering place. He regrets his decision during a restless night and at breakfast, but the hotel staff rush him, further solidifying his intention to leave. As he bids silent farewell to Tadzio, he feels a pang of regret. On the steamboat journey away from Venice, he is overcome with intense sorrow and realizes how deeply attached he is to the city, feeling it is now a forbidden place. However, at the train station, a clerical error results in his trunk being mistakenly sent to Como. Aschenbach is seized by ""adventurous delight"" at this mishap, which provides him with a pretext to return to the Lido hotel. He feels a sense of fate, relief, and even hilarity, realizing that Tadzio was the true reason he found it so hard to leave. Back in an identical room, he accepts his situation with a ""spontaneous act of welcome.""

Days turn into weeks of sunny weather. Aschenbach's will is relaxed, and he finds deep contentment at the Lido, spending hours watching Tadzio on the beach. He constantly observes and admires the boy's ""godlike sculpture,"" associating his beauty with philosophical ideas about art and the spirit, envisioning him as a Hyacinth loved by gods. Tadzio's beauty becomes Aschenbach's artistic inspiration, and he works on a prose piece while observing the boy, feeling an ""exhilaration."" He attempts to approach Tadzio one morning but is overcome by physical and emotional turmoil, his heart pounding, and he retreats. He no longer wishes for ""soberness,"" finding his ""intoxication"" too precious. He stops thinking about leaving, sends for more money, and watches Tadzio, ignoring the passing time. He awakens early, witnessing the sunrise in a mythical light, and whispers Tadzio's name. Tadzio seems to notice Aschenbach's attention, sometimes deliberately walking close to him and their glances meet. One evening, Tadzio smiles directly at Aschenbach, a captivating, ""Narcissus"" like smile, which drives Aschenbach into the darkness of the garden, where he whispers, ""I love you!""

In his fourth week, Aschenbach notices fewer guests and overhears the barber mention a ""plague."" He investigates in Venice, detecting a ""sweetish and drug-like"" smell and seeing municipal warnings for gastric diseases—euphemisms for a concealed epidemic. He learns from newspapers that authorities are suppressing news of an Indian cholera outbreak in Venice to protect tourism. He feels a ""dark contentment"" and complicity in this secret, as it ensures Tadzio's continued presence. He begins to stalk Tadzio, following him through Venice's labyrinthine streets, enduring physical exhaustion and moral degradation, even hiring a gondola to pursue Tadzio's family. One night, he presses his head against Tadzio's room door, ""in utter drunkenness.""

Despite moments of alarm, Aschenbach rationalizes his behavior by connecting his passion to the ""Eros"" revered by ancient heroes. He continues seeking reliable news of the plague, eventually extracting the truth from an English travel clerk. The clerk confirms a severe cholera outbreak, with high fatality rates and a cover-up by authorities, leading to demoralization, crime, and poisoning of victims. Aschenbach is advised to leave immediately, but he whispers, ""I will keep silent!"" and decides to remain, finding a perverse ""intoxication"" in his ""share in the facts and the guilt,"" seeing ""advantages of chaos.""

That night, Aschenbach has a terrifying dream of a pagan ritual, a wild bacchanal with frenzied dancing, lewdness, and sacrifice to a ""foreign god."" He feels his resistance crushed and his soul tastes ""unchastity and fury of decay."" He awakens shattered, openly disregarding others' suspicions as guests flee the emptying hotel. Tadzio and his family, however, remain. Aschenbach, now unconcerned with morality, begins to rejuvenate his appearance, dying his hair black, curling it, and applying cosmetics to his face to appear youthful. The barber tells him, ""Now the gentleman can fall in love unhesitatingly.""

A storm rises, filling the air with the smell of rotting things. Aschenbach, tracking Tadzio through the diseased city, feels the food is poisoned. Tadzio, aware of Aschenbach's pursuit, occasionally looks back, ""not betraying him,"" alluring the lover. Aschenbach eventually loses sight of Tadzio in the winding alleys. Exhausted and feverish, he rests by a cistern, surrounded by the smell of carbolic acid. In a semi-conscious state, he reflects on the corrupted nature of the artist's path to beauty, concluding that it is a ""perilous,"" ""sinful"" road leading to ""intoxication and to desire,"" to the ""precipice.""

A few days later, feeling unwell with vertigo and malaise, Aschenbach learns that Tadzio's family is finally leaving after lunch. He goes to the deserted, dirty beach. He observes Tadzio and his few remaining companions. Jaschu, the stocky boy, violently wrestles Tadzio, pinning his face in the sand, nearly strangling him. Aschenbach is enraged but does not intervene. Tadzio, pale and disheveled, slowly walks to a sandbank in the sea. He stands there, a solitary figure against the mists, then turns and looks back at Aschenbach, seemingly smiling and nodding, ""vaguely guiding towards egregious promises."" Aschenbach, as if to follow, tries to stand up but collapses in his chair. Later that day, the world receives the news of his death."
Don Quixote-Miguel de Cervantes,"The story begins in a village in La Mancha, where an unnamed gentleman, nearing fifty, lives a modest life with his housekeeper, his niece, and a farm lad. He owns a lance, a buckler, a lean hack, and a greyhound. This gentleman becomes consumed by reading books of chivalry, neglecting his property and field sports, and even selling land to acquire more of these books. He particularly admires the works of Feliciano de Silva. His obsession drives him to lose his wits, believing the fantastical events in these books to be true history. He frequently argues with his village curate and barber about the merits of various knights, concluding that he must become a knight-errant himself to revive the practice and bring renown to himself and his country.

His first steps involve cleaning his great-grandfather's rusty armor, making a makeshift closed helmet from pasteboard (which breaks on the first test, then is reinforced with iron). He spends four days naming his hack ""Rocinante"" to reflect its new, elevated status. He then names himself ""Don Quixote,"" adding ""of La Mancha"" to honor his homeland. Finally, he decides he needs a lady love, choosing a local farm-girl named Aldonza Lorenzo, whom he renames ""Dulcinea del Toboso.""

One hot July morning, Don Quixote secretly sallies forth on Rocinante. A terrible thought strikes him: he hasn't been dubbed a knight. He resolves to be knighted by the first person he meets. He rides all day, imitating knightly speeches and addressing his imagined lady. Towards nightfall, he mistakes an inn for a castle. He sees two young women (local girls) at the door, imagining them as fair maidens, and a swineherd's horn blast as a dwarf's trumpet. He courteously addresses the ""ladies,"" but his appearance and language make them laugh. The innkeeper, a fat man, emerges, amused but also awed by Don Quixote's full armor. Don Quixote addresses him as ""Sir Castellan."" He dismounts with difficulty and insists on special care for Rocinante. The girls help remove his breastplate, but he refuses to take off his makeshift helmet, which is tied on with ribbons. He eats a meager supper of stockfish (which he believes is trout), fed by one of the girls because his helmet prevents him from eating himself. A sowgelder's pipe convinces him he is being entertained with music. He remains distressed that he is not yet a dubbed knight.

That night, Don Quixote kneels before the innkeeper in the stable, demanding to be dubbed a knight the next morning, after watching his arms. The innkeeper, realizing his guest is mad, decides to humor him. He explains there's no chapel, so the courtyard will do. He also advises Don Quixote that knights-errant, though not usually written about, always carry money, clean shirts, and ointments, and should have squires. Don Quixote promises to follow this advice. He places his armor on a trough by a well and begins his watch.

Later, a carrier tries to water his mules and moves Don Quixote's armor. Don Quixote warns him, then, invoking Dulcinea, strikes the carrier senseless with his lance. He resumes his watch. Another carrier approaches, and Don Quixote strikes him too, wounding him severely. An uproar ensues, with the carriers' comrades throwing stones at Don Quixote, who defends himself with his buckler. The innkeeper intervenes, explaining Don Quixote's madness. To get rid of him, the landlord performs a burlesque knighting ceremony using his account-book for prayers. One of the girls, La Tolosa, girds on his sword, and Don Quixote renames her Doña Tolosa. The other, La Molinera, buckles his spur, and he renames her Doña Molinera. Don Quixote, now a knight, thanks the host and rides off without paying.

Don Quixote, joyful in his new knighthood, remembers the advice about money and a squire. He decides to return home. On the way, he hears cries and finds a youth, Andres, being flogged by a farmer over wages. Don Quixote intervenes, ordering the farmer to pay Andres. The farmer agrees to pay at home. Don Quixote rides off, satisfied. However, once Don Quixote is out of sight, the farmer ties Andres up again and flogs him worse. Andres vows to find Don Quixote.

Don Quixote then encounters a group of Toledo traders. He blocks their path, demanding they confess Dulcinea's unparalleled beauty. The traders, realizing he is mad, mock him, asking for a portrait. Enraged, Don Quixote charges, but Rocinante stumbles, and both fall. A muleteer from the group breaks Don Quixote's lance and beats him severely. The traders leave him for dead. Don Quixote, battered and unable to move, recites lines from a chivalry ballad. A peasant from his village, Pedro Alonso, finds him, recognizes him as ""Señor Quixada,"" and, realizing his madness, puts him on his ass and takes him home. Don Quixote, still delusional, believes the peasant is a noble from a romance.

At Don Quixote's house, the curate, the barber (Master Nicholas), his housekeeper, and his niece are distressed by his absence. They blame his chivalry books and plan to burn them. Don Quixote is put to bed, claiming his bruises are from fighting ten giants. The next day, the curate and barber inspect his library, burning many books of chivalry but sparing ""Amadis of Gaul,"" ""Palmerin of England,"" ""Tirante el Blanco,"" and some pastoral and heroic poems. They wall up the room, telling Don Quixote a magician stole the books.

Fifteen days later, Don Quixote, seemingly calm, is persuaded by Sancho Panza, a poor farm laborer, to become his squire with promises of an island to govern. Don Quixote, having sold and pawned property, acquires some money and a buckler. He repairs his helmet. They set off at night. Don Quixote promises Sancho kingdoms.

They soon encounter thirty or forty windmills, which Don Quixote mistakes for giants. Sancho tries to convince him otherwise, but Don Quixote charges. His lance gets caught in a sail, and he and Rocinante are thrown. Don Quixote claims a magician, Friston, transformed the giants into windmills to thwart him. He then makes a new lance from a tree branch. He tells Sancho that knights-errant are forbidden to complain of wounds, but squires are not. Sancho eats heartily from his *alforjas*.

Near Puerto Lapice, Don Quixote warns Sancho not to attack knights. They see two Benedictine friars and a coach. Don Quixote again imagines they are kidnappers. He charges, unhorsing one friar. Sancho, believing it to be battle spoil, begins to strip the friar. Muleteers beat Sancho. The friars escape. Don Quixote demands the lady in the coach go to El Toboso and present herself to Dulcinea. A Biscayan squire challenges Don Quixote. They begin a duel.

The narrator, lamenting the incomplete history, discovers Arabic manuscripts by Cid Hamete Benengeli. A translator reveals a note about Dulcinea salting pigs. The translation continues the duel: the Biscayan wounds Don Quixote, taking part of his ear and helmet. Don Quixote retaliates, knocking the Biscayan unconscious. Don Quixote spares the Biscayan on condition he present himself to Dulcinea.

Sancho, recovering, again asks for an island. Don Quixote calls this a ""cross-roads"" adventure. Don Quixote then talks about his miraculous balsam of Fierabras, which can cure any wound. Sancho, eager for the recipe, offers to give up his island. Don Quixote vows not to live comfortably until he gets a new helmet. Sancho complains about the hardships of squire life and the lack of proper food. They spend a night with goatherds, where Don Quixote delivers a long discourse on the Golden Age. A goatherd, Pedro, tells the story of Chrysostom, a student-shepherd who died of love for the beautiful, elusive shepherdess Marcela. Marcela appears and defends her freedom and chastity, declaring she never gave Chrysostom hope. Don Quixote defends Marcela from those who would follow her.

Continuing their journey, they stop in a glade. Rocinante is kicked and injured by Yanguesan carriers' mares. Don Quixote and Sancho are beaten by the carriers. Sancho asks for the balsam. Don Quixote blames himself for fighting commoners, which is against chivalric law, but promises the balsam. He laments his lost teeth. Sancho blames the enchantment and his master's madness. They reach an inn. Don Quixote believes it's a castle. He is bruised, and his bed is poor. Maritornes (an Asturian servant) and the innkeeper's daughter tend to him. Don Quixote, mistaking Maritornes for a noble lady, pulls her to his bed. The carrier, her lover, jealous, beats Don Quixote. A brawl breaks out in the dark. A Holy Brotherhood officer intervenes, thinking Don Quixote is dead. The officer then hits Don Quixote with a lamp. Don Quixote uses ingredients (oil, wine, salt, rosemary) to make his balsam, drinks it, vomits violently, but then feels cured. Sancho drinks it, suffers terribly, and also recovers. Don Quixote refuses to pay the innkeeper, citing knightly custom. Sancho also refuses. The innkeeper's guests blanket Sancho as punishment. Don Quixote, believing himself enchanted, cannot help. Sancho is eventually released.

Don Quixote and Sancho continue their journey. Don Quixote believes Sancho's account of the blanketing is due to enchantment. Sancho, knowing better, suggests they return home. Don Quixote argues for the glory of knight-errantry. They see dust clouds, which Don Quixote mistakes for two armies. He charges the ""army"" (actually a flock of sheep), spearing several. Shepherds stone him, breaking his balsam flask and some teeth. Sancho is disgusted. Don Quixote claims enchanters changed the armies. Sancho accidentally vomits balsam on Don Quixote's beard. Sancho discovers his *alforjas* (with his food) are missing. Don Quixote laments his lost teeth.

They encounter a procession of encamisados (figures in white) carrying a black-draped litter. Don Quixote believes they are villains carrying off a lady. He charges, unhorsing one, who reveals himself to be a bachelor of arts named Alonzo Lopez, and the litter holds a dead gentleman's bones for burial. Don Quixote, calling himself ""the Knight of the Rueful Countenance,"" apologizes for the misunderstanding. Sancho, meanwhile, loots a sumpter mule from the party.

Sancho secretly ties Rocinante's legs to prevent Don Quixote from rushing into a perceived peril (mysterious sounds). Don Quixote, believing it's enchantment, patiently waits until dawn reveals the source of the noise: six fulling hammers. Don Quixote is mortified, but Sancho laughs, earning him two blows from Don Quixote's pike. Don Quixote then sees a man with a shining object on his head, believing it to be Mambrino's helmet. He attacks the man (a barber with a brass basin on his head), who flees. Don Quixote takes the basin as the helmet, believing it to be transformed by enchanters. Sancho takes the barber's pack-saddle for Dapple.

They return to the inn. They find the captive (Ruy Perez de Viedma) and the veiled woman (Luscinda) with Don Fernando and Dorothea. All their stories intertwine, revealing a complex love triangle. Don Fernando, having eloped with Luscinda, is confronted by Cardenio (Luscinda's true love) and Dorothea (Don Fernando's jilted lover). Moved by Dorothea's impassioned plea, Don Fernando repents and agrees to marry her, releasing Luscinda to Cardenio. Everyone is reconciled, to Don Quixote's oblivious satisfaction.

Sancho is dismayed to learn that Micomicona is Dorothea, and the giant Don Fernando, dashing his hopes for a county. Don Quixote, however, remains convinced of the giant battle, attributing Sancho's reports of wine-skins to enchantment. He still believes Dorothea is the enchanted princess. Don Quixote, enraged by Sancho's comment about the duchess being fairer than Dulcinea, attacks Sancho with his pike. Sancho then spots Ricote (Gines de Pasamonte), disguised as a pilgrim, riding Dapple. Sancho reclaims his ass. Don Quixote and Sancho discuss Dulcinea's ""enchantment,"" with Sancho admitting his lie but Don Quixote attributing it to enchanters. Don Quixote decides to become a shepherd for a year (as part of his defeat conditions) and invites his friends to join him.

At the castle, the Duke and Duchess, having read the first part of Don Quixote's history, decide to play a series of elaborate jokes on him. They arrange a ""distressed duenna"" adventure. A majordomo, disguised as the bearded Countess Trifaldi, with twelve other bearded duennas, arrives, seeking Don Quixote's help to remove their facial hair, caused by the giant Malambruno. Malambruno, she says, will send a flying wooden horse, Clavileño, to take Don Quixote and Sancho to Kandy for the combat. Sancho initially refuses to participate but is persuaded by the duke's promise of the island. Don Quixote and Sancho are blindfolded and mounted on the wooden horse. The duke's servants use bellows and fireworks to simulate a flight through the air and a fiery crash. When they remove their blindfolds, they find themselves back in the same garden, with a placard stating the adventure is complete and the duennas are shaved. Altisidora appears, pretending to have been dead from Don Quixote's scorn and revived by Sancho's ""penance"" (the beating of the wine skins). She gives Sancho six smocks.

Don Quixote reflects on the true nature of his chivalry. Sancho negotiates payment for his promised 3,300 lashes for Dulcinea's disenchantment (at half a real per lash). He attempts to inflict the lashes upon himself but strikes trees instead, groaning loudly. Don Quixote stops him, believing he has given over a thousand lashes. They stay at an inn, and Don Quixote, seemingly returning to sanity, recognizes it as an inn.

They meet Don Álvaro Tarfe, a character from the false ""Second Part"" of Don Quixote's history. Don Álvaro insists he met a different Don Quixote and Sancho. Don Quixote forces Don Álvaro to make a legal declaration before a magistrate that he has never met this Don Quixote before, thus refuting the false history. Sancho finishes his promised lashes on trees.

Upon entering their village, Don Quixote interprets two boys' quarrel and a fleeing hare as bad omens. He meets the curate and bachelor Samson Carrasco, who are surprised by Sancho's ""fiery robe"" and Dapple's mitre (from the duke's prank). Don Quixote, having been defeated by the Knight of the White Moon (the disguised Samson Carrasco), is now under a one-year prohibition from chivalry. He proposes they all become shepherds for a year. The curate and bachelor humor him, agreeing to the plan.

Don Quixote falls ill with a fever. His friends believe it is from dejection over his defeat. After six days, he awakens, fully sane, declaring himself Alonso Quixano the Good. He denounces books of chivalry as absurd and deceptive and expresses regret for his madness. Samson Carrasco tries to remind him of Dulcinea's disenchantment and their shepherd plan, but Don Quixote rejects it. He asks for a confessor and a notary to make his will. He leaves his property to his niece, Antonia Quixana, with the condition that she must not marry anyone who knows about books of chivalry. He also forgives Sancho all debts and, if he could, would give him a kingdom. He asks his executors to apologize to the author of the false ""Second Part.""

Don Quixote then dies peacefully in his bed, ""amid the tears and lamentations of all present."" The notary testifies that Alonso Quixano the Good died naturally, to prevent any further false histories. Samson Carrasco writes an epitaph: ""A crazy man his life he passed, But in his senses died at last."" The original author, Cid Hamete, concludes by stating his purpose was to bring the false tales of chivalry into detestation, and that his true Don Quixote is now dead and buried, making any further ""sallies"" impossible."
Dracula-Bram Stoker,"The narrative begins with Jonathan Harker, a newly qualified solicitor, traveling through Transylvania in May. He is on a business trip to finalize a London estate purchase for a client, Count Dracula. Along his journey, he observes local customs and superstitions, noting the fear of ""evil things"" on St. George's Eve, and is given a crucifix by a frightened old innkeeper. As he approaches Castle Dracula in a mysterious calèche driven by a powerful man with red, gleaming eyes, he overhears passengers using words like ""vampire"" and crossing themselves. Wolves howl around the carriage, and Jonathan sees the driver use a strange gesture to make them retreat.

Upon arriving at the ruined castle, Jonathan meets Count Dracula, an old man with an aquiline nose, sharp white teeth, pale pointed ears, and hair on his palms. The Count's handshake is cold and immensely strong. He welcomes Jonathan, speaks excellent English, but has a strange intonation. Jonathan observes the Count's unusual diet (never eating in his presence) and lack of reflection in mirrors. He realizes he is a prisoner in the castle, with all doors locked and the main exit key missing. He suspects the Count was his mysterious coachman.

Jonathan begins to record his terrifying experiences. He witnesses the Count crawling face-down like a lizard down the castle wall. He also experiences a night where three voluptuous women (vampires) appear and attempt to bite him, but the Count intervenes, claiming Jonathan as his own. The Count then throws a moving bag, which wails like a child, to the women, who disappear with it. Jonathan later finds the Count in a large box filled with earth in a ruined chapel within the castle, looking rejuvenated with blood on his lips. He attempts to kill the Count with a shovel, inflicting a gash on his forehead, but is paralyzed by the Count's blazing eyes.

The Count forces Jonathan to write three post-dated letters, creating a false timeline for his return to England. Jonathan attempts to send secret letters via gypsies, but the Count intercepts and burns one written in shorthand, calling it ""vile."" Jonathan realizes the Count is impersonating him, wearing his clothes, to establish a false trail in England. He later hears a woman's agonized cry in the courtyard, demanding her child, followed by the sound of wolves devouring something. Jonathan concludes the child is dead and the woman is better off. Desperate, Jonathan resolves to escape. He eventually jumps from the Count's window, scales the castle wall, and finds himself trapped by the Count, who, with wolves howling, refuses to let him leave until morning. The next morning, Jonathan escapes the castle, only to find the door locked behind him. He returns to the chapel, finding the Count in his earth-box, appearing gorged with blood. Jonathan strikes him again, but is again paralyzed by the Count's eyes. Hearing the approach of the Szgany and Slovaks, who nail the Count's box shut, Jonathan makes a final desperate escape attempt by scaling the castle wall, choosing death by precipice over staying with the ""awful women.""

Meanwhile, in England, Jonathan's fiancée, Mina Murray, and her friend, Lucy Westenra, exchange letters. Lucy receives three marriage proposals in one day from Dr. John Seward, Quincey Morris, and Arthur Holmwood (Lord Godalming), accepting Arthur's. Mina learns Jonathan is ill with brain fever in Buda-Pesth and is advised not to excite him. Lucy, while in Whitby, begins to sleepwalk. She is found by Mina on a cliff, having seen a dark figure with red eyes. Later, an old man, Mr. Swales, is found dead in the churchyard with a broken neck, and a dog shows terror near his grave. A Russian ship, the _Demeter_, carrying 50 boxes of earth, drifts into Whitby harbor with its dead captain lashed to the helm, a crucifix in his hand. An immense dog leaps from the ship and disappears. A local mastiff is later found dead with its throat torn. The captain's log reveals his crew disappeared one by one, hunted by a ""tall, thin man"" who was impervious to a knife, leading the mate to jump overboard.

Lucy's health deteriorates rapidly, marked by extreme pallor, weakness, and two small, unhealing punctures on her throat. Dr. Seward, Lucy's rejected suitor, consults his former master, Professor Van Helsing, a specialist in obscure diseases. Van Helsing arrives and immediately identifies the problem as a severe loss of blood. Arthur, Seward, Van Helsing, and later Quincey, perform multiple blood transfusions to save Lucy, but her condition is precarious. Van Helsing discovers the throat wounds and suspects a supernatural cause. Lucy's mother, unaware of the true danger, removes the protective garlic flowers Van Helsing placed in Lucy's room, leading to a severe relapse. Lucy's mother dies from shock.

During this time, Dr. Seward's patient, Renfield, a ""zoöphagous maniac"" who consumes living creatures to absorb their life force, exhibits erratic behavior, seemingly linked to the Count's presence. He escapes the asylum twice, running to the deserted Carfax house next door, speaking of a ""Master"" and awaiting rewards. He attacks carriers delivering boxes to Carfax, shouting, ""I'll fight for my Lord and Master!""

Lucy eventually dies. Van Helsing reveals she is ""Un-Dead."" He explains that the creature who killed her is a vampire, and she too has become one, preying on children (the ""bloofer lady"" of Hampstead). He convinces Arthur, Seward, and Quincey of the terrible truth. Together, they go to Lucy's tomb. They find it empty, but later, Lucy, as an Un-Dead creature, appears, holding a child she has fed upon. She attempts to lure Arthur, her fiancé, but recoils from Van Helsing's crucifix. The men witness her corporeal body pass through a narrow space into the tomb.
That night, with Arthur's consent, they return to the tomb. Arthur, with immense grief and courage, drives a stake through Lucy's heart. Her body writhes and screams, then falls still, and she is restored to her former beauty. Van Helsing then decapitates her, fills her mouth with garlic, and seals the coffin, freeing her soul. The men pledge to hunt and destroy the author of their sorrow.

Mina, now married to Jonathan, learns of his Transylvanian ordeal from his journal. She begins to transcribe all the diaries and letters, creating a complete chronological record. Jonathan, initially traumatized, is strengthened by the knowledge and by Mina's support. Mina, in London, encounters the Count, who has grown younger. She realizes the Count has moved into a house in Piccadilly. Dr. Seward's patient, Renfield, reveals that the Count visited him and promised him ""lives"" (rats, dogs, cats) in exchange for his service. Renfield, realizing the Count has been feeding on Mina, attempts to fight him but is mortally wounded. Before dying, Renfield exposes the Count's recent actions, including a forced blood exchange with Mina, which has cursed her.

The men confront the Count in Piccadilly. He has burned his papers and destroyed Seward's phonograph cylinders. Jonathan wounds the Count with his Kukri knife, cutting his coat and revealing money. The Count, though wounded, escapes by leaping from a window and securing himself in a stable. He boasts of his revenge and claims Mina and others will become his ""creatures."" The men realize the Count has only one earth-box left. Van Helsing seals the Carfax and Piccadilly lairs with Sacred Wafer, preventing the Count from using them.

They deduce the Count's escape route: by ship from London to Galatz, and then up the Danube to his castle in Transylvania. Mina, under hypnosis, confirms the Count's location on a ship. They decide to pursue him. Mina reveals that the Count, in his selfishness, severed his mental connection to her, inadvertently freeing her to use her hypnotic connection to track him. Van Helsing reveals the Count's true identity as Voivode Dracula, a powerful historical figure, a ""criminal"" whose past habits reveal his predictable escape route back to his castle.

Jonathan, Lord Godalming, Dr. Seward, and Quincey Morris journey to Varna, then to Galatz. Mina, despite the danger, insists on accompanying Van Helsing to the Borgo Pass. They sterilize the remaining earth-boxes.
The team converges near Dracula's castle. Mina, hypnotized, tracks the Count's progress upriver. Van Helsing, with Mina, travels overland to the Borgo Pass, following Jonathan's old route. At the castle, Van Helsing finds and destroys the three vampire women Jonathan had seen, whose bodies crumble to dust when staked. He also lays Sacred Wafer in Dracula's tomb to banish him forever from it.

As sunset approaches, the pursuers close in on the Szgany, who are transporting the Count's last earth-box in a leiter-wagon towards the castle. Jonathan, Godalming, Seward, and Morris intercept them. Jonathan and Quincey fight their way to the cart. Jonathan throws the box to the ground. Quincey is fatally wounded by a gypsy's knife. They open the box and find the Count inside. As the sun sets, Jonathan Harker's Kukri knife slices through the Count's throat, and Quincey Morris's bowie knife plunges into his heart. The Count's body crumbles into dust. Quincey Morris dies, but his last words confirm that the curse has passed from Mina, and her forehead is ""stainless."" The Castle of Dracula stands against the red sky."
Frankenstein-Mary Shelley,"Here is a very detailed summary of the plot of the provided text, strictly adhering to the events and information contained within it:

The narrative begins with a series of letters from Robert Walton, an English explorer on an Arctic voyage of discovery, addressed to his sister, Mrs. Saville, in England.

**Walton's Letters:**
Walton writes from St. Petersburgh, then Archangel, detailing his ambitious plans to discover a passage near the North Pole, ascertain the secret of the magnet, and explore unknown lands. He expresses his ardent curiosity and desire for glory, acknowledging his sister's forebodings but confident in his success. He also laments his lack of a true friend with whom to share his intellectual pursuits and emotions. He praises his lieutenant for courage and enterprise, and his master for gentleness and integrity, recounting a romantic story of the master's self-sacrificing love for a woman who loved another. Walton asserts his resolutions are fixed despite his complaints, and he anticipates sailing soon.

Later, in July, Walton writes that he is well advanced on his voyage, having reached a high latitude. His men are bold, and they are making good progress, though floating ice indicates danger. He reaffirms his determination for success.

In August, a strange incident occurs. His ship becomes surrounded by ice and thick fog. When the mist clears, they spot a gigantic, human-shaped figure guiding a dog-drawn sledge across the ice towards the north. Two hours later, the ice breaks, freeing the ship. The next morning, they discover another sledge, drifted towards them on a large ice fragment, containing a European man (Victor Frankenstein), nearly frozen and emaciated, with only one dog remaining alive. Frankenstein insists on knowing their destination before coming aboard. Upon hearing they are bound for the northern pole, he agrees to enter the vessel.

Frankenstein is slowly nursed back to health by Walton. He is generally melancholy, but moments of kindness reveal a benevolent and sweet aspect to his otherwise wild and despairing eyes. When asked why he traveled so far on the ice, Frankenstein replies, ""To seek one who fled from me."" When told of the gigantic figure seen earlier, Frankenstein becomes agitated, asking many questions about the ""dæmon's"" route. He grows eager to watch for the sledge, though Walton persuades him to stay in the cabin due to his weakness.

Walton's affection for Frankenstein grows daily. He finds him gentle, wise, and cultivated. Frankenstein, recovering, observes Walton's own ambitious plans for discovery. Walton, speaking with fervent ardor, expresses his willingness to sacrifice everything for the advancement of his enterprise. This causes a ""dark gloom"" to spread over Frankenstein's countenance; he weeps and groans, then warns Walton, ""Unhappy man! Do you share my madness? Have you drunk also of the intoxicating draught? Hear me; let me reveal my tale, and you will dash the cup from your lips!"" After recovering from his grief, Frankenstein asks about Walton's desire for a friend, agreeing that ""we are unfashioned creatures, but half made up"" without such aid. He states he once had a noble friend but has lost everything.

Frankenstein eventually agrees to narrate his story to Walton, seeing Walton's pursuit of knowledge mirroring his own and hoping his tale will offer a moral lesson to guide or console him. Walton resolves to record Frankenstein's story as accurately as possible.

**Frankenstein's Narrative:**

**Chapter 1:**
Victor Frankenstein, a Genevese from a distinguished family, recounts his parents' history. His father, Alphonse Frankenstein, a respected public servant, married late in life. His wife, Caroline Beaufort, was the daughter of Alphonse's close friend, Beaufort, a merchant who fell into poverty. Beaufort, proud, retreated to Lucerne where he died in his daughter's arms after a long illness. Alphonse, finding Caroline attending her dying father, rescued her, and two years later, married her. Victor was their first child, born in Naples, and cherished. Five years later, while in Italy, his mother discovered Elizabeth Lavenza, a beautiful orphan child of a Milanese nobleman and a German mother, being raised by poor peasants. Caroline, remembering her own rescue, persuaded the peasants to let Elizabeth live with them. Elizabeth became Victor's adopted ""more than sister,"" a beloved companion. Victor, in childish seriousness, viewed Elizabeth as his ""possession"" to protect and cherish.

**Chapter 2:**
Victor and Elizabeth grew up together. Victor was intensely curious about the hidden laws of nature, while Elizabeth found delight in poetry and nature's scenes. Henry Clerval, son of a Geneva merchant, became Victor's closest friend, sharing a love for chivalry and adventure. Victor describes his happy childhood but notes a ""fatal impulse"" from his early scientific pursuits. At thirteen, he discovered the works of Cornelius Agrippa, Paracelsus, and Albertus Magnus, becoming engrossed in alchemy despite his father dismissing it as ""sad trash."" This early ""exploded system"" of science fascinated him until, at fifteen, a violent thunderstorm destroyed an oak tree, and a philosopher's explanation of electricity and galvanism made him despise his former studies. He turned to mathematics, but ""Destiny was too potent.""

**Chapter 3:**
At seventeen, Victor's parents decide he should attend Ingolstadt University. Before he leaves, Elizabeth contracts scarlet fever. His mother nurses her, saving Elizabeth but falling ill herself and dying. On her deathbed, she expresses her hope for Victor and Elizabeth's union. Victor's departure is delayed by grief. Elizabeth, though sorrowful, acts as a comforter to the family. Clerval, who wished to accompany Victor to university, is prevented by his merchant father, who sees no value in a liberal education. Victor travels to Ingolstadt, feeling solitary. He meets M. Krempe, a gruff natural philosophy professor, who scolds him for studying alchemists and tells him to start anew. Victor is initially disinclined to modern science, but then meets M. Waldman, a chemistry professor. Waldman praises the powers of modern chemistry, inspiring Victor to dedicate himself to the science.

**Chapter 4:**
Victor pursues natural philosophy and chemistry with ardour, surpassing his professors. After two years without visiting Geneva, he makes discoveries in chemical instruments. He then becomes deeply interested in the ""principle of life."" To understand life, he studies death, spending days and nights in vaults and charnel-houses, examining decay. He discovers the ""cause of generation and life"" and gains the ability to animate lifeless matter. Overwhelmed by this power, he decides to create a human-like being. Due to the difficulty of working with minute parts, he resolves to make the creature of gigantic stature (about eight feet tall). He spends months collecting materials, consumed by his work, neglecting his health and friends, driven by a desire to create a ""new species."" His health deteriorates, and he becomes nervous and isolated.

**Chapter 5:**
On a ""dreary night of November,"" Victor brings his creation to life. The creature's ""dull yellow eye"" opens, it breathes and moves. Victor is instantly filled with horror and disgust at its hideous appearance, despite having chosen its features to be beautiful. He flees the room. He dreams of Elizabeth, who transforms into his dead mother's corpse. He awakens to find the creature standing over his bed, reaching out. Victor escapes the house, spending the night in the courtyard. The next morning, he wanders the streets until he encounters Henry Clerval, who has arrived in Ingolstadt. Victor is overjoyed, momentarily forgetting his horror. Clerval notices Victor's extreme illness. Victor rushes back to his apartment, finds the creature gone, and is relieved. He then collapses into a ""nervous fever"" for several months. Clerval nurses him, concealing the severity of his illness from his family. Victor raves incessantly about ""the monster.""

**Chapter 6:**
Victor slowly recovers in spring, his spirits reviving. Clerval gives him a letter from Elizabeth, expressing concern over his long silence and detailing family news. Ernest, Victor's younger brother, is sixteen and wants to join foreign service. Justine Moritz, a girl taken in by the Frankenstein family after her own mother's unkindness and family deaths, has returned to their household after her mother's death. Victor immediately writes back. He tries to introduce Clerval to the university professors but finds their praise of his scientific progress torturous, as he now despises natural philosophy. Clerval, discerning Victor's distress, diverts conversation and focuses on his own studies of oriental languages, which Victor joins to escape his thoughts. This period of study and a pedestrian tour with Clerval through the Ingolstadt environs helps Victor recover his health and spirits.

**Chapter 7:**
Victor receives a letter from his father, informing him of the murder of his youngest brother, William. William, Elizabeth, and Ernest had been walking in Plainpalais; William went to hide and was found strangled the next morning with finger marks on his neck. Elizabeth, who had given William a miniature of Victor's mother to wear, blames herself, as the picture is missing and believed to be the murderer's motive. Victor is urged to return home to console his grieving family. On his journey to Geneva, Victor is overcome with fear. Arriving at night, the city gates are shut, so he stays in a village called Secheron. He visits the murder scene at Plainpalais during a thunderstorm. During a lightning flash, he sees a gigantic figure, which he instantly recognizes as the creature he created. He deduces the creature is William's murderer but resolves to keep silent, fearing he would be deemed mad and the monster untraceable. At home, he learns from Ernest that Justine Moritz has been accused of the murder. A servant found the missing miniature in Justine's pocket. Justine's confused behavior confirmed suspicion. Victor is convinced of Justine's innocence, knowing the true murderer, as is Elizabeth.

**Chapter 8:**
Victor attends Justine's trial, suffering immense guilt and torture, believing himself the true cause of William's death and Justine's impending fate. Justine appears calm, confident in her innocence, but the witnesses' testimony is against her: she was seen near the body, gave confused answers, and had the miniature found in her pocket. Elizabeth tearfully testifies to Justine's good character and innocence, but public indignation is strong. Victor, believing the monster guilty, rushes out in agony. Justine is condemned. Victor learns that Justine confessed her guilt under duress from her confessor, who threatened her with excommunication and hellfire. Elizabeth and Victor visit her in prison. Justine reaffirms her innocence, explaining her coerced confession. She is resigned to her fate. Victor is tormented by remorse, calling himself the ""true murderer."" Justine is executed the next day. Victor reflects on his profound guilt and the desolation of his family.

**Chapter 9:**
Victor is consumed by despair and remorse, shunning human company. His father tries to console him, urging him to overcome his grief, but Victor cannot, as remorse and terror are intertwined with his sorrow. He retreats to their house at Belrive, spending hours alone on the lake, contemplating suicide but restrained by thoughts of Elizabeth, his father, and Ernest, whom he fears leaving vulnerable to the monster. He nurtures an intense hatred for the creature, wishing to destroy the life he so carelessly bestowed. Elizabeth is also deeply affected, seeing human goodness tainted by the injustice of Justine's death. Victor, driven by his torment, leaves home and seeks solace in the magnificence of the Alpine valleys, heading for Chamounix.

**Chapter 10:**
In Chamounix, Victor finds some temporary consolation in the sublime natural scenery, which elevates and tranquilizes his mind. The next morning, feeling dark melancholy, he resolves to ascend Montanvert to view the glacier, hoping its majesty will distract him. At the summit, overlooking the ""sea of ice,"" he suddenly sees the gigantic figure of the creature approaching with ""superhuman speed."" Filled with rage and horror, Victor confronts him, calling him ""Devil"" and accusing him of William and Justine's murders, wishing to ""trample [him] to dust."" The creature responds calmly, reminding Victor that he is his creator and demanding Victor fulfill his duties, threatening to harm Victor's remaining friends if he refuses. Victor attempts to attack, but the creature easily evades him. The creature implores Victor to listen to his tale, arguing that misery made him a fiend, and promising to be virtuous if Victor creates a companion for him. Victor initially refuses but is intrigued by curiosity and a growing sense of duty as creator. He agrees to listen to the creature's story, hoping to confirm his suspicions about William's murder. They enter a hut, and the creature begins his narrative.

**Chapter 11:**
The creature recounts his earliest memories: a confused awakening of sensations. He learned to distinguish sights, sounds, and feelings. He was oppressed by light and cold, finding shelter in a forest near Ingolstadt. He suffered hunger and thirst, discovering berries and a brook for sustenance. One night, he found a huge cloak. He discovered fire left by beggars, learning its warmth but also pain, and eventually how to manage it for heat and cooking. Food became scarce, so he migrated, lamenting the loss of fire. He stumbled upon open country covered in snow and found a small hut. An old shepherd living there shrieked and fled upon seeing him. The creature devoured the shepherd's breakfast (bread, cheese, milk, wine) and slept. He continued traveling, encountered a village, and upon trying to enter a cottage, was attacked by shrieking children and villagers, forcing him to flee to a low hovel attached to another cottage. He settled in this hovel, observing the cottagers through a chink in the wall. He saw a young woman (Agatha) and a young man (Felix) working, and an old blind man playing music. Their gentle manners and sadness deeply moved him, prompting a mixture of pain and pleasure he had never felt before.

**Chapter 12:**
The creature continued to observe the cottagers, longing to join them but fearing rejection. He realized the old man was blind and the family was suffering from poverty. They often went without food to feed the old man. Moved by their kindness, the creature stopped stealing their food and instead secretly gathered wood for them at night. The cottagers were astonished by the ""good spirit"" who helped them. He also discovered their articulate language and ardently desired to learn it. After months of intense observation, he learned common words and the names of the cottagers (father, Agatha, Felix). He was delighted to understand these sounds. He sympathized with their emotions. He then saw his own reflection in a pool and was horrified by his hideous deformity, filling him with ""despondence and mortification."" He resolved to master their language before revealing himself, hoping his gentle demeanor could overcome his appearance.

**Chapter 13:**
As spring advanced, the creature continued his studies of language while observing the cottagers. A beautiful veiled lady arrived on horseback, greeted by an ecstatic Felix, who called her his ""sweet Arabian"" (Safie). Safie spoke a different language but began learning the cottagers' tongue, which the creature also utilized to accelerate his own learning. From a book Felix used to teach Safie, Volney's *Ruins of Empires*, the creature gained knowledge of history, empires, governments, and the complexities of human society, including wealth, poverty, rank, and justice. This knowledge brought him immense sorrow, as he realized he possessed none of the valued human attributes (money, friends, property) and was hideously deformed, making him an ""outcast."" He compared himself to Adam in *Paradise Lost* but found himself more like Satan, alone and abhorred. He also discovered Victor's journal, which detailed his own creation, Victor's horror, and his ""odious and loathsome person,"" confirming his monstrous nature and deepening his despair. He cursed his creator. Still, he harbored hope that the benevolent cottagers might accept him if he proved his virtuous admiration and gentle disposition, especially through the blind De Lacey. He resolved to introduce himself to the old man first.

**Chapter 14:**
The creature then recounts the history of the De Lacey family. De Lacey, a former French nobleman, Felix, his son, and Agatha, his daughter, had been exiled from Paris. Felix had helped Safie's father, a Turkish merchant, escape unjust imprisonment and a death sentence in France, driven by indignation at the injustice and his burgeoning love for Safie. Safie's Christian Arab mother had instilled in her a desire for independence, making her despise the prospect of returning to a Turkish harem. The Turk had promised Safie's hand to Felix, but after his escape and learning of Felix's subsequent ruin (Felix was imprisoned for five months, then exiled with his family, losing their fortune, for his role in the escape), the treacherous Turk abandoned Felix and tried to force Safie to return to Turkey. Safie, learning of Felix's exile and location, fled with jewels and an attendant, overcoming the attendant's death and language barriers to find the De Laceys in Germany. This story deepens the creature's admiration for the cottagers' virtues and his understanding of human vice.

**Chapter 15:**
(This appears to be a misnumbering in the provided text as the previous chapter was 14. This content seems to be a continuation of the creature's education and reflection. I will summarize it as it stands in the text.)
The creature describes finding a portmanteau containing clothes and books, including *Paradise Lost*, *Plutarch's Lives*, and *The Sorrows of Werter*. These books profoundly affect him. *Werter* introduces him to human passions and suffering, while *Plutarch* teaches him about ancient heroes and the complexities of human society, including war and governance. *Paradise Lost* makes him feel like Adam, alone and without connection, but more often like Satan, consumed by envy and bitterness as he observes the bliss of others. He also reads Victor's journal, which explicitly details his creation and Victor's immediate horror and disgust at his appearance, confirming his ""accursed origin"" and monstrousness. This knowledge fills him with agony, and he curses his creator. He realizes his deformed figure is the cause of human horror but still hopes to gain the sympathy of the cottagers by revealing his virtues. He resolves to approach the blind De Lacey first, believing his blindness would allow him to be heard without immediate revulsion.

**Chapter 16:**
One day, when the younger cottagers (Safie, Agatha, Felix) are away, the creature enters the cottage and speaks with the blind De Lacey. He presents himself as an unfortunate traveler seeking kindness. De Lacey, unable to see his appearance, is welcoming and sympathetic, offering to help him find friends. The creature then reveals that De Lacey and his family are the ""friends"" he seeks, begging for their protection. At that moment, Felix, Safie, and Agatha return. Horrified, Agatha faints, Safie flees, and Felix violently attacks the creature, driving him from the cottage. The creature, heartbroken and enraged, curses Victor and declares ""everlasting war against the species."" He hides in the woods, giving vent to ""fearful howlings."" When he later returns to the cottage, he finds it deserted; Felix had decided they could never inhabit it again due to the dreadful incident. In a fit of rage, the creature burns the cottage to the ground. He resolves to seek out Victor in Geneva, having learned his creator's native town from the journal. During his journey south, he saves a young girl from drowning but is shot in the shoulder by her male companion who sees his appearance, confirming his hatred for mankind. Near Geneva, he encounters Victor's young brother, William. He attempts to befriend William, hoping the child is unprejudiced, but William screams, calls him a ""monster,"" and reveals he is a Frankenstein. Enraged, the creature strangles William. Exulting in his revenge, he takes a miniature from William's neck and plants it on a sleeping Justine Moritz to frame her for the murder. He then demands Victor create a female companion for him.

**Chapter 17:**
The creature demands Victor create a female companion for him, arguing that his malice stems from his misery and isolation. He promises that if Victor complies, he and his companion will quit human society forever and live harmlessly in the ""vast wilds of South America."" Victor initially refuses, fearing the potential for increased wickedness and a ""race of devils."" The creature argues that he is malicious only because he is miserable, and with a companion, he would find sympathy and become virtuous. He passionately swears to leave Europe and dwell in savage places if his request is granted. Victor, though repulsed by the creature's form, is moved by his arguments and a sense of duty as his creator. He agrees to create a female, on the condition that the creature takes a solemn oath to quit Europe and human society forever with his new mate. The creature swears and departs, stating he will watch Victor's progress and appear when ready. Victor, burdened by this promise, returns to Geneva.

**Chapter 18:**
Back in Geneva, Victor delays commencing his new work, feeling intense repugnance. His health improves, and his father, noting his lingering melancholy, suggests that Victor might not truly love Elizabeth and offers to release him from their engagement if he loves another. Victor reassures his father of his love for Elizabeth and his desire for their union. His father then proposes an immediate marriage. Victor, however, feels bound by his promise to the creature and realizes he must fulfill it first. He decides to travel to England to gather information and materials, and to perform his ""loathsome task"" in solitude away from his family. His father, pleased Victor is taking an interest in travel, arranges for Henry Clerval to accompany him to Strasburgh. Victor believes Clerval's presence will protect him from the monster's potential intrusions and provide distraction. They travel down the Rhine, Clerval enjoying the scenery, while Victor remains consumed by gloomy thoughts. They arrive in London.

**Chapter 19:**
Victor and Clerval spend several months in London. Victor, solely focused on his ""abhorred task,"" seeks information from natural philosophers, while Clerval pursues his own interests in oriental languages and trade, hoping to visit India. Victor is tormented by the memories of William and Justine and feels alienated from humanity. He begins secretly collecting materials for the female creature, an agonizing process. They receive an invitation to Scotland, which Clerval eagerly accepts. Victor agrees, planning to complete his work in a remote part of the Scottish highlands. They travel through England, visiting Windsor, Oxford, and the Cumberland lakes. Victor remains despondent, haunted by his past and future. At Perth, Victor tells Clerval he wishes to travel alone for a month or two to find ""peace and solitude."" Clerval reluctantly agrees. Victor then travels to one of the remotest Orkney Islands, rents a dilapidated hut, and begins his work. He finds the second creation even more horrible than the first, working in ""cold blood"" and often sickened by his hands. He constantly fears the monster will appear to claim his companion.

**Chapter 20:**
One evening, while working on the female creature, Victor reflects deeply on the potential consequences: the female might be more evil, refuse the compact, hate her mate, or they might reproduce a ""race of devils"" that would endanger mankind. He realizes he would be condemning future generations for his own peace. At that moment, he looks up and sees the monster at his window, grinning. Enraged by the monster's malice and treachery, and the full weight of his promise's wickedness, Victor tears the half-finished female creature to pieces. The monster howls in ""devilish despair and revenge"" and withdraws. Victor vows never to resume his labors. Later, the monster enters Victor's room, confronting him. He recounts his long, painful journey, following Victor across Europe, and accuses Victor of breaking his promise. Victor defiantly refuses to create a companion. The monster, full of rage, threatens Victor, stating he will make his life miserable and declares, ""I will be with you on your wedding-night."" He then flees in a boat. Victor interprets this threat as the monster intending to murder *him* on his wedding night, which he faces without fear for himself, but fears for Elizabeth. He receives letters from Clerval, urging him to meet in Perth. Victor decides to leave the island in two days, first disposing of the remains of the female creature and his instruments in the sea. A storm then drives his boat far out into the Atlantic. He endures thirst and fear, believing his death is imminent. He eventually sights land and lands in an Irish town, where he is met with hostility and arrested for a murder that took place the previous night.

**Chapter 21:**
Victor is brought before Mr. Kirwin, a magistrate. Witnesses depose that a young man was found strangled with finger marks on his neck, and a boat matching Victor's was seen near the shore. Victor, horrified, recognizes the mode of murder and is intensely agitated. He is then led to the room where the body lies and discovers it is Henry Clerval. Overcome with agony, Victor cries out, admitting he has destroyed William, Justine, and now Henry. He collapses in convulsions and falls into a fever, lasting two months. During his delirium, he raves about being the murderer of William, Justine, and Clerval, and of the fiend tormenting him. Mr. Kirwin, who understands French, hears these ravings. Victor recovers in prison, remembering everything. Mr. Kirwin shows him kindness, providing a doctor and nurse, and reveals he read Victor's papers and wrote to his family. Victor's father arrives, comforting him. Victor slowly regains health but is consumed by melancholy. The grand jury ultimately rejects the murder charge against Victor after it's proven he was on the Orkney Islands at the time of Clerval's death, and he is liberated. Victor feels no joy in freedom, haunted by the monster's eyes. His father tries to console him, but Victor is only roused by the thought of revenge against the monster. He resolves to return to Geneva to protect his remaining family and destroy the fiend. They sail for Havre-de-Grace. Victor reflects on his life, his creation, and the deaths he caused, taking laudanum to sleep, but still experiencing nightmares of the monster.

**Chapter 22:**
Victor and his father travel to Paris and then Geneva. Victor remains ill and avoids society, convinced he has unchained a murderer among mankind. He confesses to his father, stating, ""William, Justine, and Henry—they all died by my hands."" His father, believing he is delirious, dismisses these statements. Victor suppresses his secret to avoid being thought mad. He receives a letter from Elizabeth, expressing concern for his happiness and asking if he truly loves her or feels bound by honor, offering to release him if he loves another. Victor remembers the monster's threat, ""I shall be with you on your wedding-night,"" and believes it portends his own death. He decides not to postpone the marriage, fearing the monster might take even more dreadful revenge if provoked. He writes to Elizabeth, assuring her of his love and promising to reveal a ""dreadful secret"" the day after their marriage, urging her not to mention it until then. They return to Geneva; Elizabeth is changed, thinner, but still gentle. Victor's father presses for an immediate marriage, and Victor agrees to a ceremony in ten days, believing he is sealing his own death. He realizes too late that he might be hastening Elizabeth's death instead. Preparations are made, and Victor, outwardly cheerful but inwardly terrified, carries pistols and a dagger, constantly watchful. They decide to spend their first days of marriage at Villa Lavenza on Lake Como. On their wedding day, Elizabeth is melancholy, sensing evil.

**Chapter 23:**
Victor and Elizabeth travel by boat to Evian, enjoying the scenery, though Victor is consumed by foreboding. They land at eight in the evening and retire to the inn. A violent storm rises. Victor, pistol in hand, is agitated and watchful, expecting a confrontation. Elizabeth, terrified by his demeanor, asks what he fears. Victor reassures her that ""this night, and all will be safe,"" but admits the night is ""dreadful, very dreadful."" He persuades her to retire while he searches for the enemy. He inspects the house but finds no trace. Suddenly, he hears a ""shrill and dreadful scream"" from Elizabeth's room. He rushes in to find Elizabeth lifeless on the bed, strangled. He looks up and sees the monster at the open window, grinning and pointing at Elizabeth's corpse. Victor fires a pistol, but the monster leaps out and plunges into the lake, escaping. A crowd enters; they search in vain for the monster. Victor collapses in exhaustion and fever. Upon recovering, he realizes his father and Ernest are still vulnerable. He resolves to return to Geneva immediately. He travels by boat. In Geneva, his father, upon hearing the news of Elizabeth's death, collapses and dies a few days later in Victor's arms. Victor loses sensation, is imprisoned, and believed to be mad, spending months in a solitary cell. He eventually recovers, driven by an insatiable desire for revenge. He approaches a criminal judge, relates his extraordinary story, and demands the monster's apprehension and punishment. The magistrate, though initially incredulous and convinced Victor is delirious, is intimidated by Victor's rage and promises to exert himself, but doubts the practicality of pursuing such a creature. Victor, furious at the magistrate's disbelief, leaves, resolving to pursue the monster himself.

**Chapter 24:**
Victor, consumed by fury and revenge, leaves Geneva forever, equipped with money and jewels. He wanders, visiting the graves of William, Elizabeth, and his father. He kneels and swears an oath of vengeance, vowing to pursue the ""dæmon"" until one of them perishes. He hears a ""fiendish laugh"" and the monster's voice, ""I am satisfied, miserable wretch! You have determined to live, and I am satisfied."" He sees the monster flee. Victor then dedicates himself to a relentless pursuit, following the monster for many months across vast portions of the earth, including the Rhone, the Mediterranean, the Black Sea, Tartary, and Russia, guided by clues left by the monster himself (who fears Victor might die if he loses track). Victor endures extreme cold, hunger, and fatigue, sometimes feeling a supernatural aid, and sometimes dreaming of his lost loved ones. The monster leaves taunting inscriptions, challenging Victor to follow him to the ""everlasting ices of the north."" Victor procures a sledge and dogs, gaining on the monster. He reaches a hamlet on the seashore, learning that the monster had passed through, stealing provisions and taking a sledge and dogs to travel across the frozen sea. Victor, filled with renewed rage, equips himself for Arctic pursuit. He endures immense hardships among mountains of ice. After three weeks, he sights the monster's sledge in the distance and gains on him. However, a ""ground sea"" breaks the ice, separating them. Victor is left drifting on a diminishing ice raft. He eventually sights Walton's vessel, uses parts of his sledge to construct oars, and reaches the ship, still intent on his pursuit. He tells Walton that his task is unfulfilled and begs Walton to swear to destroy the monster if he dies. He warns Walton not to trust the monster's eloquence, urging him to avenge his family.

**Walton, in continuation (Conclusion):**
Walton notes Frankenstein's declining health and the harrowing nature of his story. Frankenstein corrects and augments Walton's notes of his narrative. Walton is deeply affected by Frankenstein's suffering but finds his guest resistant to any hope for life, clinging only to the purpose of vengeance. He observes that Frankenstein believes his dreams of his dead friends are real visitations. Walton's ship is still trapped in ice, and many crew members are dying from the cold. The sailors demand Walton promise to turn the ship south if a passage opens. Frankenstein, despite his extreme weakness, delivers an impassioned speech, urging the men to continue the glorious expedition and not yield to fear. The sailors are momentarily moved, but Walton eventually yields to their demands and promises to return south if released from the ice. The ice then breaks, and a passage to the south opens, bringing tumultuous joy to the sailors. Frankenstein, upon learning they are returning, is distraught and attempts to spring from his bed, but collapses, reaffirming his Heaven-assigned purpose of vengeance. He is close to death.

On his deathbed, Frankenstein tells Walton that his hatred has subsided, but he still feels justified in desiring the monster's death. He believes his duty to humankind outweighed his duty to his creation, justifying his refusal to create a companion for the monster. He renews his request for Walton to destroy the fiend but acknowledges he cannot force him to do so. He advises Walton to seek happiness in tranquility and avoid ambition in science. Frankenstein then dies peacefully, a gentle smile on his lips.

Later that night, Walton hears a sound from Frankenstein's cabin and enters. He finds the gigantic monster hanging over Frankenstein's coffin. The monster expresses remorse, calling Frankenstein his ""victim"" and his ""last victim,"" acknowledging his crimes are ""consummated."" Walton, initially driven by Frankenstein's dying request, feels a mixture of curiosity and compassion. He confronts the monster, calling his repentance superfluous. The monster explains his own remorse and suffering after Clerval's murder, but states that Victor's pursuit of happiness while he was miserable fueled his ""insatiable thirst for vengeance,"" driving him to destroy Elizabeth. He admits that ""evil thenceforth became my good."" He acknowledges his crimes and expresses profound self-loathing, calling himself an ""abortion"" and a ""malignant devil."" He denies seeking sympathy for his misery, stating that virtue and happiness have turned into ""bitter and loathing despair"" for him. He vows his ""work is nearly complete"" and that his own death is needed to conclude his being. He intends to quit the vessel on his ice raft, travel to the northernmost extremity, build a funeral pyre, and consume his body to prevent any other ""unhallowed wretch"" from creating another like him. He hopes to find peace in death. With a final farewell, he springs from the cabin window onto the ice raft and is borne away into darkness and distance."

**Chapter I**
The narrator introduces himself as Pip, a shortening of his Christian name Philip and his family name Pirrip. He is an orphan, having never known his parents, Philip and Georgiana Pirrip, who are buried in the local churchyard along with five of his infant brothers. Pip's earliest impressions of his parents are derived from their tombstones, imagining his father as a ""square, stout, dark man, with curly black hair"" and his mother as ""freckled and sickly."" He lives in the marsh country, near the river, about twenty miles from the sea, and is raised by his older sister, Mrs. Joe Gargery, who is married to Joe Gargery, the blacksmith.

One raw afternoon, while Pip is visiting the churchyard, a fearful man emerges from among the graves. This man, a convict dressed in coarse grey with a great iron on his leg, threatens Pip with violence, demanding to know his name and where he lives. Pip, terrified, identifies himself and points towards his village. The convict then turns Pip upside down, emptying his pockets of a piece of bread, which he devours. He further threatens Pip, ordering him to bring a file and ""wittles"" (food) to him at the old Battery on the marshes early the next morning, or face dire consequences, specifically having his ""heart and liver out."" The convict adds to Pip's terror by claiming he is not alone, and that a ""young man hid with me,"" who is even more dangerous, will find and harm Pip if he fails. Pip, in mortal fear, promises to comply. The convict releases him, limping towards the low church wall and then towards a distant gibbet. Pip, looking for the mysterious young man, sees no one and runs home.

**Chapter II**
Pip's sister, Mrs. Joe Gargery, is described as more than twenty years older, not good-looking, and known for raising Pip ""by hand,"" which in practice means she frequently hits both Pip and her husband Joe. She is tall, bony, has black hair and eyes, and a ""prevailing redness of skin,"" and constantly wears a coarse apron ""stuck full of pins and needles."" Joe Gargery, the blacksmith, is a mild, good-natured, and somewhat foolish man.

Pip arrives home from the churchyard to find Joe alone in the kitchen. Joe confides that Mrs. Joe has been out looking for Pip and is now out again, armed with ""Tickler,"" a wax-ended cane. Mrs. Joe soon returns, finds Pip hiding, and uses Tickler on him before throwing him at Joe. She scolds Pip for his absence, reminding him of her sacrifices in raising him. Pip's mind, however, is preoccupied with the convict, the young man, the file, the food, and his dreadful promise to commit larceny from his own home.

During dinner, Pip, despite being hungry, secretly puts his slice of bread and butter down his trouser leg to save for the convict. Joe notices Pip isn't eating, but Mrs. Joe misinterprets this as Pip having ""bolted his food,"" leading her to physically punish Joe. She then forces Pip to drink a large amount of unpleasant ""Tar-water"" as a ""restorative,"" and makes Joe drink some too. Pip's conscience is greatly troubled by the thought of robbing his sister and the impending danger from the convicts.

It is Christmas Eve. While stirring the pudding, Pip realizes the bread and butter in his trousers is problematic and hides it in his garret bedroom. He hears cannon fire and learns from Joe and Mrs. Joe that it signals escaped convicts from ""the Hulks"" (prison-ships). Mrs. Joe, annoyed by Pip's questions, tells him people are sent to the Hulks for bad deeds, and they ""always begin by asking questions."" Pip, terrified, feels he is destined for the Hulks and resolves to rob the pantry at dawn.

Before dawn, Pip steals bread, cheese, mincemeat, brandy (which he secretly dilutes with water in the original bottle), a meat bone, and a pork pie. He also takes a file from Joe’s forge. He then sets out for the misty marshes.

**Chapter III**
On the damp, misty morning, Pip walks towards the Battery, feeling as though the landscape itself is accusing him of theft. Lost in the fog, he encounters a man sleeping. Upon touching him, the man awakens, and Pip realizes it is not the first convict, but a different man, also dressed in coarse grey with a leg-iron, who swears at Pip, clumsily tries to hit him, and then flees into the mist. Pip identifies this as the ""young man"" the first convict had spoken of.

Pip soon reaches the Battery and finds the first convict, shivering and hungry. Pip hands over the file and the stolen food and brandy. The convict eats quickly, stopping to drink the brandy, which makes him shiver violently. He asks Pip if he brought anyone or told anyone to follow, which Pip denies. When the convict asks about the ""young man,"" Pip confirms he saw him ""yonder,"" asleep. The convict, realizing the cannon fire he heard last night was real, becomes enraged upon hearing the other man had a bruised face. He stuffs the remaining food into his jacket, demands Pip show him where the other man went, and begins filing at his own leg-iron, vowing to ""pull him down, like a bloodhound."" Pip, fearing the convict's ferocity, slips away and runs home.

**Chapter IV**
Pip expects to be apprehended for the theft, but Mrs. Joe is too busy preparing for Christmas dinner. She scolds Pip about his whereabouts, and Joe secretly signals to Pip that she is in a bad temper. Guests arrive for dinner: Mr. Wopsle, Mr. and Mrs. Hubble, and Uncle Pumblechook, who brings sherry and port. Pip is subjected to constant moralizing about gratitude, particularly from Pumblechook, who implies Pip is ""naturally vicious"" and ungrateful for being raised ""by hand."" Joe tries to comfort Pip by giving him extra gravy. Mr. Wopsle preaches a sermon-like discourse on ""Swine,"" pointedly applying it to Pip, and Pumblechook elaborates on Pip's potential fate as a butchered pig. Mrs. Joe and Mrs. Hubble recount Pip's childhood illnesses and the trouble he caused.

When Mrs. Joe offers Uncle Pumblechook brandy, Pip is filled with dread, remembering he replaced the stolen brandy with tar-water. Pumblechook drinks it, goes into a fit of coughing and spasmodic movements, and rushes out, making hideous faces. Pip believes he has murdered him. Pumblechook is brought back, gasping ""Tar!"" Mrs. Joe is amazed, but Pumblechook imperiously waves away the subject, demanding hot gin and water. Pip feels temporarily saved.

As the table is cleared for dessert, Mrs. Joe proudly announces a ""delightful and delicious present"" from Uncle Pumblechook: a savory pork pie. Pip realizes this is the pie he stole. Overwhelmed with fear and guilt, he runs for his life, but collides head-first with a party of soldiers who have just arrived at the door.

**Chapter V**
The soldiers' sudden appearance causes confusion. Mrs. Joe, returning empty-handed, laments the missing pie. The sergeant explains he is on a king's chase and needs Joe, the blacksmith, to fix a pair of broken handcuffs for ""immediate service."" Joe agrees, estimating two hours of work. Soldiers enter the kitchen and stack their muskets. Pip, realizing he is not the target, regains his composure.

The sergeant asks Pumblechook for the time (half past two) and the distance to the marshes (about a mile), stating they plan to ""close in upon ’em about dusk."" Mr. Wopsle asks if they are after ""convicts,"" and the sergeant confirms, ""two."" He asks if anyone has seen anything, and everyone, except Pip, confidently says no. Joe begins working in the forge. Mrs. Joe, in a display of liberality, offers beer to the soldiers and brandy to the sergeant. Pumblechook interjects, offering wine instead, with a pointed remark about tar. The sergeant accepts the wine, and he and Pumblechook exchange pleasantries, with Pumblechook enjoying the credit for the wine. Pip reflects on the irony of their excitement over the impending capture of the fugitive he aided.

Once Joe finishes fixing the handcuffs, he proposes that some of them accompany the soldiers. Pumblechook and Hubble decline, but Mr. Wopsle agrees, and Joe agrees to take Pip if Mrs. Joe approves. Mrs. Joe, curious, allows it, warning about Pip's head. The sergeant, his men, Mr. Wopsle, Joe, and Pip set off for the marshes, with orders to stay in the rear and be silent. Pip secretly hopes they don't find the convicts, and Joe wishes they had ""cut and run.""

Upon reaching the churchyard, soldiers search but find nothing. They continue onto the open marshes. A bitter sleet begins to fall, and Joe carries Pip on his back. Pip fears his convict will think he led the soldiers to him. They hear shouts from the east, suggesting a struggle, and the sergeant orders them to move quickly. They find the two convicts fighting in a ditch. Pip's convict (Magwitch) declares he captured the other convict and ""gave him up"" to the soldiers. The other convict, bruised and fearful, accuses Magwitch of trying to murder him. Magwitch boasts of escaping the prison-ship alone and dragging the other man back. He calls the other convict a liar and defies him to look him in the face.

As torches are lit, Magwitch sees Pip for the first time since the morning. Pip tries to convey his innocence, but Magwitch gives him an unreadable look. Cannon fire is heard, signaling the prison-ships. The convicts are separated and taken towards the landing-place. In a hut, Magwitch makes a statement, wishing to prevent suspicion from falling on others. He confesses to stealing food, liquor, and a pie from ""the blacksmith’s."" The sergeant asks Joe if he missed a pie, which Joe confirms. Magwitch, turning to Joe, says, ""I’ve eat your pie."" Joe, mindful of Mrs. Joe, but with genuine kindness, tells Magwitch he is welcome to it, saying they wouldn't have starved him. Magwitch's throat clicks. The convicts are then taken by boat to the ""black Hulk"" (prison-ship), which Pip observes as ironed like its prisoners. Torches are flung into the water as a final signal.

**Chapter VI**
Pip, now free from the immediate fear of discovery, feels guilty for not confessing his pilfering to Joe, whom he loves. He worries that revealing the truth would make Joe think him worse than he is and lead to a loss of Joe's confidence. Joe carries Pip home on his back. Mr. Wopsle, tired and ill-tempered, blames the expedition. Inside, Joe recounts the convict's confession, and the other visitors invent elaborate theories about how the convict entered the pantry, with Pumblechook's wild theory being accepted. Pip's sister takes him to bed. Pip's internal struggle with guilt and secrecy persists long after.

**Chapter VII**
Pip's early education is described, including his literal interpretations of tombstones and catechism lessons. He is to be apprenticed to Joe and works odd jobs for neighbors, with his earnings saved in a money-box. Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt keeps an evening school and a small shop, assisted by her granddaughter, Biddy, an orphan like Pip. Pip learns to read, write, and cipher with Biddy's help.

One winter night, a year after the marsh incident, Pip writes a simple letter to Joe on his slate. Joe, illiterate, is amazed by Pip's ""scholarship."" Joe then reveals his own childhood: his father was a violent drunkard who often beat his mother and him, preventing him from attending school. Joe worked as a blacksmith to support his father until his death, and later his mother. Feeling lonely, Joe married Pip's sister, assuring her he would take in ""the poor little child"" (Pip). Pip is deeply moved by Joe's kindness.

Joe explains that Mrs. Joe, who is ""given to government"" (controlling), would disapprove of his learning, fearing he might ""rise"" and become a ""rebel."" He speaks of her violent ""Ram-page"" fits. Pip feels a new admiration for Joe.

Later, Mrs. Joe and Uncle Pumblechook return from market, with Mrs. Joe excitedly announcing that ""Miss Havisham, up town,"" wants Pip to go and play there. Pumblechook, who had recommended Pip, believes Pip's fortune will be made. Mrs. Joe subjects Pip to a thorough cleaning and dresses him in his uncomfortable best suit. Pumblechook gives Pip a lecture on gratitude. Pip leaves with Pumblechook in his chaise-cart, still uncertain about what he is meant to do at Miss Havisham's.

**Chapter VIII**
Pip spends the night at Mr. Pumblechook's, finding breakfast with him unpleasant due to his constant arithmetic questions and meager portions. At ten o'clock, they go to Miss Havisham's, an old, dismal, barred brick house with a disused brewery. A young lady, Estella, lets them in but prevents Pumblechook from entering, stating Miss Havisham does not wish to see him. Pumblechook, offended, departs with a final admonition for Pip to behave well.

Estella, scornful and acting much older than Pip, leads him through dark passages by candlelight. She tells him the house's other name is ""Satis,"" meaning ""enough,"" implying that its owner should want nothing else. She then leaves him alone in a large, candle-lit dressing-room, taking the candle with her. Pip, frightened, enters to find Miss Havisham.

Miss Havisham is an old lady dressed in faded, yellowing white bridal clothes, with white hair and bridal flowers. One shoe is on, the other on the table. Her watch and a clock in the room are stopped at twenty minutes to nine. Her figure is shrunken and withered. Pip is terrified, likening her to a waxwork and a skeleton. She asks Pip his name and why he has come, then tells him to come closer. She asks what he touches on her left side, and when he replies, ""Your heart,"" she exclaims, ""Broken!"" with a weird smile.

Miss Havisham, stating she is tired and wants ""diversion,"" commands Pip to ""play."" Pip, confused and fearing his sister's wrath, struggles to comply. After he admits he is sorry for her but cannot play, Miss Havisham calls for Estella. Estella, whom Pip recognizes as the young lady from the gate, is beautiful but proud. Miss Havisham tells Estella she can ""break his heart"" and instructs them to play cards. Estella mocks Pip's ""coarse hands"" and ""thick boots,"" winning the game easily. Pip feels ashamed. Miss Havisham, observing, asks Pip what he thinks of Estella. He whispers that she is proud, pretty, and insulting, and he wants to go home. Miss Havisham sends him downstairs to eat and roam, telling him to return in six days.

Estella gives Pip bread, meat, and beer in a ""dog-like"" manner, humiliating him and making him cry in secret. He explores the deserted brewery and garden. He has a brief, terrifying hallucination of Miss Havisham hanging from a beam. Estella returns, taunting him for crying, then lets him out. Pip goes to Pumblechook's, leaves a message, and walks home, feeling ashamed of his common background and resolving to ask Joe why ""knaves"" are called ""Jacks.""

**Chapter IX**
Pip's sister subjects him to intense questioning about Miss Havisham's house, physically punishing him for his insufficient answers. Pip struggles to describe the strange reality of Satis House to his sister and Pumblechook, fearing they would not understand or would judge Miss Havisham and Estella. When Pumblechook arrives, demanding details, Pip invents an extravagant story: Miss Havisham sits in a black velvet coach in her room, served cake and wine on gold plates by Estella, and has immense dogs that fight for veal-cutlets. He adds details about flags and swords, and a cupboard with pistols, jam, and pills. Pumblechook, who has never seen Miss Havisham, corroborates the candle-lit room.

Joe is amazed by the story, but Mrs. Joe and Pumblechook speculate about Pip's future, assuming Miss Havisham will ""do something"" for him. Joe innocently suggests Pip might get one of the dogs, which Mrs. Joe dismisses angrily, sending him to work. Later, Pip, feeling immense guilt towards Joe, confesses that his stories were lies. Joe is shocked but calmly tells Pip that ""lies is lies"" and will not make him less common. Joe then tells Pip about his own abusive childhood with an alcoholic father, explaining how it prevented his education. He recalls marrying Pip's sister out of loneliness and his efforts to protect Pip. He reveals Mrs. Joe's controlling nature. Pip develops a new admiration for Joe.

Mrs. Joe and Pumblechook return from market, and Mrs. Joe excitedly announces that Miss Havisham wants Pip to ""play"" at her house. Pumblechook, having recommended Pip, believes Pip's fortune will be made. Pip endures a rigorous cleaning and is dressed in uncomfortable clothes. He leaves with Pumblechook, still confused about his role at Satis House.

**Chapter X**
Pip decides to improve himself by getting all of Biddy's knowledge. He describes the chaotic evening school run by Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt, where Biddy is the true teacher. Pip makes progress in reading, writing, and arithmetic.

One Saturday night, Pip goes to call Joe from the Three Jolly Bargemen pub. There, he finds Joe, Mr. Wopsle, and a stranger. The stranger, a ""secret-looking man,"" pays for their rum and questions Joe about his blacksmithing and the earlier convict chase. He learns Pip was present. When stirring his rum, the stranger uses a file, which only Pip sees. Pip immediately recognizes it as Joe's file and realizes this man knows his convict. As Joe and Pip leave, the stranger gives Pip a shilling, folded in crumpled paper.

At home, Mrs. Joe discovers two one-pound notes inside the paper. Joe, in his honesty, rushes back to the pub to return them, but the stranger is gone. Mrs. Joe puts the notes away. Pip is haunted by the encounter, realizing he is entangled in a secret conspiracy with convicts.

**Chapter XI**
Pip returns to Miss Havisham's. Estella leads him to a gloomy room where he finds Miss Havisham's relatives: Camilla, Sarah Pocket, and Cousin Raymond. They are sycophantic and critical, discussing a deceased relative and the proper degree of mourning. Estella takes Pip aside and slaps him, mocking him for not crying. On the stairs, they encounter a ""burly man"" with a large head and suspicious eyes, who inspects Pip and warns him to ""behave yourself."" This man, whose hand smells of scented soap, is Mr. Jaggers.

In Miss Havisham's room, everything is unchanged. She sends Pip into a large, dusty room with a long table, a decayed bride-cake, and cobwebs. Miss Havisham enters, looking like a witch, and tells Pip he is to walk her around the room, leaning on his shoulder. Estella brings in the relatives, who continue their fawning and complaining. Miss Havisham, irritated, dismisses them, declaring they will ""feast upon me"" when she is laid out on the table. She then tells Pip it is her birthday and recounts the story of her jilted wedding day, when the clocks stopped at twenty minutes to nine. She implies her current state is a ""curse upon him"" (the absent bridegroom).

Pip and Estella play cards again. Estella treats Pip with disdain. She later takes him to be fed ""dog-like."" Wandering in the garden, Pip encounters a ""pale young gentleman"" (Herbert Pocket) who challenges him to a fight. Pip knocks him down repeatedly, winning the fight. Estella, observing, is delighted and allows Pip to kiss her cheek, though Pip feels it is a kiss given to a ""common boy"" and ""worth nothing."" Pip returns home, troubled by his ""coarse"" hands and ""thick"" boots, and his love for Estella.

**Chapter XII**
Pip is plagued by fear of legal consequences for the fight, but nothing comes of it. He continues his routine of pushing Miss Havisham in her chair every other day for several months. Miss Havisham often asks about Estella's beauty, appearing to ""enjoy it greedily"" when Pip confirms she is growing prettier. She whispers to Estella, ""Break their hearts my pride and hope, break their hearts and have no mercy!"" Pip begins to hum ""Old Clem,"" a blacksmith's song, which Miss Havisham and Estella sometimes join. Pip remains ashamed of his home and trade.

Miss Havisham notices Pip is growing taller and decides it is time for him to be apprenticed. She asks Joe to come with Pip and his indentures. Mrs. Joe reacts with a violent ""Ram-page,"" throwing a candlestick at Joe and cleaning the house furiously.

**Chapter XIII**
Joe, dressed uncomfortably in his Sunday best, accompanies Pip to Miss Havisham's. Mrs. Joe insists on coming along to Pumblechook's. Estella opens the gate and ignores them. In Miss Havisham's room, Joe, flustered, addresses Pip instead of Miss Havisham. Miss Havisham confirms Joe is Pip's guardian and asks about his apprenticeship. Joe confirms Pip's desire for the trade. Miss Havisham demands Pip's indentures and, upon seeing them, offers ""five-and-twenty guineas"" as a premium for Pip. Joe, astonished, accepts the money for Mrs. Joe's ""satisfaction,"" expressing convoluted gratitude. Miss Havisham tells Pip he is not to return, as Joe is now his master.

At Pumblechook's, Mrs. Joe is delighted by the money. Pumblechook exaggerates his role in Pip's fortune, and they all go to the Town Hall, where Pip is formally bound as Joe's apprentice. Pumblechook treats Pip like a criminal, and people in the court seem to share this view. Afterward, they have a melancholy dinner at the Blue Boar, where Pumblechook continues to lecture Pip, and Mr. Wopsle performs a dramatic reading. Pip feels wretched, realizing he now hates Joe's trade.

**Chapter XIV**
Pip feels deep shame for his home and his life as a blacksmith, wanting to keep it hidden from Miss Havisham and Estella. He is haunted by the fear of Estella seeing him in his ""coarse"" work and despising him. He acknowledges Joe's unwavering goodness and faithfulness, which prevented him from running away, but admits his own ""restlessly aspiring discontent.""

**Chapter XV**
Pip's formal education ends. He tries to teach Joe, hoping to make him less ""common"" and more worthy of his society, especially to impress Estella. Their lessons at the old Battery are ineffective for Joe, who merely smokes his pipe with a ""sagacious air."" Pip's thoughts are constantly on Miss Havisham and Estella.

Pip suggests visiting Miss Havisham, but Joe discourages it, believing she made it clear she wanted no further connection when she gave the premium. Pip argues he hasn't thanked her. When Joe misunderstands and thinks Pip wants to give a present, Pip clarifies he wants a half-holiday for a visit. Joe agrees, with the condition that Pip is to be received cordially or not return.

Orlick, Joe's surly journeyman, demands a half-holiday too. An argument escalates into a fight between Joe and Orlick, which Joe wins easily. Mrs. Joe collapses. Later, Joe and Orlick peaceably sweep up.

Pip goes to Miss Havisham's, where she gives him his annual guinea and tells him to return on his next birthday. Pip is still dissatisfied with his life. On a walk with Biddy, Pip confesses his desire to be a ""gentleman"" because Estella called him ""common."" Biddy tries to dissuade him, suggesting he is happier as he is, and asks if he wants to be a gentleman ""to spite her or to gain her over."" She points out that Estella is ""not worth gaining over"" and that Joe is proud in his own way. Pip, frustrated, accuses Biddy of envy. They encounter Orlick, who, Biddy whispers, ""likes her"" and ""dances at me."" Pip is angered by this.

Later, Mrs. Joe is found struck down by a severe blow to the head, with a filed-asunder convict's leg-iron nearby. Nothing was stolen. Joe and Pip have an alibi. Pip infers the iron is his convict's, but suspects Orlick or the ""strange man"" from the pub as the assailant. The police are ineffective. Mrs. Joe is left severely impaired, unable to speak clearly. Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt dies, and Biddy moves in, becoming a blessing to the household and Mrs. Joe's devoted caregiver. Biddy figures out that Mrs. Joe's slate drawing of a ""T"" signifies Orlick, by his hammer. Mrs. Joe, to Pip's surprise, shows great anxiety to be on good terms with Orlick.

**Chapter XVII**
Pip's life as an apprentice is monotonous, marked only by his annual visits to Miss Havisham, who remains unchanged and gives him a guinea. He continues to feel shame for his home and trade. Biddy, however, transforms, becoming neat, clean, and thoughtful. Pip realizes she is as knowledgeable as he is, even in blacksmithing terms. He confesses his desire to be a gentleman for Estella's sake, but Biddy gently challenges his motivations and values. During a walk, Pip learns from Biddy that Orlick ""likes her"" and ""dances at me."" Pip is angered by this and vows to protect Biddy.

**Chapter XVIII**
Pip, now in his fourth year of apprenticeship, is at the Three Jolly Bargemen when he encounters a ""strange gentleman"" he recognizes as the lawyer from Miss Havisham's stairs – Mr. Jaggers. Jaggers, who has been listening to Mr. Wopsle's dramatic reading of a murder trial, challenges Wopsle's quick verdict, emphasizing the presumption of innocence and the lack of cross-examination. Jaggers then asks for Joe Gargery, and then for Pip. He takes Joe and Pip to their home for a private conference.

Jaggers, acting as an agent for an unnamed benefactor, announces that Pip has ""great expectations."" He states that Pip is to be removed from his current life, educated as a gentleman, and always keep the name Pip. The benefactor's identity is a profound secret, not to be inquired about by Pip. Jaggers, as Pip's guardian, provides twenty guineas for new clothes and suggests Mr. Matthew Pocket (Miss Havisham's cousin) as his tutor. Jaggers offers Joe compensation for losing Pip's services, but Joe, deeply moved, refuses the money, saying Pip is ""hearty welcome"" to go free. Jaggers dismisses Joe's sentiment as foolish. He then instructs Pip to come to London in a week.

Pip, Joe, and Biddy discuss the news. Pip asks them to keep the benefactor's identity a secret. Mrs. Joe is excited by the money Joe received, and Pumblechook takes credit for Pip's good fortune, insisting Pip be bound as an apprentice at once. Pip is formally bound apprentice to Joe before the Justices. Afterward, Pumblechook celebrates Pip's fortune, lecturing him on the responsibilities of his new status. Pip feels wretched, recognizing that he now dislikes his trade and is ashamed of his home. He leaves for London, filled with complex emotions, grateful for Joe's steadfast love but also ashamed of his past and present conduct.

**Chapter XIX**
Pip reflects on the profound change in his life, feeling a ""sublime compassion"" for the villagers he is leaving behind. He bids farewell to the marshes and his old life, asserting he is now ""for London and greatness."" He wakes to find Joe beside him, who says he ""thought I’d foller"" for the last time. Pip assures Joe he will never forget him. Pip, somewhat annoyed by Joe's secure confidence, reveals his long-held desire to be a gentleman. He then asks Biddy to help Joe improve himself, but Biddy gently questions Pip's motives, suggesting Joe's pride and self-respect are sufficient. Pip, offended, accuses Biddy of envy. Biddy, however, assures him of her unwavering support for Joe and her care for Pip. Pip is troubled by his ingratitude but resolves to pursue his new path.

He buys new, fashionable clothes from Mr. Trabb, who, upon learning of Pip's fortune, becomes obsequious. Trabb's disrespectful boy, however, mockingly prostrates himself before Pip, then struts around imitating him, causing Pip great embarrassment. Pip, enraged, writes to Trabb, refusing further business. He then visits Pumblechook, who fawns over him and claims credit for his good fortune. Pip corrects him.

At Miss Havisham's, Estella, now more beautiful and womanly after her time in France, again meets Pip. Pip feels his ""common"" past return in her presence. Miss Havisham gloats over Pip's new status in front of the envious Sarah Pocket. Estella confirms that Pip's change of fortune has led him to ""change your companions"" and that his old company is ""quite unfit."" Pip and Estella walk in the ruined garden, where she denies remembering her past cruelty towards him, and claims she has ""no heart."" She provocatively states she ""deceive[s] and entrap[s]"" others, ""all of them but you.""

Miss Havisham, alone with Pip, passionately commands him to ""Love her, love her, love her!"" explaining that she ""adopted her, to be loved"" and bred her ""to wreak revenge on all the male sex,"" as she herself had been jilted. Pip realizes Estella is a tool for Miss Havisham's revenge. Jaggers arrives, observing their intense conversation. Later, Jaggers discreetly confirms that Estella's surname is Havisham, not his, and that Miss Havisham has not eaten or drunk in his presence since her seclusion. Estella will soon go to London, and Pip is to meet her coach. Pip departs, still deeply in love with Estella, but also aware of the pain she causes him.

**Chapter XXX**
Pip decides to warn Jaggers about Orlick's unsuitability for Miss Havisham's employment. Jaggers agrees to dismiss Orlick. Pip then travels to his old town, where Trabb's boy publicly mocks his new gentlemanly status. Pip, humiliated, writes to Trabb to protest. In London, Pip confesses to Herbert his deep adoration for Estella, which Herbert says he always knew. Herbert, however, warns Pip about the dangers of his infatuation and suggests that Estella is not a condition of his inheritance. Herbert then reveals his own engagement to Clara, whose father, Mr. Barley, is a noisy invalid. Pip and Herbert go to a play, where Mr. Wopsle delivers a comically terrible performance of Hamlet.

**Chapter XXXI**
Pip and Herbert watch Mr. Wopsle's disastrous performance of Hamlet, enduring the audience's mockery and Wopsle's self-important pronouncements. After the play, Mr. Wopsle, now using the stage name Waldengarver, is introduced to Pip and Herbert by a Jewish man. Wopsle, still in costume, praises his own performance. Herbert and Pip offer vague compliments. The dresser criticizes Wopsle's ""reading"" of Hamlet. Wopsle later reveals his ""employer"" is the actor playing Claudius, describing him as ""an ignorant and a blatant ass."" Feeling pity, Pip invites Wopsle to supper at Barnard's Inn, where Wopsle reviews his success and plans.

**Chapter XXXII**
Pip receives a letter from Estella, instructing him to meet her coach in London. He is anxious. He encounters Wemmick, who invites him to Newgate Prison, where Jaggers's business operates. Inside, Wemmick, popular and familiar with the prisoners, explains Jaggers's methods of dealing with clients and the legal system. He shows Pip two plaster casts of executed criminals, revealing Jaggers's past defenses. Wemmick invites Pip to his ""Castle"" in Walworth, his private home, where he lives with his deaf ""Aged Parent."" He maintains a strict separation between his professional and private lives. Wemmick advises Pip to observe Jaggers's housekeeper at dinner. Pip leaves Newgate, feeling ""contaminated"" by the prison atmosphere, but then sees Estella at the coach window, waving.

**Chapter XXXIII**
Estella, in a furred traveling-dress, appears more beautiful and winning. She tells Pip she is going to Richmond to live with a lady (Mrs. Brandley) and be introduced into society. Pip is to take her there and pay her expenses from her purse, as they ""are not free to follow our own devices."" Pip hopes this implies a deeper meaning. They go to a private sitting-room at the inn, where Pip is tormented by Estella's casualness.

Estella reveals that Miss Havisham's relatives at Satis House (Camilla, Sarah Pocket) send negative reports about Pip to Miss Havisham, but she assures Pip they cannot harm his standing. She then asserts she has ""no heart,"" denying ""softness"" or ""sympathy."" Pip, unsettled, notices a fleeting resemblance to Miss Havisham in her. Estella warns him against expecting tenderness from her. They return to Satis House.

Miss Havisham is even more intensely fond of Estella, devouring her with her gaze. She extracts details from Estella about her admirers, making Pip realize Estella is an instrument of revenge. Estella and Miss Havisham have a sharp argument, with Estella declaring, ""I am what you have made me. Take all the praise, take all the blame…in short, take me."" Estella denies having love or gratitude for Miss Havisham, and Miss Havisham cries out in despair, regretting having put ""ice in its place"" where Estella's heart should be. Pip is moved by Miss Havisham's remorse. He asks Miss Havisham about Estella's parentage, and she reveals Jaggers brought Estella to her as an orphan child when Estella was two or three. Pip is convinced Molly (Jaggers's housekeeper) is Estella's mother.

Later, at a ball, Bentley Drummle toasts Estella, infuriating Pip, who challenges him. Drummle produces a note from Estella confirming she danced with him. Pip confronts Estella, expressing his wretchedness at her encouraging Drummle. Estella calmly responds that she has ""no heart"" and is merely attracting moths to a candle. She tells Pip that she ""deceive[s] and entrap[s] him, and many others,—all of them but you."" She then announces she is going to marry Drummle. Pip is devastated, declaring his enduring love and saying she is ""part of my existence."" Miss Havisham, watching, appears with a ""ghastly stare of pity and remorse."" Pip, heartbroken, walks to London, where he receives a note from Wemmick: ""DON’T GO HOME.""

**Chapter XXXIX**
Pip, now twenty-three and living in the Temple, is alone and dispirited, as Herbert is in Marseilles. On a stormy night, he hears a footstep on the stairs. A rough-looking man, about sixty, with iron-grey hair, enters, holding out both hands. Pip, after a moment of stunned recognition, realizes it is his convict from the marshes. The man, who calls himself Provis, tells Pip, ""I’ve made a gentleman on you! It’s me wot has done it!"" He explains that he swore to make Pip a gentleman with his earnings from sheep-farming in the ""new world,"" living rough so Pip could live smooth. Pip is filled with ""abhorrence, dread, and repugnance.""

Provis reveals he has returned to England at the risk of his life, as he was sentenced to transportation for life, and returning is a felony punishable by death. He plans for Pip to live lavishly and spend his money. He confirms that Jaggers and Wemmick were involved in managing his fortune. Pip, horrified, tries to put him off, stating their ""ways are different."" Provis shows Pip his bulging pocket-book, declaring all his wealth is Pip's. He wants to see Pip ""spend his money like a gentleman.""

Pip, in a panic, asks about precautions for Magwitch's safety. Magwitch dismisses the danger, but reaffirms that returning is ""Death by the rope."" He insists he is here ""for good"" and will face death. He makes Pip promise to secure lodging for him and confide in Herbert, but first Magwitch must approve of Herbert. He makes Herbert swear an oath of secrecy on his small black testament.

**Chapter XL**
Pip, realizing he must hide Provis, decides to tell his laundress and niece that his ""uncle"" has arrived. While getting a light, he stumbles over a crouching man on the staircase but finds no one upon searching. The watchman, however, reports that a ""stranger"" (Provis) had asked for Pip and was accompanied by a ""working person"" in ""dust-coloured clothes."" Pip is troubled.

Provis, now calling himself Abel Magwitch, reveals his past as a ""warmint,"" constantly in and out of jail. He recounts meeting Compeyson, a gentlemanly swindler who used him in various crimes. Magwitch describes how Compeyson framed him, leading to Magwitch receiving a fourteen-year sentence while Compeyson received seven years and a recommendation for mercy. Magwitch vowed revenge and later, on the prison-ship, attacked Compeyson before escaping to the marshes where he first met Pip. He confesses he was the one who captured and returned Compeyson to the authorities after Compeyson escaped. Magwitch admits he has never heard of Compeyson since. Herbert then reveals that Compeyson was Miss Havisham's jilting lover, and that her half-brother, Arthur Havisham, was Compeyson's accomplice, who later died of ""the horrors"" (delirium tremens).

Pip is overwhelmed by the discovery that his benefactor is a convict and that his ""great expectations"" are rooted in crime. He realizes Miss Havisham's true intentions were never for him to marry Estella, but to use him to exact revenge on her family. He feels he has ""deserted Joe"" for this criminal. He fears for Magwitch's life and his own safety.

**Chapter XLI**
Herbert is stunned and disgusted by the truth, sharing Pip's repugnance for Magwitch. Magwitch, however, is oblivious to their feelings, triumphing in having made Pip a gentleman. They are desperate to get Magwitch out of England. Pip feels Magwitch's attachment and his own heavy debt make it impossible to simply abandon him. Herbert warns that if Pip rejects Magwitch, he might recklessly expose himself to recapture. They decide the priority is to get Magwitch out of England, with Pip accompanying him. Pip also decides he must gain more knowledge of Magwitch's history. Magwitch agrees to tell them more over breakfast the next day.

Magwitch comes to breakfast, still full of plans for Pip's success. Pip asks him about his past. Magwitch, after making Herbert swear another oath of secrecy, agrees to reveal more.

**Chapter XLII**
Magwitch recounts his life: ""In jail and out of jail."" He was a ""warmint,"" brought up thieving, and learned to read and write from other itinerants. He met Compeyson, a gentlemanly swindler who used him and framed him in court, leading to Magwitch's longer sentence. Compeyson had an accomplice, Arthur Havisham (Miss Havisham's half-brother), who died raving about a mad lady in white (Miss Havisham). Magwitch describes how Compeyson secured a lighter sentence by presenting himself as a gentleman and blaming Magwitch. Magwitch, after breaking out of the prison-ship, found Compeyson on the marshes and fought him, dragging him back to the soldiers. He was then resentenced to transportation for life. He hopes Compeyson is dead. Herbert confirms that Arthur Havisham was Miss Havisham's half-brother, and Compeyson was her jilting lover.

**Chapter XLIII**
Pip realizes the threat of Compeyson, if alive, informing on Magwitch. He decides he must see Estella and Miss Havisham before leaving England. He goes to Richmond, learning Estella is at Satis House. He travels to his old town, where he encounters Drummle at the Blue Boar, who is pursuing Estella. Pip is angered by Drummle's insolence. He leaves for Satis House.

**Chapter XLIV**
Pip finds Miss Havisham and Estella at Satis House, which is being prepared for sale and demolition. Pip reveals to Miss Havisham that he knows his benefactor is not her, and that he is unhappy. He confronts her about having encouraged his false hopes and used him to punish her ""self-seeking relations."" He defends Matthew and Herbert Pocket, revealing his plan to help Herbert financially, discreetly. Miss Havisham agrees to give him nine hundred pounds for Herbert.

Pip then confesses his enduring love for Estella. Estella, unmoved, reiterates that she has ""no heart"" and cannot return his love. She confirms she encourages Drummle and is going to marry him. Pip is heartbroken, but Estella calmly states she is ""what you have made me"" and that she is tired of her current life. Miss Havisham, deeply affected by this exchange, breaks down, crying, ""What have I done! What have I done!"" She confesses she stole Estella's heart and ""put ice in its place,"" hoping to save her from misery but ultimately creating a weapon of revenge. She reveals Jaggers brought Estella to her.

Pip, now convinced Molly (Jaggers's housekeeper) is Estella's mother, leaves. Miss Havisham later catches fire from her dress. Pip heroically smothers the flames with his great-coat and a tablecloth, burning his hands and arms. Miss Havisham is severely injured, repeatedly crying, ""What have I done!"" and ""Take the pencil and write under my name, ‘I forgive her!’"" Pip, anxious about Magwitch, decides to return to London.

**Chapter XLV**
Pip receives a note from Wemmick: ""DON’T GO HOME."" He stays at an inn in Covent Garden, tormented by fear for Provis's safety. He meets Wemmick at the Castle, where Wemmick reveals he heard that Magwitch had ""disappear[ed]"" from New South Wales and that Pip's chambers ""had been watched."" Wemmick confirms Compeyson is alive and in London. Herbert, alerted by Wemmick, has found a new, secluded lodging for Magwitch by the river, between Limehouse and Greenwich, using the pretext that he is ""Tom, Jack, or Richard"" and needed to be moved. Wemmick urges Pip to secure Magwitch's ""portable property.""

**Chapter XLVI**
Pip visits Magwitch at his new lodging on Mill Pond Bank, a quiet, riverside house kept by Mrs. Whimple. Herbert and Clara (Mr. Barley's daughter) are there. Clara's father, Old Barley, is a noisy invalid with gout, living upstairs, who Herbert calls ""Gruffandgrim."" Pip realizes Provis is ""softened."" Pip, Herbert, and Magwitch devise a plan to escape England. Herbert suggests they (Pip and Herbert) row Magwitch down the river themselves to avoid hiring a boat and attracting suspicion. They plan to use the ebb-tide, lie by, and intercept a foreign steamer. Provis will signal ""All well"" from his window.

Pip returns to his chambers. Later, he overhears two men looking at his boat from his window, confirming his fear of being watched.

**Chapter XLVII**
Weeks pass. Pip accumulates more debt and feels increasingly isolated. He suspects Estella is married and avoids confirmation. He continues his rowing practice. At a theatre, he encounters Mr. Wopsle, who reveals he saw Compeyson sitting behind Pip during the play. Pip is terrified, realizing Compeyson is tracking Magwitch. Pip and Herbert agree to tell Wemmick.

**Chapter XLVIII**
Jaggers invites Pip to dinner. During dinner, Jaggers confirms that Drummle has married Estella (""Our friend the Spider...has won the pool""). He speculates on Drummle's abusive nature. Jaggers then commands his housekeeper, Molly, to show her scarred wrists, revealing her immense strength. Pip, observing her hands and eyes, is convinced Molly is Estella's mother and realizes the connection to Magwitch's story. Wemmick confirms Molly was tried for murder, defended by Jaggers, and acquitted. She had a child, a girl, who disappeared. Jaggers used the threat of revealing the child's whereabouts to control Molly. Pip leaves, troubled by these revelations.

**Chapter XLIX**
Pip returns to Satis House, now set for auction and demolition. He finds Miss Havisham, frail and remorseful, crying, ""What have I done!"" She confesses to the evil she inflicted through Estella. Pip, having realized Molly is Estella's mother, asks Miss Havisham directly about Estella's parentage. Miss Havisham states Jaggers brought Estella to her as an orphan. As Pip is about to leave, Miss Havisham catches fire from her dress near the fireplace. Pip bravely extinguishes the flames, burning his own hands severely. Miss Havisham is badly injured, repeatedly muttering about her actions and asking to be forgiven. Pip, now more concerned for Magwitch, prepares to return to London.

**Chapter L**
Pip's burns are severe, but Herbert nurses him with great care. Herbert reveals more of Magwitch's story: Molly (Estella's mother) was a jealous, revengeful woman who murdered another woman and was acquitted with Jaggers's defense. She had a child with Magwitch, and on the night of the murder, she swore to destroy the child, which she did. Magwitch, fearing he would be forced to testify against her, hid and lost both his child and the child's mother. Compeyson later used this knowledge to exploit Magwitch. Pip then reveals the startling truth to Herbert: Magwitch, the man they are hiding, is Estella's father.

**Chapter LI**
Pip is determined to confirm Estella's parentage and speaks to Jaggers. He informs Jaggers that he knows Estella's mother and father, naming Provis as her father. Jaggers is visibly startled. Pip recounts all he knows, careful not to implicate Wemmick. Pip then appeals to Jaggers, and through Wemmick, to be more open. Jaggers, revealing his ""Walworth sentiments"" (personal, rather than professional), constructs a hypothetical scenario mirroring Magwitch's, Molly's, and Estella's story, concluding that revealing the secret would benefit no one and harm Estella. He and Wemmick tacitly acknowledge their shared knowledge and their roles in protecting Estella's secret. Mike, a client, interrupts, and Jaggers dismisses him with a display of his ruthless office persona.

**Chapter LII**
Pip uses Miss Havisham's money to establish Herbert as a partner in Clarriker and Co., an ""only good thing"" he has done. Herbert is delighted, unaware of Pip's involvement. Pip receives a cryptic note from Wemmick, telling him to ""Burn this as soon as read"" and prepare for their plan ""Early in the week, or say Wednesday."" Pip is disabled by his burns, so Herbert suggests Startop replace him as one of the oarsmen. They plan to take Magwitch downriver on the ebb-tide, lie in wait, and intercept a foreign steamer.

Pip then receives an anonymous, dirty letter, warning him to come alone to the ""sluice-house by the limekiln"" on the marshes that night for ""information regarding _your uncle Provis_."" Pip, despite his injury and fear, feels compelled to go, leaving a hasty note for Herbert. He travels to his old town, where he encounters the inn landlord, who, again, credits Pumblechook for Pip's fortunes. Pip's conscience is deeply troubled by his ingratitude to Joe. Unable to find the anonymous letter, he proceeds to the sluice-house at nine o'clock.

**Chapter LIII**
On the dark, melancholy marshes, Pip finds the sluice-house with a light. He enters, calls out, but hears no reply. As he goes to check the candle, it is extinguished, and he is caught in a noose from behind. His injured arm causes him intense pain. The assailant ties him to a ladder and, striking a light, reveals himself to be Orlick.

Orlick, holding a gun he had previously stolen from Joe's forge, confronts Pip. He blames Pip for costing him his job at Miss Havisham's and for giving him ""a bad name"" to Biddy. He reveals he knows of Pip's efforts to drive him from the country and declares he will take Pip's life. He plans to put Pip's body in the kiln to conceal the crime. Pip is terrified, particularly of being ""misremembered after death,"" fearing Joe, Biddy, and Herbert will misunderstand his last actions, and Estella's children will despise him. Orlick boasts that he attacked Mrs. Joe, leaving her for dead, and that it was Pip's ""doing"" because Pip was favored. He also reveals he was the lurker Pip stumbled over on the stairs and that there are others tracking Magwitch. He warns of ""Compeyson, Magwitch, and the gallows!"" Orlick, after drinking the last of his liquor, picks up a stone-hammer. Pip, in a desperate struggle, shouts out. Herbert, Startop, and Trabb's boy burst in, having followed Pip after finding his alarming note. Orlick escapes.

Pip learns that Herbert, concerned by his note, had found it and, with Startop and Trabb's boy's help, followed him. They tend to Pip's burnt arm. Pip, realizing that going to a magistrate would endanger Magwitch, decides to forgo pursuing Orlick for the moment. They return to London that night by post-chaise.

**Chapter LIV**
The next morning, Pip, Herbert, and Startop set out to meet the Hamburg steamer. They row down the Thames, Magwitch (now in a pilot's cloak) is picked up from Mill Pond Bank, and they proceed through the shipping. Magwitch, surprisingly calm, expresses his joy at being with Pip and his hope for Pip's future as a gentleman abroad. He reflects on the uncertain nature of the future. They land for beer.

As they approach Gravesend, they spot the Hamburg steamer. Just as they are saying goodbye to Herbert and Startop, a ""four-oared galley"" shoots out from under the bank. The man steering it announces, ""You have a returned Transport there...His name is Abel Magwitch, otherwise Provis. I apprehend that man, and call upon him to surrender, and you to assist."" The galley runs broadside into Pip's boat, causing confusion on the steamer. Magwitch, with a desperate burst of energy, starts up, leans across his captor, and pulls the cloak from the ""shrinking sitter"" in the galley, revealing Compeyson. Compeyson's face is filled with ""white terror."" A cry, a splash, and Pip's boat sinks.

Pip is pulled aboard the galley. His boat is gone, and so are the two convicts. The crew searches the water and pulls Magwitch aboard, instantly manacling him. Compeyson is lost. Magwitch is severely injured in the chest and head. He tells Pip in a whisper that he believed he went under the steamer's keel and was struck. He and Compeyson had gone ""down fiercely locked in each other’s arms,"" but he disengaged and swam away. The officer confirms this account. Pip is allowed to buy dry clothes for Magwitch and accompany him to London, but Herbert and Startop must travel by land.

Pip's ""repugnance"" for Magwitch has ""all melted away."" He now sees Magwitch as a benefactor who has been constant, affectionate, and grateful. He feels Magwitch is a ""much better man than I had been to Joe."" Magwitch, severely wounded, breathes with difficulty. Pip realizes Magwitch's possessions will be forfeited to the Crown if he is convicted. Magwitch asks Pip to visit him discreetly in prison. Pip promises to be true to him. Pip realizes Magwitch should never know that his hopes of enriching him have perished.

**Chapter LV**
Magwitch is taken to the Police Court. His trial is delayed for an officer from his old prison-ship to identify him, as Compeyson, who would have testified, is dead. Pip retains Jaggers, who, on Magwitch's behalf, ""would admit nothing."" Pip informs Jaggers of his decision to keep Magwitch ignorant of the forfeiture of his wealth. Jaggers, though acknowledging the inevitability of forfeiture, agrees. Compeyson's body is found, identifiable by notes confirming Magwitch's wealth and lands in New South Wales. Magwitch, in prison, believes his inheritance for Pip is secure.

Magwitch is committed for trial. Herbert, disheartened, tells Pip he must leave for Cairo for a business opportunity, offering Pip a clerk's position in his new branch, which could lead to a partnership. Pip, still preoccupied, asks for two or three months to decide. Herbert agrees, saying he and Clara will marry once her father, Old Barley, dies.

Wemmick explains to Pip that Compeyson had been investigating Magwitch's return, and his death made Magwitch's capture inevitable, though Wemmick regrets the loss of the ""portable property."" Wemmick invites Pip to a walk on Monday. Pip accepts. On Monday morning, Wemmick and Miss Skiffins are married in a church, with Pip acting as best man and the Aged as the reluctant giver-away. Wemmick, still maintaining his separation of ""office"" and ""Walworth"" sentiments, asks Pip not to mention the marriage to Jaggers.

**Chapter LVI**
Magwitch is critically ill in prison. Pip visits him daily, reading to him and offering comfort. Magwitch, weakened, is moved to the infirmary and shows humility and resignation. His trial comes quickly. Jaggers's application for postponement is denied. The trial is short; Magwitch is found guilty, as his return from transportation under a life sentence is undeniable.

Pip witnesses Magwitch and thirty-one other prisoners receive the sentence of death. Magwitch, barely able to breathe, accepts his sentence with dignity. Pip dedicates himself to writing petitions to save Magwitch from execution. Pip's daily visits are shortened, and he is observed closely by officers, suspecting he might bring poison. Magwitch continues to weaken, finding comfort only in Pip's presence.

On the tenth day after his sentencing, Magwitch, with his last strength, thanks Pip for never deserting him and says Pip has been ""more comfortable alonger me, since I was under a dark cloud, than when the sun shone. That’s best of all."" With his last breath, after Pip tells him that his lost child (Estella) is alive, beautiful, a lady, and that Pip loves her, Magwitch raises Pip's hand to his lips and then gently lets it fall upon his breast. Pip prays, ""O Lord, be merciful to him a sinner!""

**Chapter LVII**
After Magwitch's death, Pip is left with considerable debt and falls seriously ill. During his feverish delirium, he frequently sees people's faces transform into Joe's. Eventually, he recognizes Joe sitting by his bedside. Joe's presence brings him immense comfort. Pip, overcome with penitence, apologizes to Joe for his ingratitude. Joe, with his usual kindness, embraces Pip, saying, ""you and me was ever friends.""

Pip learns he has been ill for over a month and that Joe has been by his side the entire time. Joe reveals Biddy, now married (as he implies, to the postman), had urged him to come. Joe, taught to write by Biddy, writes a letter to her for Pip. Pip learns Miss Havisham has died, about a week after his accident. She left most of her property to Estella, but ""a cool four thousand to Mr. Matthew Pocket"" because of ""Pip’s account of him, the said Matthew."" This brings Pip joy, as it is the ""only good thing"" he has done. Joe also mentions other small legacies for Miss Sarah Pocket and Mrs. Camilla. Joe then reveals that Orlick ""bustin’ open a dwelling-ouse"" (Pumblechook's) and is now in county jail. He recounts Orlick's violent assault on Pumblechook.

As Pip slowly recovers, Joe's tenderness and simple confidence make him feel like ""little Pip again."" Joe gently dismisses any discussion of Pip's changed fortunes, implying that their friendship transcends such things. Pip realizes Joe perceives his distance and ingratitude. He resolves to tell Joe everything and propose to Biddy.

The next morning, Pip finds a letter from Joe on the breakfast table. Joe has left, saying, ""Not wishful to intrude I have departured fur you are well again dear Pip and will do better without JO. P.S. Ever the best of friends."" Enclosed is a receipt for Pip's debt, which Joe has paid. Pip, deeply humbled and penitent, resolves to follow Joe, confess all his failures and ingratitude, and then propose to Biddy, offering her his future, either at the forge or in his abandoned opportunity abroad.

**Chapter LVIII**
News of Pip's financial ruin precedes him to his native village. The Blue Boar, once solicitous, is now cool. He visits Satis House, which is being sold for demolition. He sees the auctioneer's clerk on the casks, using the wheeled chair Pip used for Miss Havisham. At the Blue Boar, Pumblechook, now patronizing, reminds Pip of his fall from fortune and claims credit for Pip's past success, asserting his role as Pip's ""earliest benefactor and the founder of my fortun’s."" Pip, infuriated, leaves.

Pip walks towards the forge, envisioning a life with Joe and Biddy. He finds the forge closed. At the house, he sees white curtains and flowers in the best parlour window. Joe and Biddy appear, arm in arm. Biddy, seeing Pip, cries out, then embraces him. She reveals, ""It’s my wedding-day!...and I am married to Joe!""

Pip is devastated but also deeply thankful that he never confessed his ""last baffled hope"" (of marrying Biddy) to Joe. He congratulates them, expressing his profound gratitude for all they have done and how he has ""so ill repaid"" them. He announces he is going abroad ""within the hour"" and will ""never rest until I have worked for the money with which you have kept me out of prison, and have sent it to you."" He asks for their forgiveness, which they both readily give. Pip then goes to his old room, and after eating and drinking with them, they walk him to the finger-post, where he bids them a final good-bye.

Pip sells his remaining possessions to pay his creditors and joins Herbert. Within a month, he leaves England and becomes a clerk to Clarriker and Co. Herbert marries Clara. Many years later, Pip becomes a partner in the firm, and Clarriker reveals Pip secretly funded Herbert's partnership. Pip realizes his earlier negative perception of Herbert was his own ""inaptitude.""

**Chapter LIX**
Eleven years later, Pip returns to his old village. He finds Joe still smoking his pipe by the kitchen fire, hale and strong, though a little grey. A young boy, named Pip for the narrator, sits on his old stool, ""fenced into the corner with Joe’s leg."" Joe, delighted, tells Pip they hoped the child would be ""a little bit like you."" Pip takes the boy for a walk to the churchyard, where the boy points out the tombstones of Philip Pirrip and Georgiana.

After dinner, Pip talks with Biddy, whose little girl is sleeping. Pip asks her to give him the boy, or lend him. Biddy gently suggests, ""You must marry."" Pip says he will not, having settled down with Herbert and Clara as ""quite an old bachelor."" Biddy, looking at her child, places its hand to her lips, then puts her hand (with a wedding-ring) into Pip's, confirming her marriage to Joe. She asks if Pip still ""fret[s] for her"" (Estella). Pip replies that the ""poor dream"" has ""all gone by.""

However, Pip secretly intends to revisit the site of Satis House that evening for Estella's sake. He has heard she led a ""most unhappy life,"" was separated from her cruel husband (Drummle), who died two years prior, and he wonders if she is married again.

He goes to the old spot. The house and brewery are gone, only the garden wall remains. A ""cold silvery mist"" veils the afternoon. He sees a ""solitary figure"" in the desolate garden. As he approaches, the figure utters his name: ""Estella!""

She is ""greatly changed""; the freshness of her beauty is gone, but ""its indescribable majesty and its indescribable charm remained."" Her eyes now have a ""saddened, softened light,"" and her hand a ""friendly touch."" They sit on a bench, reflecting on their first meeting there. Estella reveals the ground belongs to her, the ""only possession I have not relinquished,"" and that it was the ""only determined resistance I made in all the wretched years."" It is to be built on, and she came to take leave of it. She asks if Pip still lives abroad and does well (yes).

Estella says she has ""often thought of you,"" especially ""of late, very often."" She confesses there was a ""long hard time"" when she kept away the remembrance of ""what I had thrown away when I was quite ignorant of its worth,"" but now she has ""given it a place in my heart."" Pip replies, ""You have always held your place in my heart.""

Estella says she ""little thought"" she would take leave of him. Pip says parting is painful. Estella reminds him that he once said, ""'God bless you, God forgive you!' And if you could say that to me then, you will not hesitate to say that to me now,—now, when suffering has been stronger than all other teaching, and has taught me to understand what your heart used to be. I have been bent and broken, but—I hope—into a better shape. Be as considerate and good to me as you were, and tell me we are friends.""

Pip, rising and bending over her, says, ""We are friends."" Estella adds, ""And will continue friends apart."" Pip takes her hand, and they walk out of the ruined place. As the evening mists rise, Pip sees ""no shadow of another parting from her."""
Hamlet-William Shakespeare,"The play opens at night on a platform before Elsinore Castle, where Francisco is relieved by Bernardo. They are soon joined by Horatio and Marcellus. Horatio, initially skeptical, has been invited to witness a strange apparition that Bernardo and Marcellus have seen twice before. Suddenly, a Ghost appears, resembling the recently deceased King Hamlet, clad in his armor. Horatio attempts to speak to it, but it silently stalks away. Horatio, now convinced, describes the Ghost's striking resemblance to the late king, especially when he combated Norway. The Ghost reappears, and Horatio tries again to elicit a response, asking if it has a message, a good deed to be done, knowledge of the country's fate, or hidden treasure. However, the cock crows, and the Ghost, ""like a guilty thing,"" vanishes. Horatio suggests they tell young Hamlet, believing the Ghost will speak to him.

In a room of state in the palace, the new King Claudius (brother to the deceased King Hamlet) addresses his court. He acknowledges his brother's death but celebrates his marriage to Queen Gertrude (Hamlet's mother) as a matter of state and wisdom. He grants Laertes, son of the chief counselor Polonius, permission to return to France. Claudius then questions his nephew, Prince Hamlet, about his continued deep mourning. Queen Gertrude urges Hamlet to abandon his ""nighted colour"" and accept that all things must die. Hamlet expresses his profound internal grief, claiming his outward signs of sorrow are but ""trappings"" compared to his true feelings. The King and Queen urge him to remain in Denmark rather than return to Wittenberg for studies. Hamlet reluctantly agrees. Left alone, Hamlet expresses extreme despair, viewing the world as a corrupted, ""unweeded garden."" He bitterly laments his mother's swift, incestuous marriage to his uncle, Claudius, less than two months after his noble father's death. Horatio, Bernardo, and Marcellus enter and inform a shocked Hamlet that they saw his father's Ghost. Hamlet questions them closely and, after confirming the details, resolves to join them on watch that night, intending to speak to his father's spirit. He makes them swear to secrecy, suspecting ""foul play.""

At Polonius's house, Laertes advises his sister, Ophelia, to consider Hamlet's affections as a fleeting, youthful fancy, warning that as a prince, Hamlet's choice in marriage is dictated by the state, not his own desires. He cautions her to protect her honor. Ophelia promises to heed his advice but playfully warns him not to be hypocritical. Polonius enters, hurrying Laertes off to France, and offers a lengthy list of moral precepts, notably ""To thine ownself be true."" After Laertes departs, Polonius interrogates Ophelia about Hamlet's ""tenders of his affection."" Ophelia confirms Hamlet's ""honourable"" love and ""holy vows."" Polonius, however, dismisses Hamlet's advances as mere ""springes to catch woodcocks"" and strictly forbids Ophelia from any further contact with Hamlet. Ophelia, obediently, agrees.

Back on the platform, Hamlet, Horatio, and Marcellus await the Ghost. Hamlet laments the Danish custom of excessive drinking and revelry, which he finds dishonorable. The Ghost appears. Hamlet courageously addresses it, calling it his father and demanding to know why it has returned. The Ghost beckons Hamlet to a more remote spot, alone. Horatio and Marcellus try to stop Hamlet, fearing the Ghost might lead him to harm or madness, but Hamlet, undeterred, threatens them and follows.

In a remote part of the platform, the Ghost reveals itself as King Hamlet's spirit, tormented and bound to walk the night and suffer in fires during the day for his sins, until purged. It charges Hamlet to ""Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder."" The Ghost reveals that Claudius, Hamlet's uncle, not a serpent, murdered him. Claudius seduced Gertrude with ""witchcraft of his wit"" and ""traitorous gifts."" While King Hamlet was sleeping in his orchard in the afternoon, Claudius poured ""juice of cursed hebenon"" (poison) into his ears, killing him instantly and leaving him to die without confession or last rites. The Ghost urges Hamlet to seek revenge but explicitly forbids him from harming his mother, instructing him to leave her to Heaven and her own conscience. As dawn breaks, the Ghost fades, repeating ""remember me."" Overwhelmed, Hamlet vows to dedicate himself entirely to the Ghost's command. Horatio and Marcellus return, and Hamlet, speaking wildly, makes them swear on his sword and by the Ghost's voice from below the ground, to keep secret what they have seen and heard, and to never betray any knowledge of his potentially ""antick disposition."" Hamlet laments his cursed fate: ""The time is out of joint;--O cursèd spite, / That ever I was born to set it right!""

**Act II**
Ophelia, greatly distressed, tells Polonius that Hamlet appeared before her in a disheveled, piteous state. He seized her wrist, studied her face, sighed profoundly, and then left without looking back. Polonius concludes that Hamlet's madness is caused by Ophelia's rejection of his love, as he had commanded her to repel his letters and deny him access. Polonius decides to inform the King.

The King and Queen welcome Hamlet's friends, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, asking them to discover the cause of Hamlet's recent ""transformation."" Polonius then enters, confidently asserting he has found the source of Hamlet's ""lunacy."" He explains that Hamlet is mad due to his daughter's obedience in rejecting his advances. Polonius reads a love letter from Hamlet to Ophelia, filled with fervent vows. He recounts how his prohibition led Hamlet from sadness to madness. Polonius proposes that he and the King hide and observe a planned encounter between Hamlet and Ophelia to confirm his theory. The King and Queen agree. Hamlet enters, reading, and Polonius approaches him. Hamlet engages in cryptic, seemingly mad dialogue, calling Polonius a ""fishmonger"" and warning him about his daughter. Polonius, though confused, notes ""Though this be madness, yet there's method in it."" After Polonius leaves, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern greet Hamlet. Hamlet quickly discerns they were ""sent for"" and expresses his deep melancholy, seeing the world as a ""steril promontory"" and humanity as a ""quintessence of dust"" that delights him not. They inform him that a company of players is arriving. Hamlet is pleased and welcomes them. Polonius returns to announce the players. Hamlet continues his eccentric behavior, mockingly comparing Polonius to Jephthah, who sacrificed his daughter. The players arrive, and Hamlet greets them warmly, asking for a passionate speech. The First Player recites a moving passage about Priam's slaughter and Hecuba's grief, deeply affecting Polonius. Hamlet then asks the players to perform ""The Murder of Gonzago"" the following night, with a dozen or sixteen lines of his own insertion. Alone, Hamlet chastises himself for his inaction and lack of emotional intensity compared to the player. He resolves to use the play, which mirrors his father's murder, to ""catch the conscience of the king"" and confirm the Ghost's truthfulness, as he fears the spirit might be a devil attempting to damn him.

**Act III**
The King and Queen learn from Rosencrantz and Guildenstern that Hamlet is distracted but refuses to reveal the cause of his condition. They report Hamlet's excitement about the players and his invitation for the King and Queen to attend the play. The King is pleased. He then directs Gertrude to leave so he and Polonius can observe Hamlet's meeting with Ophelia. Polonius instructs Ophelia to walk and read, making her loneliness appear natural. Polonius's aside about using ""devotion's visage"" to ""sugar o'er the devil"" strikes the King, who, in his own aside, admits a pang of conscience. Hamlet enters, delivering his ""To be, or not to be"" soliloquy, contemplating suicide but deterred by the uncertainty of the afterlife. He encounters Ophelia, who attempts to return his ""remembrances."" Hamlet denies ever giving them and, in a harsh, seemingly mad tirade, repudiates his love, questions her honesty, and repeatedly tells her to ""Get thee to a nunnery"" to avoid being a ""breeder of sinners."" He criticizes women's deceitful appearances and declares there will be ""no more marriages,"" suggesting all but ""one"" (implying the King) of those already married shall live. A heartbroken Ophelia laments the ""noble mind ... o'erthrown."" The King and Polonius re-enter. The King, observing Hamlet's behavior, concludes it is not love-sickness but a dangerous melancholy, and decides to send Hamlet to England immediately on the pretext of demanding tribute. Polonius still attributes Hamlet's state to neglected love and proposes a final attempt: the Queen should confront Hamlet alone after the play, with Polonius hidden to overhear. If this fails, then England or confinement. The King agrees, stating, ""Madness in great ones must not unwatch'd go.""

Hamlet instructs the First Player on the art of natural acting, avoiding over-the-top dramatics and advising the clowns not to improvise. He then confides in Horatio, praising him as a loyal and balanced friend. Hamlet reveals his plan to observe the King's reaction during the play, specifically during a scene resembling his father's murder, asking Horatio to watch the King keenly. The royal court enters for the play. Hamlet, seated by Ophelia, makes provocative and bawdy remarks. The play, ""The Mouse-trap"" (or ""The Murder of Gonzago""), begins. A Player King and Queen express their deep love, and the Player Queen vows never to remarry. Hamlet, in asides, scathingly comments on his mother's quick marriage. During the play, Lucianus, the Player King's nephew, pours poison into the sleeping King's ear. Hamlet loudly explains the plot: the murderer kills the king ""for his estate"" and wins the queen. The King, visibly disturbed, abruptly cries for ""light"" and rushes out, followed by the panicked court. Hamlet and Horatio are left, exhilarated, convinced of Claudius's guilt. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern return, reporting the King's ""distemper"" and the Queen's distress, requesting Hamlet's presence. Hamlet, though, evades their questions and accuses them of trying to manipulate him. He takes a recorder and asks Guildenstern to play it, but Guildenstern claims he cannot. Hamlet then compares this to their attempts to ""play upon me"" as if he were easier to manipulate than a simple pipe. Polonius enters, also urging Hamlet to see his mother. Hamlet, still feigning madness, agrees, noting that ""They fool me to the top of my bent."" Alone, Hamlet prepares to confront his mother, resolving to ""speak daggers to her, but use none.""

The King, disturbed by Hamlet's behavior, resolves to send him to England at once. Polonius informs the King that Hamlet is going to his mother's chamber, and Polonius will hide behind the arras to overhear their conversation. The King, left alone, delivers a soliloquy confessing his heinous crime: ""O, my offence is rank, it smells to heaven; / It hath the primal eldest curse upon't, / A brother's murder."" He attempts to pray but finds he cannot genuinely repent while still enjoying the fruits of his crime: his crown, ambition, and queen.

In the Queen's chamber, Polonius instructs her to be firm with Hamlet before hiding behind the arras. Hamlet enters and fiercely chastises his mother for her marriage. When she threatens to send others to speak to him, Hamlet forces her to sit and promises to show her her ""inmost part."" Frightened, the Queen cries for help, and Polonius, from behind the arras, echoes her cry. Hamlet, thinking it is the King (""How now! a rat?""), thrusts his rapier through the arras, killing Polonius. The Queen is horrified. Hamlet, realizing his mistake, calls Polonius a ""wretched, rash, intruding fool."" He then intensely condemns his mother's marriage, comparing his noble father's image to Claudius, a ""mildew'd ear."" He graphically accuses her of ""damnèd incest"" and ""luxury."" The Queen is deeply shaken. The Ghost of King Hamlet reappears, visible only to Hamlet, reminding him to ""whet thy almost blunted purpose"" and to be gentle with his mother. The Queen, seeing Hamlet speak to empty air, believes he is mad. Hamlet tries to describe the Ghost to her, but she sees nothing. He assures her he is not mad and urges her to confess her sins to Heaven, repent, and avoid Claudius's bed. The Queen, heartbroken, vows to heed his words. Hamlet, regretting Polonius's death, promises to answer for it. He exits, dragging Polonius's body, proclaiming, ""I must be cruel, only to be kind: / Thus bad begins, and worse remains behind.""

**Act IV**
The Queen informs the King that Hamlet, in a fit of madness, killed Polonius, having mistaken him for a ""rat"" behind the arras. The King, horrified that it could have been him, orders Rosencrantz and Guildenstern to find Hamlet, speak gently, and bring Polonius's body to the chapel. He acknowledges that Hamlet's popularity prevents severe punishment but resolves to ship him to England immediately. Rosencrantz reports they cannot get Hamlet to reveal the body's location. Hamlet is brought before the King and speaks cryptically, saying Polonius is ""at supper"" where he is eaten by ""politick worms."" He advises the King to seek Polonius in Heaven or, failing that, in hell, before mocking that he'll smell him near the lobby in a month. The King, citing Hamlet's ""especial safety,"" orders him to England. Hamlet accepts, calling the King his mother because ""man and wife is one flesh,"" and departs. The King then reveals his secret intent: letters to England demanding ""The present death of Hamlet,"" hoping this will cure his own unrest.

The Queen initially refuses to see Ophelia, who is ""distract,"" but Horatio persuades her, fearing Ophelia might ""strew dangerous conjectures."" Ophelia enters, singing disjointed, mournful songs, strewing imaginary flowers, and speaking in riddles about her dead father and lost love. The King enters, witnessing her madness, and laments that ""sorrows come, they come not single spies, but in battalions!"" Marcellus reports that Laertes has returned from France with a mob, demanding answers and crying, ""Laertes shall be king!"" Laertes bursts in, armed, confronting the King and demanding his father. The Queen attempts to interpose. Laertes furiously asserts his rage, declaring his intent for revenge. The King assures Laertes of his innocence in Polonius's death and promises to help him find justice. Ophelia re-enters, still mad, distributing real or imaginary flowers each with symbolic meaning (rosemary for remembrance, pansies for thoughts, rue for sorrow). Laertes is overcome with grief at his sister's state. Attendants deliver letters from Hamlet to the King. Hamlet writes that he has returned ""naked"" to Denmark and will recount his ""sudden and more strange return"" tomorrow. Laertes is enraged by Hamlet's return. The King, seizing the opportunity, proposes a plot to Laertes: he will praise Laertes's fencing skill to Hamlet, then arrange a duel. Hamlet, being unsuspicious, will not inspect the foils, allowing Laertes to use an ""unbated"" (unblunted) and envenomed rapier to kill Hamlet. Laertes eagerly agrees, adding he has a deadly poison to coat his blade, ensuring even a scratch will be fatal. The King, as a backup, suggests preparing a poisoned drink for Hamlet during the match. The Queen then enters, announcing that Ophelia has drowned. She describes Ophelia's poetic death while making garlands by a brook, where a branch broke, sending her into the water, and she drifted to her ""muddy death."" Laertes is distraught but tries to suppress his tears, acknowledging that ""nature her custom holds"" to weep. He exits, vowing to act on his ""speech of fire.""

**Act V**
Two grave-diggers prepare a grave for Ophelia, debating whether she deserves a Christian burial given the suspicion of suicide. They use convoluted legal logic to argue her case. The First Clown asserts that ""crowner's-quest law"" has ruled it Christian. He bemoans that ""great folks"" get more leeway in suicide than ""even christian."" He then engages in riddles, identifying a grave-maker as the builder of the strongest ""houses"" (graves). Hamlet and Horatio enter, observing the grave-digger singing cheerfully while unearthing skulls. Hamlet reflects on the skulls, imagining them belonging to a politician or lawyer. The grave-digger reveals one skull belonged to Yorick, the king's jester, whom Hamlet knew as a child. Hamlet takes the skull, reflecting on Yorick's past jests and the grim reality of mortality, imagining even Alexander and Caesar returning to such ""base uses."" A funeral procession approaches, including the King, Queen, and Laertes. Hamlet and Horatio hide. Laertes demands more elaborate rites for Ophelia, but the Priest explains that, due to the doubtful nature of her death, she has already received more than warranted by church law. Laertes, furious at the priest's ""churlish"" remarks, proclaims that violets will spring from Ophelia's unpolluted flesh and she will be an ""angel"" while the priest ""howls."" Hamlet, realizing it is Ophelia's funeral, reveals himself, crying, ""What, the fair Ophelia!"" Laertes leaps into the grave, expressing his immense grief and calling for mountains of earth to be piled upon them. Hamlet advances, grappling with Laertes, asserting his own profound love for Ophelia, and challenging Laertes to outdo his grief. They are separated. Hamlet, still ranting, exits, declaring, ""The cat will mew, and dog will have his day."" The King reassures Laertes, reminding him of their plot and urging patience.

In the castle hall, Hamlet apologizes to Horatio for his outburst at Laertes, recognizing their shared cause of grief. Osric, a foppish courtier, enters and, in affected language, informs Hamlet of a fencing match wagered by the King between Hamlet and Laertes. Osric describes Laertes's excellent skill. The wager is six Barbary horses against six French rapiers. Hamlet, mocking Osric's affected speech, agrees to the match. Horatio expresses misgivings about Hamlet winning, but Hamlet dismisses them, saying he has been in practice and trusts ""special providence.""

The court assembles for the fencing match. Hamlet publicly asks Laertes for pardon, attributing his past actions to madness. Laertes accepts Hamlet's apology in terms of his ""nature"" but states his ""honor"" requires him to maintain a formal resentment until advised by elders. Foils are brought. The King announces that if Hamlet scores the first or second hit, or replies to the third, cannons will fire, and he will drink to Hamlet's health, dropping a ""union"" (a pearl, but actually poison) into a cup of wine. The King drinks (or pretends to) and offers the cup to Hamlet, who defers drinking until after the first bout. Hamlet scores the first hit. The King offers the poisoned cup again, but Hamlet delays. Hamlet scores a second hit. The Queen, carousing to Hamlet's fortune, drinks from the cup despite the King's warning, ""Gertrude, do not drink."" The King, aside, realizes ""It is the poison'd cup; it is too late."" Laertes, aside, expresses a pang of conscience but determines to strike Hamlet. They play a third bout. Laertes wounds Hamlet with the poisoned rapier. In the ensuing scuffle, the rapiers are exchanged, and Hamlet wounds Laertes with the poisoned blade. The Queen falls. Laertes, falling, confesses to Hamlet that he is justly killed by his ""own treachery,"" that Hamlet is also poisoned by the unbated and envenomed rapier, and that the Queen is poisoned. He then reveals, ""the king, the king's to blame."" Hamlet, realizing the truth, cries, ""Then, venom, to thy work!"" and stabs the King, forcing him to drink the poisoned cup, calling him ""incestuous, murd'rous, damnèd Dane."" The King dies. Laertes, dying, exchanges forgiveness with Hamlet, absolving him of his and his father's death. Laertes dies. Hamlet, feeling the poison, begs Horatio not to commit suicide with the remaining poisoned wine but to live and tell his story to the ""unsatisfied."" Hamlet utters his last words, ""The rest is silence,"" and dies. The play concludes with a Dead March."
Jane Eyre-Charlotte Brontë,"The narrative begins on a cold winter day at Gateshead Hall, where the narrator, Jane Eyre, is excluded from the family circle by her aunt, Mrs. Reed, due to Jane's supposed unsociable and childlike disposition. Mrs. Reed's own children, Eliza, John, and Georgiana, are with her, seemingly happy. Jane retreats to the breakfast-room, finding solace in a picture-book, ""Bewick's History of British Birds,"" hidden in a window-seat. Her older cousin, John Reed, discovers her, bullies her, and eventually strikes her. When Jane, in a rare outburst, retaliates by calling him a ""wicked and cruel boy,"" John throws the book at her, injuring her head. Mrs. Reed, alerted by her daughters, becomes enraged by Jane's defiance and orders her confined to the red-room, a seldom-used chamber where Jane's uncle, Mr. Reed, had died.

In the red-room, Jane is terrified by the eerie atmosphere and her own reflection, fueled by superstitious thoughts. She reflects on her miserable life at Gateshead, remembering her uncle's deathbed promise to Mrs. Reed to raise Jane as her own child, a promise Jane believes Mrs. Reed resents. Jane fears her uncle's ghost may be troubled by her mistreatment. A mysterious light and a sound send her into a panic, causing her to scream and shake the door. Bessie, the nurse, and Miss Abbot, the lady's maid, come to her aid, but Mrs. Reed, arriving soon after, dismisses Jane's distress as artifice and extends her punishment. Overwhelmed, Jane loses consciousness.

She awakens in her own bed, attended by Bessie and a kind apothecary, Mr. Lloyd, who is a stranger to the family. Jane feels a sense of relief in his presence. She overhears Bessie and another servant discussing ghostly tales and Mrs. Reed's harshness. The next day, still weak and unhappy, Jane is unable to find joy even in Bessie's unexpected kindness or her favorite books. Bessie sings a mournful ballad about an orphan, deepening Jane's melancholy. Mr. Lloyd returns and, after Jane confesses her misery stems from being ""knocked down"" by John and imprisoned in the ""haunted"" red-room, he questions her about her family. Jane reveals her parents are dead and she has no known relations beyond the Reeds, whom she dislikes. She expresses a strong desire to go to school, seeing it as an escape. That night, Jane overhears Bessie and Miss Abbot discussing her history: her father was a poor clergyman, her mother disinherited by her rich father for marrying him, and both died of typhus a year later, leaving Jane an orphan. The servants remark on Jane's plainness and Mrs. Reed's eagerness to be rid of her.

Weeks later, Mr. Brocklehurst, the rigid and austere manager of Lowood School, visits Gateshead. Mrs. Reed, in Jane's presence, informs him of Jane's supposed ""tendency to deceit"" and requests strict supervision. Mr. Brocklehurst, who believes in mortifying pride and luxury, agrees to admit Jane to Lowood, specifying that she will stay there for all vacations. After he leaves, Jane, enraged by Mrs. Reed's false accusations, vehemently confronts her aunt, declaring her hatred and revealing Mrs. Reed's cruelty. Mrs. Reed is shaken. Jane feels a fleeting triumph, followed by remorse, but ultimately resolves to pursue her independence. Bessie finds Jane later, somewhat cross, but then kind, confirming Jane's imminent departure for Lowood and sharing details about the Reed family's current troubles: John Reed has ruined himself and is dead (possibly by suicide), causing Mrs. Reed to suffer a stroke, and Eliza and Georgiana are constantly quarreling. Bessie also reveals that Jane's paternal uncle, Mr. Eyre from Madeira, visited Gateshead years ago, but Mrs. Reed turned him away, falsely claiming Jane was at school far off. Jane and Bessie share an emotional farewell.

Jane travels by coach to Lowood, a journey that feels preternaturally long. Upon arrival, she meets Miss Temple, the kind and dignified superintendent, who shows her compassion. Jane is introduced to the bleak, strict routine of the charity-school, where girls wear plain uniforms, endure minimal food (often burnt porridge), and suffer from extreme cold. Miss Temple, however, defies Mr. Brocklehurst's strictures by ordering a lunch of bread and cheese when breakfast is inedible. Jane befriends Helen Burns, an older girl who endures constant, undeserved punishment and humiliation from Miss Scatcherd, a harsh teacher. Helen displays remarkable patience, humility, and a Christian philosophy of enduring suffering and loving one's enemies, which Jane, with her fiery spirit, struggles to comprehend.

During a public inspection, Mr. Brocklehurst criticizes Miss Temple's minor indulgences and orders girls' naturally curly hair to be cut short to curb ""worldly sentiment."" Jane accidentally drops her slate, drawing Mr. Brocklehurst's attention. He forces her to stand on a stool before the entire school and publicly denounces her as a liar and an ""alien"" based on Mrs. Reed's accusations, warning all to shun her. Helen, despite her own recent flogging, offers Jane a comforting smile. Jane sinks into despair, but Helen's calm wisdom helps her. Miss Temple, believing Jane, writes to Mr. Lloyd, the apothecary, for corroboration. When his reply confirms Jane's innocence, Miss Temple publicly clears Jane's name, bringing Jane immense relief and renewed determination.

Lowood's harsh winter conditions, however, lead to a typhus fever epidemic. Many girls fall ill and die, including Helen Burns, who succumbs to consumption in Miss Temple's room. Jane secretly visits Helen on her deathbed, where Helen expresses her peaceful acceptance of death and her faith in God. Jane is devastated by Helen's death but finds solace in her spiritual strength. The epidemic draws public attention to Lowood, leading to an inquiry that exposes Mr. Brocklehurst's mismanagement and the school's unhealthy conditions. Wealthy benefactors intervene, improving the school's facilities, diet, and rules. Jane remains at Lowood for eight more years, six as a pupil and two as a teacher, excelling in her studies and finding an excellent education.

After eight years, Miss Temple marries a clergyman and leaves Lowood. Jane, feeling a profound loss and a renewed longing for liberty and a wider world, resolves to seek a new situation. She advertises for a governess position and receives a reply from Mrs. Fairfax of Thornfield. Before leaving Lowood, Bessie visits, revealing that Jane's aunt, Mrs. Reed, is dying, and that John Reed has committed suicide, leaving the family in financial distress. Bessie also mentions that Jane's uncle, Mr. Eyre, had sought her at Gateshead years ago.

Jane travels to Thornfield, a large, old manor house. She is kindly received by Mrs. Fairfax, the housekeeper, who she initially mistakes for the mistress. Mrs. Fairfax clarifies that she is merely the manager and that the owner is Mr. Rochester, and Jane's pupil, Adèle, is his ward. Adèle, a lively French child, was brought to England by Mr. Rochester after her mother, a French opera-dancer named Céline Varens (Mr. Rochester's former mistress), abandoned her. Jane begins teaching Adèle in the library. During a tour of the house, Jane hears a strange, mirthless laugh from the third storey, which Mrs. Fairfax attributes to Grace Poole, a servant. Jane also overhears other servants discussing Grace Poole's unusually high wages, hinting at a secret known to Mr. Rochester.

Mr. Rochester returns to Thornfield after an accident where his horse slipped on ice. Jane realizes he was the stranger she helped on her walk to Hay Lane. Mr. Rochester, a dark, stern, yet charismatic man, invites Jane and Adèle to tea. He quizzes Jane, finding her unusually direct and intelligent. He reveals details about Céline Varens and Adèle, stating he took Adèle in as a charitable act, not because she is his daughter. He implies a troubled past and a desire for a new, purer life. That night, Jane is awakened by a ""demoniac laugh"" and finds Mr. Rochester's bed curtains on fire. She extinguishes the flames. Mr. Rochester, shaken, tells her it was Grace Poole and that he has ""found it all out,"" but he enjoins Jane to secrecy. He then leaves to make arrangements.

The next morning, Jane observes Grace Poole, who appears completely calm despite Jane's belief that she attempted murder. Jane's attempts to elicit information from Grace fail. Mr. Rochester returns with guests, including the beautiful and accomplished Blanche Ingram, whom Mrs. Fairfax believes Mr. Rochester intends to marry. Jane, despite her growing feelings for Mr. Rochester, forces herself to accept this apparent reality, reminding herself of her subordinate position. During the guests' stay, they play charades, and Jane observes Mr. Rochester's deep engagement with Miss Ingram. Jane also notices Blanche's disdain for Adèle and her own shallow character. Jane realizes Mr. Rochester intends to marry Blanche for social and financial reasons, but not for love.

During one charade, a guest named Mr. Mason arrives from the West Indies. Mr. Rochester is visibly disturbed by his presence. Later, a ""gipsy"" (Mr. Rochester in disguise) tells the fortunes of the ladies. Blanche Ingram returns from her session looking disappointed, while other ladies are startled by the gipsy's accurate insights. Jane is then summoned. The ""gipsy"" reveals an uncanny knowledge of Jane's character and her secret hopes. During their exchange, Jane realizes the gipsy is Mr. Rochester. As they speak, Jane tells him that Mr. Mason has arrived. Mr. Rochester becomes gravely distressed upon hearing Mason's name, confirming a deep connection to Mason and the West Indies. He sends Jane to observe Mason and then has Mason come to the library.

Later that night, Jane is awakened by a terrifying scream, struggle, and a call for ""Rochester!"" from the third storey. The entire household is aroused. Mr. Rochester calms his guests, dismissing the incident as a servant's nightmare, but Jane knows he is lying. He secretly enlists Jane's help, taking her to a hidden room on the third floor. There, she finds Mr. Mason, seriously wounded and bleeding from an attack. Mr. Rochester instructs Jane to tend to Mason, while he fetches a surgeon. Mason whispers that ""she"" (Bertha) bit him like a ""tigress."" Jane realizes the ""murderess"" is the same woman responsible for the fire. Mr. Rochester returns with the surgeon, Mr. Carter, who confirms Mason's wounds were caused by teeth. Mr. Rochester quickly arranges for Mason to be removed from Thornfield before dawn, warning him to forget the incident and be cautious. He thanks Jane for saving his life and expresses a profound, but still ambiguous, affection.

The next morning, Jane and Mr. Rochester meet in the orchard. He speaks cryptically about his troubled past and then proposes a hypothetical scenario about a man who, burdened by a past ""error,"" finds regeneration with a ""stranger"" (Jane) and wishes to overcome ""conventional impediment"" to be with her. Jane, feeling the weight of his words, advises a sinner's reformation should come from God, not a human. He then reveals his intention to marry Miss Ingram and offers Jane a new governess post in Ireland. Jane, heartbroken by the prospect of separation, confesses her love for him. Mr. Rochester, overjoyed, then confesses his love for her, revealing his courtship of Blanche was a ruse to make Jane jealous and that he has no bride other than Jane. He asks her to marry him, and she accepts. As they embrace, a violent thunderstorm breaks, striking the chestnut tree in the orchard, splitting it in two. Mrs. Fairfax sees them entering the house and looks shocked.

The next day, Jane, feeling radiant, meets Mr. Rochester. He confirms their wedding will be in four weeks and plans to lavish her with jewels and travel. Jane resists the extravagant gifts, preferring simplicity, and playfully argues with him about his ""oriental"" view of women. She recalls her uncle's letter, indicating a potential inheritance, and resolves to write to him to secure her independence. She continues to assert her will, teasing Mr. Rochester, who enjoys their verbal sparring.

On the morning of their wedding, Mr. Rochester impatiently rushes Jane to the church. As the ceremony begins, Mr. Briggs, a solicitor, steps forward, declaring an ""insuperable impediment"": Mr. Rochester is already married. Mr. Briggs produces documents proving Mr. Rochester married Bertha Antoinetta Mason in Jamaica fifteen years ago, and then produces Mr. Mason, Bertha's brother, as a witness, who confirms Bertha is alive and living at Thornfield Hall. Mr. Rochester, after a moment of fury, admits the truth, stating that Bertha is mad and comes from a mad family. He reveals that his father and brother had tricked him into marrying her for her fortune. He describes Bertha's depravity and violent insanity. He then leads everyone to the third storey, where Bertha is kept in a locked room. She is a large, dishevelled woman with a ""purple face"" and ""bloated features,"" who attacks Mr. Rochester with ""virile force,"" biting his cheek, before he restrains her. He then challenges the guests to judge him.

After this horrifying revelation, Mr. Briggs informs Jane that her uncle, John Eyre of Madeira, is dead and has left her his entire fortune. He explains that Mrs. Reed had falsely told Mr. Eyre that Jane was dead, preventing her from inheriting earlier. Mr. Briggs and Mr. Mason depart. Jane, devastated by Mr. Rochester's deception and the reality of his marriage, feels all her hopes are dead. Despite her deep love for him, her principles compel her to leave Thornfield immediately. That night, after a heart-wrenching confrontation where Mr. Rochester begs her to stay and live with him as his wife (despite his existing marriage), Jane reaffirms her love but asserts her independent will, refusing to become his mistress. She tells him she must leave him for her ""whole life."" After a final embrace and farewell, Jane slips away from Thornfield in the middle of the night with only twenty shillings, leaving behind her wedding dress and gifts.

She walks for two days, destitute and starving, until she collapses on the doorstep of a cottage on the moor. She is taken in by the Rivers family: Diana, Mary, and their brother, St. John. They show her kindness, and Jane, using the alias ""Jane Elliott,"" recovers her strength. The Rivers sisters become her beloved friends, and St. John, a clergyman, offers her the position of schoolmistress at a new village school for poor girls in Morton, which she accepts.

Soon after, St. John reveals that their uncle, John Eyre, has died and bequeathed his entire fortune of twenty thousand pounds to his brother the clergyman's orphan daughter. St. John, recognizing Jane's handwriting on a slip of paper from her discarded portfolio (which he found during his work for Mr. Briggs), realizes Jane Eyre is his cousin and the true heiress. Jane, delighted to find family, insists on dividing the inheritance equally among the four cousins, giving each five thousand pounds. St. John reluctantly agrees.

St. John, a man of intense ambition and religious zeal, tells Jane of his intention to become a missionary in India. He falls in love with Rosamond Oliver, the beautiful daughter of a wealthy local factory owner, but suppresses his feelings, believing she is not suited to be a missionary's wife. He eventually tells Jane that Rosamond is engaged to another man. St. John then proposes to Jane, not out of love, but because he believes her firm character, diligence, and selflessness would make her an ideal missionary's wife and helper. He urges her to join him in India, arguing it is God's will. Jane, though deeply valuing him as a brother and feeling his powerful influence, refuses to marry him, knowing she does not love him as a husband and would be merely a ""useful tool.""

During a moment of intense spiritual struggle while St. John is trying to convince her, Jane hears a disembodied voice crying, ""Jane! Jane! Jane!"" She recognizes it as Mr. Rochester's. This mysterious summons convinces her that she must return to him. She breaks from St. John's influence, resolves to find Mr. Rochester, and departs from Moor House.

Jane travels back to Thornfield, only to find the Hall a blackened ruin. At a local inn, she learns from the former butler that a fire had destroyed Thornfield Hall. Mr. Rochester's mad wife, Bertha, set the fire after escaping from Grace Poole's care (due to Poole's drinking). Bertha then climbed to the roof and, in a fit of madness, jumped to her death. Mr. Rochester, in his efforts to save the servants and Bertha, suffered severe injuries: he lost sight in both eyes and one of his hands. He is now blind and a cripple, living in isolation at Ferndean Manor, a remote estate, attended only by old John and his wife.

Jane immediately goes to Ferndean. She finds Mr. Rochester broken but still recognizably himself. He is surprised and disbelieving at her presence, at first thinking she is a dream. Jane assures him she is real and has returned to him. She reveals her inheritance, making her financially independent. She tells him she will stay with him as his companion, nurse, and guide, offering to be his ""eyes and hands."" Despite his physical infirmities and his belief that he is an unworthy ruin, Jane reassures him of her love. He asks her to marry him again, and this time, she accepts with a full heart, recognizing that she can now truly be useful to him and that their love is stronger than all obstacles. He confesses that he had called out her name in despair on the very night she heard his voice.

Jane and Mr. Rochester have a quiet wedding with only the parson and clerk present. Jane's cousins, Diana and Mary, approve of her marriage, while St. John never replies to her letter but maintains a spiritual correspondence. Jane brings Adèle from her strict school and places her in a more indulgent one, fostering her happiness and development.

Ten years later, Jane and Edward Rochester are supremely happy in their marriage. He regained sight in one eye after two years, and can now dimly perceive light and find his way. When their first son is born, he can see that the boy has inherited his former ""large, brilliant, and black"" eyes. Jane continues to be his ""vision"" and ""right hand."" Diana and Mary Rivers are both happily married. St. John Rivers went to India as a dedicated missionary, where he continues his tireless work, unmarried, and is expected to die soon, anticipating his reward in heaven. Jane concludes her story, reflecting on her enduring love and happiness with Edward."
Madame Bovary-Gustave Flaubert,"The story begins in a school classroom with the introduction of a new, awkward country boy named Charles Bovary, about fifteen years old. He struggles to pronounce his name, ""Charbovari,"" which amuses his classmates. Charles is diligent but lacks polish in his studies. His father, Monsieur Charles Denis Bartolome Bovary, a former assistant-surgeon-major, had squandered his wife's dowry and retired to the country, becoming embittered. His mother, once affectionate, became stoic and managed the household. Charles was sent to school late, then studied medicine in Rouen, initially working hard but later becoming idle, spending time in public-houses and engaging in romantic liaisons. He eventually passed his examination after five years and established a medical practice in Tostes.

Charles's mother found him a wife, Heloise, the forty-five-year-old widow of a bailiff, who had a modest income but was unattractive and controlling. She complained constantly and monitored Charles. One night, Charles is called to the Bertaux farm to set Monsieur Rouault's broken leg. There, he meets Emma, Monsieur Rouault's young daughter, and is struck by her delicate hands and frank eyes. Charles frequently returns to the farm, finding pleasure in Emma's company, much to the jealousy of his wife, Heloise. Heloise's financial deceptions are revealed, and after a confrontation with Charles's parents, she suffers a hemorrhage and dies. Charles mourns her sincerely.

Old Rouault visits Charles, pays him for his services, and consoles him, suggesting he visit the Bertaux. Charles does, and is drawn to Emma. He covertly proposes marriage to Monsieur Rouault, who, eager to marry off his daughter for financial reasons, agrees and signals Emma's consent by opening a window shutter. Charles and Emma's wedding is a grand affair, lasting sixteen hours, attended by numerous relatives. Charles is overtly affectionate with Emma, but she, dreaming of romantic ideals from books and convent life, finds the expected happiness elusive. She secretly yearns for a life of luxury and passion, contrasting it with Charles's commonplace nature.

Emma tries to improve their home in Tostes and Charles buys her a dog-cart. She is frustrated by Charles's lack of ambition and unrefined habits. His mother visits, criticizing Emma's perceived extravagance, leading to arguments. Emma attempts to generate love for Charles by reciting poetry but feels nothing. She grows bored and suffers from ennui, lamenting her monotonous life in the country. She receives an invitation to a ball at the Marquis d’Andervilliers' château, which excites her greatly. At the ball, Emma is enchanted by the luxury and sophisticated guests, particularly a Viscount with whom she waltzes, experiencing a moment of intimacy. She later feels her past life fading in comparison to this dream-like experience. On the return journey, Charles finds a cigar-case belonging to the Viscount; Emma confiscates it and hides it. The ball leaves a profound ""hole in her life,"" becoming an obsession.

Emma immerses herself in Parisian journals and romantic novels, dreaming of an exciting, passionate life in the city, which she contrasts with the ""mediocrity"" of Yonville. She replaces her old servant with a young orphan, Félicité, and tries to mold her into a lady's maid. She decorates her home with new items, which Charles, though not understanding, appreciates. Emma grows increasingly irritated by Charles's coarse habits and lack of understanding. She expresses contempt for everything and everyone, shocking Charles. Her health declines, marked by pallor, heart palpitations, and fits of torpor, which Charles attributes to her nervous illness. He decides to move to Yonville-l’Abbaye, a larger market town. Before leaving Tostes, Emma finds a wire from her first bridal bouquet and burns it, symbolizing the end of that chapter. They move to Yonville; Emma is pregnant.

In Yonville, Charles and Emma meet Monsieur Homais, the chemist, a verbose and self-important rationalist who views all priests as hypocrites. Homais, having once been reprimanded for practicing medicine without a diploma, seeks to befriend Charles to avoid future scrutiny. Emma gives birth to a daughter, Berthe, but faints upon learning the baby is a girl, having hoped for a son to embody her dreams of freedom. She struggles to choose a name, eventually settling on Berthe after a young lady at Vaubyessard. During the christening dinner, Charles's drunken father offends the Curé. Emma briefly bonds with Charles's father, who flirts with her, but Charles's mother, fearing a bad influence, makes him leave.

Emma, feeling lonely and disillusioned, takes Berthe to her wet-nurse, Mere Rollet, and is accompanied by Léon Dupuis, a notary's clerk. Emma and Léon discover a shared romantic sensibility and a mutual attraction, but Léon is too timid to act. Emma feels stifled by Charles's presence and her provincial life, resenting his happiness with her. She begins to appear more virtuous, attending church, focusing on housework, and doting on Berthe, which delights Charles but hides her inner turmoil and growing love for Léon. Léon, perceiving her as inaccessible, idealizes her.

Monsieur Lheureux, a shrewd draper and moneylender, visits Emma, tempting her with expensive goods on credit and offering to lend her money. Emma buys a new wardrobe and other luxuries, funded by bills of exchange, some of which Charles unknowingly signs. Her affair with Léon deepens, becoming a series of clandestine rendezvous in Rouen, during which she neglects her responsibilities. She lies to Charles about piano lessons to justify her weekly trips. Léon, initially thrilled, soon finds Emma's demands and emotional intensity burdensome, and his affection wanes. He is warned by his employer and an anonymous letter from his mother about his compromising relationship. He feels stifled by Emma's needs and the ""platitudes of marriage"" appearing in their affair. Emma, in turn, finds Léon less heroic than her imaginary lovers.

Emma's debts mount, and Lheureux, now her ""banker,"" presents her with a summons for 8,000 francs. Desperate, Emma first appeals to Lheureux, who threatens to expose her ""little theft"" (signing bills without Charles's knowledge) and reveals he already discounted them with a broker. She then seeks help from Léon, begging him for three thousand francs. He, too, cannot provide the money. Emma, in despair, visits Monsieur Guillaumin, the notary, hoping for a loan. Guillaumin, however, makes sexual advances toward her, which she angrily rejects.

Utterly desperate, Emma returns to Yonville. She goes to the chemist's shop and manipulates Justin, the apprentice, into giving her the key to Homais's private laboratory, the ""Capharnaum."" There, she finds a jar of arsenic and consumes it. Charles returns home to news of the distraint and discovers Emma has poisoned herself. He reads her suicide note, ""Accuse no one.""

Doctors Canivet and Lariviere are called but can do nothing. Emma suffers agonizing convulsions, vomiting blood, and screaming. As she lies dying, the blind beggar's song is heard outside, triggering a final, frantic, despairing laugh from Emma before she dies.

Charles is distraught, refusing to believe she's gone. Homais and Canivet drag him from the room. Homais, ever concerned with his reputation, invents a story that Emma mistook arsenic for sugar while making a vanilla cream and writes an article for the local paper. Charles insists Emma be buried in her wedding dress, with three coffins, and a piece of green velvet. He quarrels with Homais and the priest over the details. He blasphemes against God, consumed by grief.

At the wake, Homais and the Curé argue about religion and philosophy, then fall asleep. Charles comes for a last farewell, lifting her veil, and screams in horror at her face. Homais cuts a lock of Emma's hair for Charles.

The funeral takes place. Charles, attempting a brave front, walks at the head of the procession. Old Rouault faints at the sight of the coffin. At the graveside, Charles throws handfuls of earth, crying ""Adieu!"" He is eventually led away. Justin is found weeping on Emma's grave, and Lestiboudois, the gravedigger, realizes he is the one who has been stealing his potatoes.

After Emma's death, Charles is overwhelmed by debt. Lheureux harasses him, and others demand payment for Emma's secret expenses. Charles refuses to sell any of her belongings. His mother leaves him after a quarrel. Félicité, the servant, eventually runs away with Charles's remaining clothes.

Charles receives news of Léon's marriage. He later finds Rodolphe's breakup letter in Emma's desk and Rodolphe's portrait. He realizes Emma had lovers but interprets their relationship as ""platonic,"" shrinking from the full truth. He adopts Emma's tastes, wearing white cravats and patent leather boots, and even signing notes of hand, becoming corrupted by her influence beyond the grave. He sells off his possessions piece by piece to pay debts.

Charles and Berthe live in poverty. He tries to care for Berthe but is too despondent. Homais, meanwhile, builds his reputation by attacking new doctors and advocating for ""progress."" He successfully has the blind beggar confined to an asylum. Homais writes a book and yearns for the cross of the Legion of Honour, eventually achieving it through political maneuvering.

Charles, impoverished and neglected, finally encounters Rodolphe at a market. He sees Emma's face in Rodolphe's, wishes he were Rodolphe, and is consumed by a ""sombre fury"" that quickly fades to weary lassitude. He tells Rodolphe, ""I don't blame you now,"" adding, ""It is the fault of fatality!"" The next day, Berthe finds Charles dead in the arbour, clutching a tress of Emma's black hair. A post-mortem finds nothing. Berthe is sent to her grandmother, who soon dies, then to an aunt, who sends her to work in a cotton-factory. Monsieur Homais, the chemist, flourishes in Yonville and eventually receives the Legion of Honour."
Mrs. Dalloway-Virginia Woolf,"The story begins on a beautiful June morning in London as Clarissa Dalloway, a high-society woman over fifty, prepares for a party she is hosting that evening. Deciding to buy the flowers herself, she walks through Westminster, reflecting on her past and present. She recalls her youth at Bourton, remembering moments of profound feeling and her complex relationship with Peter Walsh, an old friend who is expected back from India. She chose not to marry Peter, opting for her husband Richard Dalloway, believing Peter's intensity would have destroyed them both. She remembers the pain of hearing Peter married a woman in India and dismisses her rival as a ""flimsy nincompoop,"" though Peter had claimed happiness despite his life's perceived failures.

Clarissa then encounters Hugh Whitbread, another old acquaintance, in the park. He informs her his wife, Evelyn, is ill. Clarissa feels a familiar sense of inadequacy beside Hugh, but also a lingering attachment. She internally contrasts Hugh with Peter, who always criticized Hugh's superficiality. Arriving at the florist's, Mulberry's, Clarissa is momentarily soothed by the flowers. Suddenly, a violent ""pistol shot"" from a motor car stopping outside the shop startles her.

The motor car causes a stir among passers-by, who briefly glimpse a ""face of the very greatest importance"" before the blinds are drawn. Rumors circulate about whether it is the Prince of Wales, the Queen, or the Prime Minister. Among the onlookers is Septimus Warren Smith, a pale, thirty-year-old war veteran. He is terrified by the car, perceiving it as a terrifying, static entity, and feels as if he is blocking the way. His young Italian wife, Lucrezia (Rezia), tries to coax him to move, worried because Septimus has been threatening to kill himself. Clarissa, leaving the shop, assumes the car contains the Queen. The car's passing creates a deep emotional ripple through the city, reminding people of war, empire, and death.

Septimus and Rezia later sit in Regent's Park. Dr. Holmes, who is treating Septimus, has advised Rezia to make her husband take an interest in external things. When an aeroplane appears, writing smoke letters in the sky, Septimus interprets them as personal signals of ""beauty,"" filling him with tears. Rezia, however, tells him it's merely advertising ""toffee."" Septimus's mental state deteriorates further, experiencing hallucinations where trees become alive and the human voice causes immense physical and emotional pain. Rezia, overwhelmed by his apparent madness and the strain of his condition (Dr. Holmes has insisted there's nothing seriously wrong), wishes he were dead and feels utterly alone. Septimus believes his wedding ring slipping from Rezia's hand symbolizes the end of their marriage and his newfound freedom. He experiences divine revelations: ""trees are alive,"" ""there is no crime,"" ""universal love,"" and believes his dead friend Evans is communicating with him. Rezia, terrified, sends for Dr. Holmes again. Septimus, seeing Dr. Holmes enter, perceives him as ""human nature,"" a ""brute with the red nostrils.""

Meanwhile, Peter Walsh arrives at Clarissa's house, unannounced, after five years in India. Clarissa is surprised and emotional. Peter observes she has aged but finds her ""heavenly."" He reveals he is in love with a married woman in India, the wife of a Major (Daisy), and is in London to consult lawyers for her divorce. Clarissa, though dismissive of Daisy, is affected by Peter's declaration. She takes his hand and, for a moment, imagines the ""gaiety"" she might have had if she had married him. However, the moment passes, and she feels her life is ""over."" Peter, overcome with emotion, bursts into tears. Elizabeth, Clarissa's daughter, enters, and Peter, without fully saying goodbye to Clarissa, quickly departs. Clarissa calls out for him to remember her party.

Peter wanders through London, reflecting on Clarissa's ""coldness"" and ""conventionality"" and his own ""failure"" compared to the Dalloways. He is overcome by a sense of emptiness after Clarissa's refusal. He thinks of their painful past, particularly Clarissa's ""death of the soul"" moment at Bourton when she reacted with prudishness to a remark about an unmarried mother. He also recalls the moment he realized she would marry Richard Dalloway. He is still intensely jealous of Richard. He chases a young woman through the streets, an escapade he later acknowledges was ""half made up."" He decides to go to Clarissa's party, partly to question Richard about India.

Septimus and Rezia visit Sir William Bradshaw, a distinguished nerve specialist. Sir William quickly diagnoses Septimus with ""complete breakdown"" and a lack of ""sense of proportion."" He recommends a long rest in a country home, implying separation from Rezia. Rezia is distraught, but Sir William insists it is necessary, even a matter of law, if Septimus threatens suicide. Septimus perceives Holmes and Bradshaw as persecutors, ""the rack and the thumbscrew."" He feels utterly alone, on the edge of the world.

Back at their lodging, Septimus asks Rezia the name of Mrs. Filmer's married daughter, for whom Rezia is making a hat. For the first time in days, he speaks normally, even joking about the hat. They share a moment of private happiness, laughing together. Septimus feels a ""coverlet of flowers"" over him, a sense of peace. Rezia is overjoyed. However, the momentary peace is shattered when Dr. Holmes arrives again. Rezia tries to prevent him from entering, but Holmes, a ""powerfully built man,"" pushes past her. Septimus, seeing Holmes at the door, cries, ""I’ll give it you!"" and flings himself out of the window onto the area railings, killing himself. Rezia witnesses it, understanding instantly. Dr. Holmes, shaken, dismisses it as a ""sudden impulse.""

At Clarissa's party, guests arrive, including Sally Seton (now Lady Rosseter), who is delighted to see Clarissa and remembers their youth. The Prime Minister also attends, a symbol of English society. While conversing with Lady Bradshaw, Clarissa learns that ""a young man ... had killed himself."" The news shatters Clarissa's enjoyment of the party. She retreats to a small room, profoundly affected by the death. She despises the Bradshaws for discussing such a tragedy at her party and for their chilling, professional detachment. She imagines the young man's gruesome death. She contrasts his act of ""defiance"" and ""attempt to communicate"" with her own compromises in life. She feels ""very like him,"" the young man who killed himself, and is ""glad that he had done it; thrown it away."" The clock strikes, and she sees an old lady in the house opposite putting out her light, feeling a sense of solemn privacy. Clarissa, renewed by this profound experience, decides she must return to her party, to Sally and Peter.

Peter, still at the party, sits with Sally. He asks where Clarissa has gone. He is filled with ""terror"" and ""ecstasy,"" realizing the source of his excitement is Clarissa herself. ""For there she was."" The story ends with Clarissa returning to her guests."
Pride and Prejudice-Jane Austen,"The plot of ""Pride and Prejudice"" begins with the established truth that a single man of good fortune is in want of a wife. This societal expectation sets the stage for the arrival of Mr. Bingley, a wealthy young man from the north of England, who leases Netherfield Park. Mrs. Bennet, whose primary goal in life is to marry off her five daughters, is immediately determined that one of them should secure Mr. Bingley. Despite her husband, Mr. Bennet's, teasing and sarcastic remarks, he secretly visits Mr. Bingley first.

The Bennet daughters soon learn of Mr. Bingley's visit when Mr. Bennet playfully reveals it to Elizabeth (Lizzy). Mrs. Bennet is overjoyed, believing she has successfully urged her husband to make the acquaintance. The family eagerly anticipates Mr. Bingley's return visit, which occurs a few days later, though he only sees Mr. Bennet. The ladies of the house observe him from a window. An invitation to dinner is sent, but Mr. Bingley declines, stating he must go to London. Later, it is reported that Mr. Bingley will bring a large party to the upcoming assembly.

At the Meryton assembly, Mr. Bingley, who is amiable and lively, is accompanied by his two sisters, his brother-in-law Mr. Hurst, and his friend, Mr. Darcy. Mr. Darcy is a tall, handsome man of great fortune (ten thousand a year) from Derbyshire, but his proud and reserved manners quickly make him disliked by most of the company, especially after he refuses to dance with many ladies and is overheard dismissing Elizabeth as ""tolerable, but not handsome enough to tempt _me_."" In contrast, Mr. Bingley dances twice with Jane Bennet, the eldest and most beautiful Bennet daughter, showing clear admiration for her. Mrs. Bennet is delighted by Jane's success but deeply offended by Mr. Darcy's rudeness and slighting of Elizabeth. Elizabeth, despite her spirited nature, is displeased with Mr. Darcy.

Elizabeth and Jane discuss the ball, with Jane expressing her admiration for Mr. Bingley, while Elizabeth, who is more discerning, notes the pride and conceit of Mr. Bingley's sisters. Elizabeth also begins to notice Mr. Darcy's attention shifting towards her, finding her intelligence and playfulness intriguing despite his initial disdain. During a social gathering at Sir William Lucas's house, Elizabeth playfully challenges Mr. Darcy, leading to an exchange of witty, though sharp, remarks about their characters. Mr. Darcy confesses his pride is well-regulated, and Elizabeth suggests his defect is a ""propensity to hate everybody,"" to which he retorts that hers is ""wilfully to misunderstand them."" Miss Bingley, jealous of Darcy's attention to Elizabeth, attempts to provoke him against her by criticizing Elizabeth's low connections, but Darcy's interest in Elizabeth persists.

Jane falls ill after riding to Netherfield in the rain, a situation engineered by Mrs. Bennet to prolong her stay. Elizabeth walks three miles through the mud to Netherfield to nurse her sister, which earns her contempt from Miss Bingley and Mrs. Hurst but kindness from Mr. Bingley. Darcy, though reserved, is observed to be admiring Elizabeth's ""fine eyes"" brightened by exercise. During Elizabeth's stay, the Bingley sisters continue to criticize Elizabeth's manners and family, while Darcy makes a remark about low connections lessening one's chance of marrying well. Jane slowly recovers.

News arrives that the local militia regiment, which includes the charming Mr. Wickham, will be stationed in Meryton, much to the delight of the younger Bennet girls, Kitty and Lydia, who are obsessed with officers. At a subsequent social gathering at Mrs. Philips's house (Mrs. Bennet's sister), Mr. Wickham is introduced to the Bennet sisters. He quickly captivates Elizabeth with his agreeable manners and a story about Mr. Darcy's injustice towards him. Wickham claims that the late Mr. Darcy, his godfather, intended to provide him with a valuable living (a church position), but the present Mr. Darcy denied him this inheritance, alleging Wickham's extravagance. Wickham also reveals that Mr. Darcy's aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, intends for Darcy to marry her daughter, Miss de Bourgh. Elizabeth is deeply angered by Darcy's supposed cruelty and believes Wickham's account.

Meanwhile, Mr. Collins, Mr. Bennet's cousin and the entailer of the Longbourn estate, arrives for a visit. He is a pompous clergyman under the patronage of Lady Catherine de Bourgh. He announces his intention to marry one of the Bennet daughters as ""amends"" for inheriting their estate. After Mrs. Bennet hints that Jane is soon to be engaged, Mr. Collins shifts his attentions to Elizabeth. He proposes to her with a long, self-important speech, listing his reasons for marriage and his connections to Lady Catherine. Elizabeth, disgusted, firmly rejects him, but he misinterprets her refusal as female coyness. Mrs. Bennet, furious, insists Elizabeth accept, but Mr. Bennet, finding the situation amusing, declares Elizabeth must choose: her mother will never see her again if she does *not* marry Mr. Collins, and he will never see her again if she *does*. Elizabeth's refusal stands. Mr. Collins, then, promptly proposes to Elizabeth's intimate friend, Charlotte Lucas, who, to Elizabeth's shock and dismay, accepts him out of a pragmatic desire for a secure establishment.

The Bingley family abruptly leaves Netherfield for London, with Caroline Bingley's letter to Jane implying that Mr. Bingley has no intention of returning and that he is being steered towards marrying Miss Darcy. Jane is heartbroken, though she tries to maintain her good opinion of Caroline. Elizabeth, however, is convinced that Bingley's sisters and Mr. Darcy are deliberately separating Bingley from Jane due to the Bennets' lower social connections. Elizabeth herself learns from Mrs. Gardiner that Mr. Wickham has shifted his attentions to a Miss King, who has recently inherited a fortune, which Elizabeth, to her own surprise, finds a pragmatic and understandable choice for a man in Wickham's circumstances. Elizabeth visits Charlotte at Hunsford, near Lady Catherine's estate, Rosings. During her stay, she frequently encounters Mr. Darcy and his cousin, Colonel Fitzwilliam. Colonel Fitzwilliam inadvertently reveals that Mr. Darcy ""saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage,"" which Elizabeth immediately understands to be Bingley and Jane, confirming her suspicions of Darcy's interference.

Later, Mr. Darcy unexpectedly calls on Elizabeth and proposes marriage, but in a manner that emphasizes her social inferiority and the degradation of the match for him. Elizabeth, incensed by his pride and his admitted role in separating Jane and Bingley, and fueled by Wickham's earlier account, vehemently rejects him. She accuses him of ruining Jane's happiness and cruelly treating Mr. Wickham. Darcy, shocked, confesses his actions regarding Bingley were motivated by his belief in Jane's indifference and his desire to save his friend from the social disadvantages of the Bennet family's lack of propriety. To defend himself against Wickham's accusations, Darcy then gives Elizabeth a letter detailing Wickham's true character: Wickham squandered his inheritance, tried to extort more money from Darcy, and attempted to elope with Darcy's fifteen-year-old sister, Georgiana, for her thirty-thousand-pound fortune.

Elizabeth is initially skeptical but, upon re-reading the letter and reflecting on Wickham's inconsistencies and her own past prejudices, realizes the truth. She is deeply ashamed of her blindness, partiality, and vanity. She now understands that Darcy's intervention regarding Jane and Bingley was based on a genuine concern, however misguided, about Jane's apparent indifference and her family's social blunders. She also feels profound shame for her family's conduct.

Elizabeth, along with her aunt and uncle Gardiner, embarks on a tour of Derbyshire, which includes a visit to Pemberley, Mr. Darcy's estate. Having ascertained that Mr. Darcy is absent, Elizabeth agrees to the visit. She is deeply impressed by the beauty of Pemberley and the high esteem in which Mr. Darcy is held by his housekeeper, Mrs. Reynolds, who describes him as a kind and generous master. Unexpectedly, Mr. Darcy returns a day early and encounters Elizabeth and the Gardiners at Pemberley. His manners are strikingly altered; he is perfectly civil, gentle, and eager to please, especially towards Elizabeth. He invites the Gardiners and Elizabeth to dine at Pemberley and asks permission to introduce his sister, Georgiana, to Elizabeth. Elizabeth is astonished and flattered by this change, realizing his feelings for her persist despite her harsh rejection.

The next day, Darcy brings Georgiana to visit Elizabeth at the inn. Georgiana is shy and amiable, contrary to Wickham's description. Mr. Bingley also joins them, showing no particular interest in Georgiana, and his remarks hint at his continued recollection of Jane. Miss Bingley, present at Pemberley, attempts to provoke Darcy against Elizabeth by criticizing her and mentioning the militia (referencing Wickham), but Darcy defends Elizabeth and states he has considered her one of the handsomest women he knows for many months.

A letter from Jane then brings devastating news: Lydia has eloped with Mr. Wickham to Scotland, but it is now feared they did not go to Scotland and that Wickham has no intention of marrying her. Lydia has left gambling debts behind. Elizabeth is horrified and blames herself for not exposing Wickham earlier. Mr. Darcy appears and, seeing Elizabeth's distress, she confides in him. Darcy is visibly shocked and distressed by the news. He assures Elizabeth of his secrecy and offers his assistance. Elizabeth's aunt and uncle Gardiner rush to London to help Mr. Bennet, who is already there, search for Lydia.

Mr. Gardiner's subsequent letter informs the family that he has found Lydia and Wickham in London. Wickham had no intention of marrying Lydia, but Mr. Gardiner, through Darcy's intervention, has secured their marriage. Darcy, feeling responsible for not having exposed Wickham's true character earlier, secretly paid off Wickham's substantial debts (over a thousand pounds), settled an additional thousand pounds on Lydia, and bought Wickham a commission in a regiment far in the north. Mr. Gardiner, though wanting to pay, was forced to allow Darcy to do so. Mrs. Bennet is oblivious to the disgrace and overjoyed by the prospect of a married daughter, while Mr. Bennet is mortified by his own past indulgence and the family's obligation to Darcy. He forbids Lydia and Wickham from Longbourn. Jane and Elizabeth persuade their father to receive the couple before they depart for the north.

Lydia and Wickham return to Longbourn as a married couple. Lydia is as frivolous and unashamed as ever, boasting about her wedding and even casually mentioning that Mr. Darcy was present and ""might have done as well"" to give her away. This casual revelation shocks Elizabeth, who then writes to Mrs. Gardiner for the full explanation. Darcy's intervention and generosity are fully revealed, solidifying Elizabeth's gratitude and love for him. She is humbled by his goodness in overcoming his pride for her sake, despite her past behavior and her family's disgrace.

Mr. Bingley returns to Netherfield and renews his attentions to Jane. Mrs. Bennet, through her schemes, manages to leave Jane and Bingley alone, leading to Bingley's proposal. Jane joyfully accepts. Elizabeth is delighted for her sister and believes this outcome was facilitated by Darcy's earlier confession to Bingley about his mistake in judging Jane's affections.

Soon after, Lady Catherine de Bourgh unexpectedly visits Longbourn. She imperiously confronts Elizabeth, having heard a rumor that Elizabeth is to marry Mr. Darcy. Lady Catherine demands Elizabeth promise never to marry Darcy, citing his supposed engagement to her daughter and the Bennet family's inferior connections, especially Lydia's recent elopement. Elizabeth firmly refuses to make such a promise, asserting her independence and dismissing Lady Catherine's arguments. Lady Catherine leaves in a rage. This confrontation, however, unexpectedly confirms to Elizabeth that Darcy still loves her and that Lady Catherine's opposition only strengthened his resolve.

Mr. Bennet receives a letter from Mr. Collins, confirming the rumor of Elizabeth's engagement to Darcy and relaying Lady Catherine's strong disapproval. Mr. Bennet finds the idea of Elizabeth marrying Darcy (whom he still considers proud and unpleasant) amusing and absurd, but Elizabeth assures him of her love for Darcy and explains the gradual change in her feelings and Darcy's true character, including his benevolence towards Lydia. Her father, finally convinced, gives his consent, saying Darcy ""deserves you."" Mrs. Bennet is ecstatic, only concerned with Darcy's wealth and status.

Elizabeth then playfully asks Darcy how he fell in love with her, to which he replies he was ""in the middle before I knew that I _had_ begun."" He admits he was drawn to her lively mind and found her unlike the other women who sought his approval. He confesses his past pride and the pain her reproofs caused him, which ultimately led him to reflect and change. He states his ""real purpose was to see _you_,"" and his subsequent confession to Bingley about Jane's affections was his ""avowed"" purpose.

Mr. Darcy writes to Lady Catherine, and Mr. Bennet writes to Mr. Collins, both informing them of the engagement. Miss Bingley sends insincere congratulations, while Georgiana Darcy expresses sincere delight. Lady Catherine is initially ""extremely indignant"" and cuts off all communication, but Elizabeth later persuades Darcy to seek reconciliation, and Lady Catherine eventually visits them at Pemberley, her resentment giving way.

Mr. Bingley and Jane remain at Netherfield for a year, then purchase an estate closer to Pemberley. Kitty, removed from Lydia's influence, improves greatly under her elder sisters' guidance, though her father forbids her from visiting Lydia. Mary, the only remaining daughter at home, is forced to mix more in society. Wickham and Lydia continue their extravagant and unsettled life, often needing financial assistance from Elizabeth. Darcy, for Elizabeth's sake, helps Wickham in his profession. Miss Bingley drops her resentment towards Elizabeth to maintain her right to visit Pemberley. Elizabeth and Darcy, now married, live happily at Pemberley, often visited by the Gardiners, to whom they remain eternally grateful for their role in bringing them together."
Robinson Crusoe-Daniel Defoe,"Robinson Crusoe was born in York in 1632. Despite his father's earnest advice to pursue a stable ""middle state"" of life and his mother's pleas, Crusoe, at eighteen, felt an irresistible urge to go to sea. He disregarded his parents' counsel and, in September 1651, embarked on his first voyage from Hull to London with a companion. A violent storm struck, terrifying him and prompting vows of repentance, but these were soon forgotten after the storm abated and he was encouraged by his companion to drink and be merry.

Six days later, their ship was caught in a more severe storm in Yarmouth Roads, where it sprung a leak and was eventually deemed lost. Crusoe and the ten other crew members were rescued by a boat from another ship, only to watch their own vessel sink. Despite this ""visible token"" against a seafaring life, as warned by his companion's father, Crusoe, ashamed to return home, traveled to London and sought a new adventure.

He embarked on a voyage to Guinea, Africa. His first trip was successful, financially enriching him and teaching him navigation skills. However, his captain friend died, and Crusoe, against better judgment, joined a second voyage as a gentleman trader. This ship was captured by a Turkish rover from Sallee. Crusoe was enslaved by the rover captain for two years, working in his garden or on his ship.

He plotted an escape. An opportunity arose when his master sent him, along with a young Moorish boy named Xury and another Moor, to fish in the ship's long-boat. Crusoe secretly loaded the boat with provisions, tools (hatchet, saw, hammer), and firearms. Once at sea, he forcibly threw the other Moor overboard, then convinced Xury to swear loyalty to him. They sailed south along the African coast, encountering wild animals. Crusoe shot and killed a lion after it approached their boat. He and Xury skinned it.

Continuing their journey, they encountered native black people on shore, who traded food for Crusoe's offerings. Crusoe also shot a leopard that attacked them. After 11 more days, they sighted the Cape de Verde Islands. Soon after, they spotted a Portuguese ship. Crusoe signaled for help and was rescued. The generous captain took him and his salvaged goods (including the skins) on board without charge. Crusoe sold his boat to the captain and sold Xury to him for sixty pieces of eight, on the condition that Xury would be freed in ten years if he became a Christian.

Crusoe arrived in Brazil, where he received a substantial sum for his goods. He settled as a planter, buying land and slaves. After four years, his plantation was thriving, but his restless nature led him to join a secret venture with other planters to trade for slaves in Guinea. Against wise advice, he left his flourishing plantation, making a will that named the Portuguese captain his heir.

On September 1, 1659, exactly eight years after his first ill-fated voyage, Crusoe set sail for Guinea. A violent hurricane struck, driving their ship far off course towards the coast of Guiana. The ship became leaky and disabled. Another storm hit, and the ship struck a sandbank. Crusoe and ten other men tried to escape in a boat, but a massive wave capsized it, drowning everyone but Crusoe.

Crusoe was washed ashore on a desolate island, half-dead and without possessions except a knife, tobacco pipe, and a little tobacco. He slept in a tree, fearing wild beasts. The next morning, he discovered the ship had floated closer to shore during the night. Over the next two weeks, he made eleven trips to the wreck, salvaging vital supplies: food, rum, tools (including a carpenter's chest and a grindstone), firearms, ammunition, clothes, a hammock, and eventually money. On his last trip, he found about £36 in various coins, which he deemed useless but took. The ship broke up and disappeared in a storm.

Crusoe established a fortified dwelling near a rock, building a double tent and digging a cave. He stored his goods and fortified the area with stakes and cables, using a ladder for entry. A lightning storm made him realize the danger to his gunpowder, so he spent two weeks dividing and hiding it in numerous small parcels. He discovered goats on the island and learned to hunt them. He also found wild pigeons. He made a wooden shovel and hod for digging.

He began keeping a journal on September 30, 1659, marking the days on a large wooden cross. He salvaged Bibles, other books, pens, ink, and paper. He was joined by the ship's dog and two cats, which had swum ashore. He tamed a kid goat, which inspired him to start a tame herd.

He established a routine of hunting, working, and religious reflection. He learned the island's seasons and discovered that scattering some chicken feed from the ship accidentally resulted in stalks of barley and rice growing. He carefully saved this crop, learning through trial and error (losing the first crop by sowing in the dry season) how to cultivate them, eventually yielding two harvests a year. He spent much time creating basic necessities like baskets, pottery (learning to bake them hard in a fire), a wooden mortar and pestle for grinding corn, and sieves from old neckcloths. He also fashioned a primitive oven to bake bread and cakes.

Driven by a desire to escape, he attempted to refloat a large boat from his shipwreck but failed due to its weight. He then spent months felling and shaping a massive cedar tree into a canoe, only to realize he couldn't move it to the water. This experience taught him the folly of undertaking projects without considering all difficulties.

In his sixth year, he built a smaller periagua and fitted it with a mast, sail, and rudder. On a circumnavigation attempt, he was nearly swept out to sea by strong currents but managed to return to the island's northern shore. He abandoned grand escape plans by sea, contenting himself with island life. He improved his skills, even making a tobacco pipe. His tame goat herd grew to 43, providing meat, milk, butter, and cheese.

In his twenty-third year, he discovered the gruesome site of a cannibal feast on the island's southwest shore: human bones, skulls, and a fire pit. This terrified and disgusted him, causing him to redouble his fortifications and live in constant vigilance. He stopped firing his gun, fearing discovery, and moved fire-related activities to a new, concealed cave he found deep in the woods. This cave also became a secure magazine for his powder and spare arms.

Three years later, in May of his twenty-fourth year on the island, he heard gunshots at sea during a storm. He lit a signal fire and the next morning saw a shipwreck off the eastern shore. He longed for human company but was too wary of the currents to venture out immediately. Some days later, he found a drowned boy from the wreck, carrying two pieces of eight and a tobacco pipe.

Resolved to find survivors, he prepared his boat and provisions. After carefully studying the currents, he successfully sailed to the wreck. There, he found a starving dog, which he rescued. He discovered two drowned men but no other survivors. He salvaged two chests, which contained cordial waters, sweetmeats, shirts, and a significant amount of money (over 1100 pieces of eight, gold doubloons, and gold bars), along with a few pairs of shoes. He took these back to his new cave, again valuing the practical items more than the wealth.

Almost two years later, in his twenty-seventh year, while reflecting on escape, he dreamed of savages landing with a prisoner, who then escaped and ran to him for shelter. This dream prefigured a real event. One morning, Friday ran to him, terrified, reporting three canoes and 21 savages with three prisoners.

Crusoe, filled with indignation at their cannibalistic intent, resolved to attack. He and Friday armed themselves heavily. From a hidden vantage point, Crusoe observed the savages feasting. He then saw one of the prisoners was a European, bound and awaiting slaughter. Crusoe and Friday attacked, firing their guns. They killed multiple savages and wounded others. The European prisoner, a Spaniard, was untied by Crusoe and, re-armed, joined the fight. Friday, meanwhile, pursued the fleeing cannibals, killing more. In total, 17 savages were killed.

Crusoe discovered another bound prisoner in one of the canoes – Friday's own father. Friday was overcome with joy, embracing his father, providing him with food and water. The Spaniard, too weak to walk, was carried by Friday. Crusoe established a new, temporary tent outside his main fortification for the two rescued men, providing them with food and comfort. He saw his island now had three inhabitants: a Protestant (Friday), a Pagan (Friday's father), and a Papist (the Spaniard).

Friday's father told Crusoe that the remaining savages who escaped the attack were so terrified, believing their attackers were ""heavenly spirits"" who darted fire, that they would never return to the island. This proved true for the next 17 years. The Spaniard then revealed that there were sixteen more of his countrymen and Portuguese survivors living on the mainland, castaways who were suffering from lack of provisions.

Crusoe, cautious of treachery, had the Spaniard propose a plan: he and Friday's father would go to the mainland and ask the other Europeans to swear an oath of fidelity to Crusoe in exchange for rescue. The Spaniard suggested waiting until after another harvest to ensure enough provisions for all. Crusoe agreed, and they spent months cultivating more land, producing a large store of corn and raisins. They also built oak planks for a new ship.

The Spaniard and Friday's father departed in October. After eight days, Friday rushed in, reporting three canoes with men and an English ship anchored offshore. Crusoe, wary, discovered that the men landing were mutineers from the ship, who had marooned their captain and two loyal crewmen.

Crusoe, disguised as the island's ""governor"" with Friday as his ""lieutenant-general,"" rescued the captain and his two men. They devised a plan to retake the ship. They first disabled the mutineers' original boat. When a second boat of mutineers came ashore, Crusoe's party ambushed them, killing the ringleaders and capturing the rest. They then used a ruse, pretending to be a large force, to make the remaining mutineers on the ship surrender. The ship was successfully recovered.

Crusoe conversed with the captain, sharing his incredible story, and received new clothes, food, and other supplies. He then offered the incorrigible mutineers the choice to be left on the island rather than face hanging in England. They accepted. Crusoe provided them with firearms, ammunition, tools, and instructions on how to survive, and told them about the 17 Spaniards they could expect.

On December 19, 1686, after 28 years, 2 months, and 19 days, Robinson Crusoe, accompanied by Friday and taking his goat-skin cap, umbrella, and one parrot as relics, along with his salvaged money, departed the island aboard the recovered English ship.

He arrived in England in June 1687. He found his initial benefactor, the widow, in poverty, and he helped her. His parents were dead, and his family nearly extinct, but he found two sisters and two nephews, whom he also aided. He received £200 from the ship's owners as a reward.

He traveled to Lisbon to inquire about his Brazilian plantation and found his old Portuguese captain friend, now retired. He learned his plantation had thrived, making his partner rich, and that his share, presumed lost, was worth a considerable sum and had been managed by government trustees for charitable causes. He regained his estate, which yielded over £1000 a year, and found himself suddenly wealthy. He generously rewarded the old captain with an annuity.

Despite his wealth, Crusoe still had a ""wandering life"" inclination. He provided for his relatives and considered returning to Brazil, but vague religious ""scruples"" and the lack of a trustworthy person to manage his affairs kept him from settling there. He eventually resolved to return to England with his wealth.

After settling his affairs in Lisbon, he chose to travel overland through Spain and France, having a strong aversion to sea travel due to past misfortunes. He and Friday joined a company of English and Portuguese gentlemen. Their journey through the Pyrenees was fraught with heavy snow, wolves, and a bear, which Friday bravely killed. They eventually reached Dover in January, after a difficult journey.

In England, Crusoe married, had three children, but his wife died. His nephew, a ship captain, persuaded him to embark on a trading voyage to the East Indies in 1694. On this voyage, he revisited his island, found the Spaniards and former mutineers living there, and learned of their continued struggles, including battles with Caribbeans, their improvements to the island, and the capture of 11 men and 5 women prisoners, resulting in 20 children. He stayed for twenty days, providing them with supplies and workmen. He then sailed to Brazil, from where he sent more people and seven women to his island colony, along with livestock.

The text concludes by stating that further surprising incidents from his subsequent ten years of adventures would be recounted in the ""Second Part of my Story."""
Six Characters in Search of an Author-Luigi Pirandello,"The play opens on a theater stage set for a rehearsal, half dark and empty, with typical rehearsal furniture like a prompter's box and tables. The actors and actresses of a company, about nine or ten in number, enter and prepare to rehearse a Pirandello play titled ""Mixing It Up."" The Manager arrives and begins directing the setup of a ""red room"" set for the second act, specifying entrances and exits. When the Prompter reads a line about the Leading Man wearing a cook's cap and beating an egg, the Leading Man objects, finding it ridiculous. The Manager, annoyed, defends the play, explaining its symbolic nature (reason vs. instinct) but admits he doesn't fully understand it and predicts a ""glorious failure.""

At this point, six mysterious figures, referred to as the Six Characters, enter the stage, preceded by a Door-keeper. They are enveloped in a faint, dream-like light. The characters are: a Father (about 50, reddish hair, fattish, piercing blue eyes, alternately mellifluous and violent); a Mother (crushed, terrified, dressed in modest black with a thick widow's veil, wax-like face, eyes downcast); a Step-Daughter (dashing, impudent, beautiful, elegantly in mourning, contemptuous of the Boy but tender towards the Child); a Boy (14, timid, dressed in black); a Child (about four, dressed in white with a black sash); and a Son (22, tall, severe, contemptuous of the Father, indifferent to the Mother, appearing unwilling to be there).

The Father explains that they are ""characters in search of an author"" because they were conceived by an author who failed to complete their story, leaving them ""side-tracked."" They desire to ""live"" their drama on stage, proposing themselves as the Manager's new play. The Manager is initially dismissive, believing them to be mad, and the actors laugh. The Father argues that characters are more real than living people because their reality is immutable, unlike human reality which changes.

The Step-Daughter vividly interjects, performing a song and dance, and declares her eagerness to act her part. She reveals that she, the Boy, and the Child are ""bastards"" and that the Son despises them and their common Mother. The Mother becomes faint with anguish. The Father supports her, and despite her protests, lifts her veil, revealing her face. He then explains their ""drama"": the Mother had a lover (now dead for two months, hence their mourning), and the core of the story lies in the four children she had by two men.

The Mother protests, asserting the Father forced her to go away with the other man. The Step-Daughter contradicts this, claiming the Mother wants the Son to believe this to excuse her abandonment, and that the Mother lived happily with her (the Step-Daughter's) father. The Father admits he ""drove her away"" but claims it was for her good, to be free of him, and also for his own liberation. He sent their legitimate Son away to the country for a healthy upbringing.

The Son expresses disgust, calling the Father's explanations ""phrases."" The Step-Daughter then reveals a shocking detail: the Father almost paid her 100 lire in a ""pale blue envelope"" at Madame Pace's shop, which she implies is a brothel. She describes the setting of the shop in detail. The Father attempts to explain his actions, citing his ""confounded aspirations towards a certain moral sanity"" and the ""incongruity"" of his nature. He claims he watched the Mother's new family with ""pure interest,"" a claim the Step-Daughter confirms by recounting him following her home from school and giving her gifts.

The Step-Daughter then states that after her (step)father died, they faced ""absolute misery"" and the Mother, through her ""stupidity,"" went to work for Madame Pace. The Father, driven by his ""miserable flesh"" and disdain for ""debasement,"" found himself in Madame Pace's shop where he encountered the Step-Daughter. The Mother arrived ""in time"" (Father) or ""almost in time"" (Step-Daughter) to witness the scene. The Father then brought the whole family back to his house. He describes his shame and how he cannot look the Mother in the face.

The Son vehemently denies his involvement, calling himself an ""unrealized"" character and stating he has nothing to do with their ""vulgar folk"" drama. The Father argues that the Son is central due to his cruel aloofness. He outlines the eventual tragic conclusion: the death of the little girl, the Boy's tragedy, and the Step-Daughter's flight, leaving only the estranged Father, Mother, and Son.

The Manager, intrigued, decides to attempt to stage their drama. He takes the Six Characters to his office to arrange the scenario, while the actors express skepticism and ridicule.

The second act begins with the Step-Daughter, Child, and Boy emerging from the Manager's office. The Step-Daughter expresses frustration and speaks to the Child about the ""horrid comedy"" they must play. She discovers a revolver in the Boy's pocket and suggests he should have shot the Father and Son rather than killing himself. The Father and Manager return, excited about having ""arranged everything.""

The Son, meanwhile, expresses his profound shame and resentment at their private lives being exposed on stage. The stage is then reset to portray Madame Pace's shop, with the Characters giving specific demands for props like a yellow sofa and a little mahogany table for the pale blue envelope. The Manager instructs his Prompter to record the scenes in shorthand as the Characters ""act now"" for the benefit of the company actors, who are to merely observe.

A conflict arises when the Father and Step-Daughter express their difficulty with the actors portraying them, arguing that actors cannot truly embody their unique ""temperaments"" and ""souls."" The Manager dismisses this, asserting his actors provide the necessary ""body and form.""

To stage the scene in Madame Pace's shop, the Father has the actresses hang their hats and a mantle on pegs. This act miraculously causes Madame Pace herself to appear, a comically elegant, rouged woman who speaks in a mix of Italian and Spanish jargon. The Step-Daughter immediately recognizes her. The Father declares this a demonstration of the stage's magic to draw forth reality.

The Step-Daughter and Madame Pace begin to perform their scene, but their quiet, natural dialogue is inaudible to the actors. The Manager insists they speak louder for the audience. The Step-Daughter explains that certain things cannot be shouted and that the Father must be waiting behind a door, just as it truly happened. Madame Pace refuses to act with the Mother present.

The Step-Daughter then directs the Father to make his entry. They perform the scene of their encounter: the Father greets the Step-Daughter, realizing her youth, and, despite her mourning dress, attempts to take off her hat and offer her a new one. The Mother watches with intense anguish, sobbing. The Manager intervenes to direct the Prompter on what to cut or include for stage effect.

The Leading Man and Leading Lady attempt to recreate the scene. The Step-Daughter and Father both burst out laughing and object to the actors' portrayal, finding it inauthentic to their lived experience. The Manager becomes furious, trying to assert his authority. The Step-Daughter reveals that in the real scene, the Father suggested she take off her dress, not just discussed her mourning. The Manager recoils, stating such a thing is impossible for the stage. The Step-Daughter threatens to leave, accusing the Manager of wanting a ""romantic sentimental scene"" instead of her ""truth."" The Mother, overcome, breaks down in tears. The Step-Daughter then challenges the Manager to let her act the scene ""as it really did,"" by asking the Mother to leave. The Mother vehemently refuses, stating her torment is real and continuous. The Father adds that the Step-Daughter wants to fix him ""eternally in the stocks"" for that shameful moment. The Step-Daughter vividly describes her physical sensations during the encounter and implores her Mother to ""Cry out as you did then!"" The Mother, crying out, runs to separate them, calling the Father a ""brute."" The Manager, pleased with the dramatic climax, shouts ""Curtain!"", but the Machinist mistakenly lowers the curtain prematurely, leaving the Manager and Father in front of it.

In the third act, the stage is re-set for a garden scene, with trees and a fountain basin. The Mother sits with the two younger children, while the Son remains apart, bored and angry. The Father and Step-Daughter are also seated. The Manager expresses confidence in the new act. The Step-Daughter reiterates that their entry into the Father's house was against the Son's wishes. The Mother pleads for it to be clear she tried to pacify the Step-Daughter. The Step-Daughter also notes the Son's aloofness to the Mother's pleas.

A dispute arises over setting. The Step-Daughter argues the entire act cannot be in the garden, as the Son is usually in his room and the Boy's actions are indoors. The Manager insists on grouping the action for theatrical practicality. The Father strongly objects to the word ""illusion,"" explaining that what is a ""game of art"" for the actors is the Characters' ""sole reality,"" which is fixed and immutable, unlike the transient reality of living people. The Manager dismisses this as excessive philosophizing.

The Step-Daughter recalls attempting to tempt their author to complete their story, suggesting he abandoned them out of disgust for ordinary theatre, which the Son agrees with. The Father denies this, attributing it to the Step-Daughter's insistence. The Father insists on portraying the full ""torment of my spirit,"" arguing that to reduce his story to mere facts would destroy his ""raison d'être.""

The Manager insists on grouping all action in the garden. He tries to direct the Boy to hide behind trees. The Step-Daughter states the Boy will not speak while the Son is present, suggesting he be sent away. The Son expresses delight at the prospect of leaving, but the Step-Daughter ironically states he ""can't go away,"" being ""indissolubly bound to the chain."" She convinces the Mother to approach the Son, who still vehemently refuses to act. The Father tries to force him, but the Son resists, claiming to embody the author's original wish to not put them on stage.

The Manager asks the Son what truly happened in the garden. The Son hesitates, then reveals the baby is ""There in the fountain...."" The Father adds that the Mother was following the Son at that moment. The Son describes running to pull the baby out, but seeing the Boy ""standing stock still, with eyes like a madman's, watching his little drowned sister, in the fountain!"" The Step-Daughter bends over the fountain, sobbing, to hide the Child. Suddenly, a revolver shot rings out from behind the trees where the Boy is hidden.

Chaos erupts. The Mother screams and runs towards the sound, followed by actors. Some actors exclaim ""He's dead! dead!"" while others cry, ""No, no, it's only make believe, it's only pretence!"" The Father, with a terrible cry, asserts, ""Pretence? Reality, sir, reality!"" The Manager, utterly frustrated, exclaims, ""Pretence? Reality? To hell with it all! Never in my life has such a thing happened to me. I've lost a whole day over these people, a whole day!"" The curtain falls, concluding the play."
The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn-Mark Twain,"Huckleberry Finn (Huck), a young boy, recounts his story, beginning by mentioning his previous adventures with Tom Sawyer where they found a fortune of $6,000 each, hidden by robbers. Judge Thatcher invested Huck's money, providing him a dollar a day. The Widow Douglas adopted Huck to ""sivilize"" him, which Huck found stifling. He briefly ran away but was convinced by Tom Sawyer to return and become ""respectable"" in exchange for joining Tom's band of robbers.

Living with the Widow and her sister, Miss Watson, Huck found their strict rules and religious teachings (like Moses and the Bulrushers) tiresome. Miss Watson constantly nagged him about his behavior and described heaven as a place of endless singing, which Huck disliked, especially when he learned Tom Sawyer wouldn't be there. One night, after a spider incident that Huck took as a bad omen, he met Tom Sawyer, who signaled him with a ""me-yow!""

Huck and Tom tiptoed past Miss Watson's ""nigger,"" Jim, who was sleeping. Tom played a prank by hanging Jim's hat on a tree limb. Jim later fabricated an elaborate story about witches riding him all over the state, making him a revered figure among other ""niggers."" The boys then met up with other local lads—Joe Harper, Ben Rogers, and more—and formed ""Tom Sawyer's Gang"" in a hidden cave. They swore a blood oath to keep secrets, commit robbery and murder, and ransom captives. Huck, having no family to offer for the oath's revenge clause, offered Miss Watson. Tom's interpretation of ""ransom"" was confused, suggesting keeping captives until they died. The gang's first ""raid"" was on a Sunday-school picnic, which Tom insisted was actually a caravan of ""Spanish merchants and A-rabs"" turned into children by magicians. Huck grew disillusioned with Tom's fantastical stories and resigned from the gang.

Months later, in winter, Huck was attending school and adapting to ""sivilized"" life, though he still preferred his old ways. After accidentally spilling salt (a bad omen), he discovered his abusive, drunken father, Pap, had returned. Pap's distinctive boot-tracks with a cross for warding off the devil confirmed his presence. Fearing Pap would seize his money, Huck immediately went to Judge Thatcher and convinced him to ""buy"" all of his $6,000 for a dollar. That night, Huck consulted Jim, who used a ""hair-ball"" for magic. The hair-ball predicted Pap was undecided on his next move and warned Huck of future troubles but assured him he'd recover and marry twice, but to stay away from water to avoid being ""hung.""

Pap then appeared in Huck's room, looking ragged and sick. He berated Huck for his education and fine clothes, demanding his money. Pap took Huck's dollar for whiskey. Pap, enraged by Huck's attempts to be respectable, became violent, threatening to ""cowhide"" him. The Judge and Widow attempted to gain custody of Huck, but a new judge refused to separate family. Pap, after being jailed for drunkenness, was briefly ""reformed"" by the judge but quickly relapsed, trading new clothes for whiskey, breaking his arm, and freezing.

Pap then forcibly took Huck to a remote log hut on the Illinois shore, keeping him captive. He locked Huck in the cabin, frequently leaving to trade fish and game for whiskey, returning to get drunk and beat Huck. Huck initially enjoyed the freedom from ""sivilization"" but soon tired of Pap's abuse and long absences. He found an old saw and began cutting his way out of the cabin. Pap returned, complaining about his lawsuit for Huck's money and a potential second trial to make the Widow Huck's guardian. Pap launched into a drunken rant against the government for denying him his ""rights"" and allowing ""free niggers"" to vote. During his delirium tremens, Pap chased Huck with a knife, threatening to kill him. Huck escaped Pap's grasp, armed himself with a gun, and waited.

The next morning, Huck, pretending ignorance, sent Pap to check fishing lines. He then found a drifting canoe, hid it, and began putting his escape plan into motion. While Pap was in town selling salvaged logs, Huck finished sawing through the cabin log. He gathered supplies, killed a wild pig, smashed the cabin door, bled the pig on the floor, and dragged a sack of rocks to the river to create a trail, making it appear he had been murdered and his body thrown in. He then ""blooded"" an axe and discarded the pig in the river. He ripped a hole in a meal sack and dragged it to a nearby lake, leaving a trail of meal to suggest robbers had taken his belongings. He then hid the canoe and waited. That night, he saw Pap in a skiff. Huck quickly paddled downstream, past the ferry landing, and landed on Jackson's Island, hiding his canoe.

On Jackson's Island, Huck woke to the sound of a cannon, realizing the town was searching for his ""body."" He salvaged a loaf of ""baker's bread"" (used to find drowned bodies with quicksilver). He watched the ferryboat, carrying Pap, Judge Thatcher, Tom Sawyer, and others, searching for him. The cannon blasts and smoke were intense. After the search ended, Huck made camp. While exploring, he discovered a still-smoking campfire and, after much fear, found Miss Watson's Jim. Jim, thinking Huck was a ghost, was terrified until Huck reassured him. Jim then revealed he had run away after overhearing Miss Watson planning to sell him downriver for $800. He described his escape on a raft and his narrow miss from the men searching for Huck. He then proudly declared he was ""rich now"" because he ""owns mysef, en I’s wuth eight hund’d dollars.""

Huck and Jim moved their camp to a hidden cavern on the island. A big storm and rising river followed, confirming Jim's weather predictions. They salvaged a lumber raft and, later, a two-story frame-house that floated downriver. Inside the house, they found a dead man shot in the back. Jim covered his face, not wanting Huck to see. They scavenged various items, including money ($8), clothes, tools, and a wooden leg. Jim warned Huck against touching a snake-skin, citing bad luck. Huck, however, placed a dead rattlesnake on Jim's blanket as a prank. The snake's mate then bit Jim, causing his foot and leg to swell badly. Jim drank Pap's whiskey to cope. Huck, feeling guilty, resolved never to touch a snake-skin again.

After Jim recovered, Huck decided to explore a town across the river. To avoid being recognized, he disguised himself as a girl, ""Sarah Williams."" At a shanty, he met Mrs. Judith Loftus, who informed him that Pap was suspected of his murder, but later suspicion shifted to Jim, a runaway slave with a $300 reward. Mrs. Loftus revealed her husband and another man planned to search Jackson's Island for Jim that night, having seen smoke there. Huck, alarmed, tried to hide his unease. Mrs. Loftus, suspicious of his mannerisms (threading a needle, throwing a lead knot), quickly exposed him as a boy. She gave him advice on proper girl behavior and told him to remember his real name and seek her help if needed. Huck immediately raced back to the island, warning Jim of the imminent danger. They loaded their raft and slipped silently downriver.

As they drifted, Huck's conscience bothered him about helping Jim escape, considering it ""stealing"" Miss Watson's property. Jim, meanwhile, shared his dreams of earning money to buy his family's freedom. Huck decided to turn Jim in at Cairo, where the Ohio River met the Mississippi, to ease his conscience. However, when Jim expressed heartfelt gratitude, calling Huck his ""only fren',"" Huck couldn't bring himself to betray him. Just then, two armed men in a skiff approached, looking for runaway ""niggers"" with smallpox. Huck, quick-witted, lied that his sick family on the raft had smallpox, scaring the men away. They left him $40 in gold, telling him to float twenty miles downstream to a town where he could get help. Huck, reflecting on his actions, concluded that doing ""right"" (turning Jim in) felt wrong, and doing ""wrong"" (helping Jim) felt right, so he would follow whatever ""come handiest.""

They discovered they had passed Cairo in a fog. Their canoe was stolen, leaving them stranded on the raft, heading further south into slave territory. Later, a steamboat smashed through their raft, separating them. Huck surfaced, calling for Jim, then grabbed a plank and swam ashore. He found himself at a large log house, where dogs cornered him.

A family, the Grangerfords, took him in, believing him to be ""George Jackson,"" a boy who fell off a steamboat. Huck invented a story about his family dying on a small farm in Arkansaw. He learned the Grangerfords were in a long-standing, violent feud with another family, the Shepherdsons, which had resulted in many deaths. He observed the family's elegant home, Emmeline Grangerford's mournful poetry, and the general atmosphere of polite, well-dressed people who carried guns to church. Miss Sophia Grangerford secretly asked Huck to retrieve her Testament from church, where he found a note saying ""Half past two.""

Huck then discovered his ""nigger"" (Jim) was hiding nearby in the swamp, having been led there by the Grangerford slaves after the raft was damaged in the steamboat collision and caught on a snag. Jim had pieced the raft back together. Huck learned Miss Sophia had run off to marry young Harney Shepherdson. This ignited a bloody gunfight between the Grangerfords and Shepherdsons. Huck witnessed the brutal killing of Buck and his cousin Joe in the river, feeling sickened. He then fled back to Jim, who had already retrieved the repaired raft. They pushed off, relieved to be free of the feud.

They continued downriver, living an easy, naked life on the raft, enjoying the quiet. They debated philosophical questions like the origin of stars and the wisdom of King Solomon (Jim found Solomon foolish for wanting to cut a child in half). They also encountered two frauds: a seventy-year-old bald man claiming to be the Duke of Bridgewater and a thirty-year-old claiming to be the King of France (Louis XVII, the Dauphin). Both were con artists, escaping from angry mobs. Huck recognized them as fakes but played along for peace.

The king and duke, after hearing Huck's invented story of his past, devised a new scam. They learned about Peter Wilks, a recently deceased wealthy man, from a young man on a steamboat. Peter had left an inheritance for his two brothers, Harvey and William (one deaf and dumb), who were expected from England, and for his three nieces. The king and duke impersonated the brothers, with the king posing as Harvey (an English preacher) and the duke as the deaf and dumb William. They put on an elaborate performance of grief, convincing the Wilks nieces and most of the town.

They found $6,000 cash Peter had hidden in the cellar but discovered it was $415 short. To maintain their credibility, they made up the difference from their own money. The duke then suggested they give the entire $6,000 to the nieces, a move that would silence any suspicions. They publicly presented the money, overwhelming the nieces with gratitude. Dr. Robinson, a local, immediately recognized them as frauds due to their terrible English accents and lack of genuine sorrow, warning the nieces. However, Mary Jane Wilks, deeply moved, defiantly gave the money back to the king, trusting him implicitly.

Huck, disgusted by the frauds, resolved to steal the money back for the girls. He found where the king and duke hid the money (in a straw tick under a feather-bed) and took it. Hearing Mary Jane crying over the separation of the slave family, Huck, on impulse, blurted out that the slaves would be reunited in two weeks. He then confided in Mary Jane, revealing the truth about the king and duke being frauds. He instructed her to leave town for a few days to avoid betraying her knowledge, and to leave a candle in her window by 11 PM if he was safe. He also wrote a note revealing the money was hidden in Peter Wilks's coffin, which he gave to Mary Jane. Mary Jane left, promising to pray for him. Huck then lied to Mary Jane's sisters about her whereabouts, saying she was visiting friends who were sick with a ""new kind"" of mumps.

The town held the auction for Peter Wilks's property. Just as the last item was sold, the real Harvey and William Wilks arrived. The town was thrown into confusion, with Dr. Robinson and Lawyer Levi Bell immediately identifying the king and duke as frauds. The real Harvey Wilks, who was an actual preacher, could not write with his broken arm. The king and duke, using their acting skills, tried to deny the accusations. The real Harvey, remembering a tattoo on his brother Peter's chest, challenged the king to describe it. The king guessed ""a small, thin, blue arrow."" Ab Turner, who had helped lay out the body, contradicted him, saying there was no such mark. Harvey then stated the mark was ""P—B—W,"" but again, Ab Turner denied seeing any marks at all.

The crowd, furious, decided to dig up Peter Wilks's coffin to verify the tattoo. As they dug in the pouring rain during a thunderstorm, a lightning flash revealed the bag of gold resting on Peter Wilks's breast. In the ensuing chaos, Huck escaped. He fled back to the raft, telling Jim they were free. However, in another lightning flash, they saw the king and duke pursuing them in a skiff.

Aboard the raft, the king accused Huck of trying to escape. Huck fabricated a story about his escape from the grave. The king and duke then argued over who hid the money in the coffin, each accusing the other of planning to double-cross them. The king eventually confessed. They later reconciled over whiskey.

The frauds continued their cons, but with little success. Jim complained about being tied up daily. The duke dressed Jim as a ""Sick Arab"" with blue paint, allowing him to be untied and scare people off. The king decided to advertise Jim as a runaway slave. Huck, upon hearing this, was deeply troubled. He wrote a letter to Miss Watson, intending to turn Jim in, but as he reflected on their journey and Jim's unwavering kindness, he tore up the letter, resolving to ""go to hell"" rather than betray Jim. He then planned to steal Jim back.

Huck returned to the Phelps's plantation, where he was mistaken for Tom Sawyer by Aunt Sally. He continued the charade, inventing stories about his journey and family. He was surprised when the real Tom Sawyer arrived, also mistaken for Tom's brother, Sid. Tom, instead of revealing Huck, embraced the adventure and agreed to help Huck ""steal"" Jim, much to Huck's astonishment. Tom then devised an elaborate, romanticized escape plan for Jim, insisting on unnecessary complications like digging Jim out with case-knives, having a ""coat of arms,"" and a mournful inscription.

Tom and Huck began their elaborate plan. They filed pens out of pewter spoons and brass candlesticks, stole a sheet for a rope ladder (to be baked in a pie), and tin plates for Jim's journal. They captured rats and snakes for Jim's ""dumb pets."" Aunt Sally grew increasingly confused by disappearing household items and the strange occurrences, blaming rats, a calf, and her own miscounting. They left anonymous warning letters for the Phelpses, culminating in a letter warning of a ""desprate gang of cutthroats"" planning to steal Jim.

The Phelps family, along with fifteen armed farmers, waited for the supposed robbers. Huck, trying to retrieve butter from the cellar, was caught by Aunt Sally, who thought he had ""brain-fever"" when she saw melting butter running down his face. She sent him to bed. Huck warned Tom about the armed men. Tom, Jim, and Huck narrowly escaped the cabin as the men stormed in. During the chase, Tom was shot in the leg.

Jim refused to proceed without a doctor for Tom. Huck went to fetch a doctor, fabricating a story about Tom accidentally shooting himself during a hunting trip. The doctor, impressed by Jim's nursing of Tom, vouched for Jim's character to the Phelpses, who had recaptured and re-chained Jim.

Tom, recovering, proudly explained their elaborate escape plan to Aunt Sally, detailing all the stolen items and ""adventures."" Aunt Sally was furious but then Tom revealed that Miss Watson had died two months ago and freed Jim in her will. Just then, Tom's Aunt Polly arrived, confirming Jim's freedom and exposing Huck and Tom's true identities to the Phelpses. Aunt Polly revealed she had received letters from Aunt Sally, but Tom had hidden them.

In the end, Huck learned that his money was safe with Judge Thatcher and that Pap was the dead man they found in the floating house on the island, as Jim eventually revealed. With Jim now truly free, Tom suggested new ""howling adventures amongst the Injuns"" in the territory. However, Huck, tired of being ""sivilized"" by Aunt Sally, declared he would ""light out for the territory ahead of the rest."" He also expressed his relief that the ""trouble"" of writing the book was over."
The Count of Monte Cristo-Alexandre Dumas,"The provided text, ""The Count of Monte Cristo,"" details the intricate plot of Edmond Dantès' transformation from an innocent sailor to a powerful avenger, and the intricate ways he orchestrates the downfall of his enemies and rewards his benefactors.

**Part 1: Edmond Dantès' Arrest and Imprisonment**

The story begins on February 24, 1815, with the arrival of the three-master *Pharaon* in Marseilles. Edmond Dantès, the young and skilled first mate, is praised by the shipowner, M. Morrel, who plans to make him captain. Dantès reveals that the previous captain, Leclere, died at sea and that he, Dantès, had to stop at the Island of Elba to deliver a packet and spoke with Napoleon himself. This revelation makes M. Morrel uneasy, as such a connection could be dangerous. Dantès is eager to marry his beloved fiancée, Mercédès, and dreams of a happy future with her and his father.

However, the ship's supercargo, Danglars, is intensely jealous of Dantès' promotion. He subtly poisons M. Morrel's mind with insinuations about Dantès' stop at Elba and a supposed secret letter. Dantès then goes ashore to see his father and Mercédès. He finds his elderly father in dire poverty, having used his savings to repay a debt to their neighbor, Caderousse, a tailor. Dantès gives his father some gold and promises him a better life.

Caderousse, a greedy and envious man, arrives to ""congratulate"" Dantès. He then joins Danglars at an inn, and together they discuss Dantès' impending marriage to Mercédès. Fernand Mondego, Mercédès' cousin, is also present and deeply in love with Mercédès. He is enraged to hear of Dantès' happiness, as Mercédès has repeatedly rejected his advances, affirming her unwavering love for Edmond. Danglars, seeing Fernand's despair and knowing of Fernand's past jealousy, manipulates him. He suggests a way to prevent the marriage without killing Dantès: by having him imprisoned. Danglars writes an anonymous letter, with his left hand to disguise his writing, denouncing Edmond Dantès as a Bonapartist agent carrying a letter from Napoleon to a committee in Paris. He pretends to throw it away, but Fernand secretly retrieves it, determined to use it.

The next day, at Dantès' wedding feast, a magistrate and soldiers arrive and arrest Edmond, accused of being a Bonapartist agent. Dantès reassures his distraught father and Mercédès that it is a mistake. M. Morrel rushes to investigate. Caderousse, realizing Danglars' treachery, is briefly tempted to speak, but Danglars silences him, warning that defending Dantès would make him an accomplice. Fernand has disappeared. M. Morrel returns with the devastating news: Dantès is formally accused as a Bonapartist agent. Overwhelmed, Mercédès and old Dantès embrace in shared grief. M. Morrel, trusting Danglars, then offers him the position of interim captain of the *Pharaon*. Danglars accepts, his plan succeeding.

Meanwhile, at the marriage feast of M. de Villefort, the deputy procureur du roi, to Renée de Saint-Méran, Villefort learns of Napoleon's escape from Elba. He is ambitious and eager to prove his loyalty to the royalist government. A servant informs him of Dantès' arrest. When Villefort interrogates Dantès, he is initially impressed by the young man's innocence. However, when Dantès reveals the letter he was carrying was addressed to ""M. Noirtier"" in Paris, Villefort turns pale. Noirtier is his own father, a known Jacobin and Bonapartist. To protect his career, Villefort destroys the letter and makes Dantès swear to never mention Noirtier's name. He promises Dantès immediate freedom. But instead, Dantès is led away to the dreaded Château d'If, an island prison for political prisoners. He is thrown into a dungeon, where he contemplates suicide. He realizes Villefort betrayed him.

**Part 2: The Château d'If and the Abbé Faria**

Dantès attempts to bribe a jailer to contact Mercédès, but the jailer refuses, saying he would lose his job for 300 francs. Dantès threatens him with a stool, and the jailer reports Dantès' ""madness"" to the governor. Dantès is then moved to a deeper dungeon. He falls into despair, but one day hears a scratching sound in the wall. He communicates with another prisoner, who turns out to be the Abbé Faria, an old and learned Italian priest.

Faria reveals he has been imprisoned since 1811 for his political ideas about unifying Italy. He has made his own tools and spent years digging an escape tunnel, but made a calculation error and ended up in Dantès' cell. Faria, now partially paralyzed by a stroke, can no longer attempt escape himself. He offers to educate Dantès in exchange for his companionship. Dantès dedicates himself to learning, mastering languages, history, philosophy, and science under Faria's tutelage for over a year. He gains immense knowledge and a refined bearing.

Faria then reveals his ""treasure"": a half-burnt piece of paper detailing the location of an immense fortune (nearly 13 million francs) hidden by the wealthy Cardinal Spada on the Island of Monte Cristo. Faria explains how he discovered the will and its secret code. He makes Dantès memorize the will. Faria suffers a third, fatal stroke. Before dying, he instructs Dantès on how to use a potent elixir to prolong life, but ultimately succumbs. Dantès, in a desperate act, switches places with Faria's corpse in its winding sheet, hoping to escape. He is thrown into the sea, with a cannonball tied to his feet. He cuts himself free with a knife he kept hidden and swims to a nearby island.

**Part 3: Rebirth and Vengeance**

After fourteen years in prison, Edmond Dantès is free. He is rescued by a band of smugglers. He introduces himself as a Maltese sailor and demonstrates exceptional seafaring skills. He learns the current date is February 28, 1829. He is 33 years old. He vows implacable vengeance on Danglars, Fernand, and Villefort.

At Leghorn, he shaves and cuts his hair, marveling at his transformed appearance. He buys a yacht in Genoa and outfits it with secret compartments. He then sends Jacopo (a loyal smuggler) to Marseilles to inquire about his father and Mercédès. Jacopo returns with the tragic news: old Dantès died of hunger and Mercédès has disappeared. Dantès conceals his grief, but his resolve for vengeance hardens.

He returns to Marseilles in disguise (as ""Lord Wilmore"") and confirms his father's death and Mercédès' marriage to Fernand. He retrieves a small treasure (3,000 francs) he had buried long ago in his father's garden. He uses his vast wealth to begin his intricate plans of revenge.

He visits Caderousse, disguised as the Abbé Busoni, a Sicilian priest. He reveals Dantès' death in prison and offers Caderousse a diamond (supposedly from an English fellow-prisoner) as a legacy, to be shared with Dantès' father, Mercédès, Fernand, and Danglars. Caderousse, consumed by greed, describes how Fernand and Danglars betrayed Dantès. He also reveals that M. Morrel, Dantès' former patron, is now ruined. Caderousse then murders a jeweler, Joannes, to keep the entire diamond.

Dantès (as the ""Englishman"" Lord Wilmore) then prevents M. Morrel's bankruptcy by buying his debts and giving him an extension. He orchestrates a miraculous recovery for Morrel, sending a duplicate *Pharaon* with a new cargo and the exact amount of money needed to save his honor. He then tells Julie Morrel to expect a letter from ""Sinbad the Sailor"" with instructions, and she finds the diamond and receipt, saving her father. The Morrel family is saved, and M. Morrel is grateful to his unknown benefactor.

**Part 4: The Game of Destiny**

Monte Cristo (now his main identity), having fulfilled his benevolent promises, begins his vengeance. He manipulates Danglars (now a baron and a wealthy banker) and Villefort (now a king's attorney in Paris).

He meets Albert de Morcerf (son of Fernand and Mercédès) in Rome during Carnival. He saves Albert from a bandit kidnapping by Luigi Vampa (a notorious bandit whom Monte Cristo had previously befriended). Monte Cristo reveals his power to orchestrate events, even influencing the execution of Peppino. He offers to introduce Albert to Parisian society. Albert, impressed, accepts and invites Monte Cristo to Paris.

Monte Cristo arrives in Paris, establishing a magnificent residence in the Champs-Élysées. He buys Danglars' dappled gray horses, which causes a stir. He hosts a dinner at his Auteuil country house, inviting the Danglars and Villeforts, but notably excluding the Morcerfs.

At this dinner, Monte Cristo (now as himself) stages a chilling scene in a ""dramatic"" red damask room. He implies a crime was committed there and reveals a child's skeleton was unearthed in the garden. This deeply disturbs Madame Danglars and Villefort, as it references their shared dark secret. Bertuccio, Monte Cristo's Corsican steward (and the one who stabbed Villefort and buried the infant in the Auteuil garden years ago), is terrified, recognizing the scene of his vengeance.

Monte Cristo (disguised as the Abbé Busoni) also orchestrates the exposure of Caderousse. He forces Caderousse to write a confession implicating Andrea Cavalcanti (Benedetto) as a galley-slave and his son. Andrea is arrested.

Monte Cristo (as Lord Wilmore, an English eccentric) further manipulates Villefort's investigation into Monte Cristo's identity, providing contradictory and misleading information that makes Villefort doubt any real threat.

Villefort, meanwhile, is plagued by a series of poisonings in his house: his in-laws, the Marquis and Madame de Saint-Méran, and his old servant Barrois, all die. Doctor d'Avrigny suspects poisoning and eventually accuses Madame de Villefort, revealing her motive (Valentine's inheritance for Edward). Noirtier (Villefort's paralyzed father) uses his eye movements to communicate, confirming the poisonings and indicating Madame de Villefort as the culprit. He also reveals he has been gradually immunizing Valentine with small doses of brucine.

Danglars, due to a false telegraph message orchestrated by Monte Cristo, loses a million francs in stock speculation. He later finds himself a victim of Luigi Vampa's brigands in Rome, who slowly extort his entire remaining fortune, leaving him with only 50,000 francs.

**Part 5: Resolution**

Albert, learning of his father Fernand's betrayal of Ali Pasha (revealed by Beauchamp's newspaper article, orchestrated by Monte Cristo and Haydée), confronts Monte Cristo at the Opera. Albert, in a fit of rage, challenges Monte Cristo to a duel. Monte Cristo accepts the challenge, seemingly willing to die.

Mercédès, having recognized Edmond as Monte Cristo, visits him privately. She begs him to spare her son, Albert. Monte Cristo, softened by her plea and revealing the truth of Fernand's betrayal and his own suffering, promises Albert will live. He declares he will sacrifice his own life instead. Mercédès, deeply moved, thanks him.

Monte Cristo prepares for the duel, but Albert, after speaking with his mother, publicly apologizes to Monte Cristo at the dueling ground, declaring Monte Cristo was justified in his revenge on Fernand. Monte Cristo is profoundly moved, recognizing Mercédès' noble sacrifice.

Albert, having renounced his father's name and fortune, decides to make a new life. Monte Cristo sends Mercédès the 3,000 francs he had buried, telling her it was his father's legacy, to live modestly. Mercédès accepts, resolving to live in a convent. Albert enlists in the Spahis in Africa to earn an honorable name.

At Benedetto's trial, Benedetto publicly denounces Villefort as his father, revealing his birth in Auteuil and how Villefort buried him alive. Villefort, overwhelmed by this revelation and the previous deaths in his family (and his wife's self-poisoning), goes completely mad, digging furiously in his garden for the buried child.

Madame de Villefort, confronted by her husband, poisons herself and Edward, leaving a note stating a ""good mother cannot depart without her son."" Villefort finds them dead and descends into madness.

Monte Cristo takes Maximilian Morrel, who is despairing over Valentine's death, to Monte Cristo Island. He reveals Valentine is alive, having survived the poisoning due to Noirtier's gradual immunization and Monte Cristo's intervention, allowing her to feign death. He reunites Maximilian and Valentine.

Monte Cristo then reveals his true identity as Edmond Dantès to Maximilian and Valentine in a letter. He bequeaths his immense fortune (including the Spada treasure and his properties) to Maximilian, asking him to marry Haydée (Ali Pasha's daughter), whom he loves as a daughter. He asks Valentine to give her inheritance (from her now mad father and deceased step-mother and brother) to the poor.

Monte Cristo reflects on his vengeance, finding it hollow despite its accomplishment. He has brought ruin and death, but no true happiness. He leaves with Haydée on his yacht, seeking peace and new life. He writes to Maximilian and Valentine: ""There is neither happiness nor misery in the world; there is only the comparison of one state with another, nothing more. He who has felt the deepest grief is best able to experience supreme happiness. We must have felt what it is to die, Morrel, that we may appreciate the enjoyments of living. Live, then, and be happy... and never forget that until the day when God shall deign to reveal the future to man, all human wisdom is summed up in these two words,—‘_Wait and hope_.’""

Maximilian and Valentine are reunited and begin a new life together, filled with gratitude and love, while Monte Cristo and Haydée sail away, their ultimate destination unknown."
The Decameron-Giovanni Boccaccio,"The Decameron begins with a Proem where the author, having suffered greatly from a ""very high and noble passion"" in his youth, wishes to provide comfort to afflicted ladies, particularly those suffering from love, as men have more distractions from melancholic thoughts. He purposes to recount one hundred stories over ten days, told by an ""honourable company of seven ladies and three young men"" formed during the recent deadly pestilence, interspersed with songs.

**Day the First**
The author describes the devastating Black Death that struck Florence in 1348, causing widespread death, moral decay, and the breakdown of laws and social norms. People adopted various strategies: some lived in isolated moderation, others indulged in wild revelry, some used aromatics to ward off contagion, and many fled the city. The dead were buried without traditional rites, often in mass graves. The plague also ravaged the countryside, leading to widespread abandonment of farms and livestock.
In this dire situation, seven young, noble, discreet, and beautiful ladies (Pampinea, Fiammetta, Filomena, Emilia, Lauretta, Neifile, and Elisa), aged between eighteen and twenty-eight, meet in the deserted church of Santa Maria Novella. Pampinea suggests they leave the afflicted city for the countryside to preserve their lives and spirits. Filomena wisely insists on male guidance for their company. Conveniently, three young, agreeable, and well-bred men (Pamfilo, Filostrato, and Dioneo), who are secretly enamored of some of the ladies, enter the church. Pampinea invites them to join, and after some initial hesitation from Neifile about potential scandal, they agree to form a company.
The next morning, they depart Florence for a beautiful palace on a hill two miles away. Pampinea is elected queen for the first day and establishes a strict, joyful order: assigning servants duties and prohibiting talk of the plague or outside sorrows. After dining, dancing, and resting, they gather, and Pampinea proposes storytelling as their main diversion. The theme for the first day is ""that which is most agreeable unto each.""

**The First Story (Pamfilo): Master Ciappelletto**
Ciappelletto, a notoriously wicked notary, is hired by the merchant Musciatto Franzesi for a debt collection in Burgundy. Ciappelletto falls ill and is lodged by two Florentine brothers. Fearing that his unconfessed sins will lead to his body being cast out (bringing shame and danger to them), Ciappelletto volunteers to make a ""good"" confession. He fabricates a detailed, utterly false confession of extreme piety and minor, righteous ""sins"" to a holy friar. The friar, completely deceived, believes him a saint. Ciappelletto dies, and the friar, recounting his ""holy"" confession, convinces the townsfolk he is a saint. He is buried with honors, becomes ""Saint Ciappelletto,"" and is believed to perform miracles, illustrating God's mercy to pure-hearted supplicants despite the intercessor's true nature.

**The Second Story (Neifile): Abraham the Jew**
Jehannot de Chevigné, a Christian merchant in Paris, tries to convert his Jewish friend, Abraham. Abraham agrees to consider conversion but insists on first visiting Rome to observe the Pope and his clergy. Jehannot is distraught, fearing Abraham will be repulsed by the corruption he finds. Abraham travels to Rome, observes the widespread lust, gluttony, avarice, and simony among the clergy, from highest to lowest. He returns to Paris and tells Jehannot that, despite the clergy's depravity, Christianity must be truly divine to thrive amidst such corruption. He converts, is baptized Giovanni, and becomes a devout Christian.

**The Third Story (Filomena): Melchizedek the Jew**
Saladin, needing money, attempts to trick a wealthy Jew, Melchizedek, by asking which of the three religions (Jewish, Saracen, Christian) is the true one, hoping to seize his wealth for a perceived insult. Melchizedek, recognizing the trap, tells the parable of the three rings: a rich man with three equally beloved sons makes two identical copies of a precious ring (his legacy), giving one to each son. Thus, the true heir cannot be determined, and the question of which ring is the true one remains pending. Melchizedek applies this to the three religions. Saladin, impressed by his wisdom, reveals his true need. Melchizedek lends him the money, and they become friends.

**The Fourth Story (Dioneo): A Monk's Reproach**
A young, lusty monk in a solitary monastery seduces a country lass and brings her to his cell. The abbot, arising from sleep, overhears them and secretly observes the monk with the woman. The monk, realizing he's been seen, locks the girl in his cell and gives the abbot his key, pretending to go gather faggots.

Guido, quick-witted, replies, ""Gentlemen, you may say what you will to me in your own house,"" then deftly leaps over a tomb to escape them.

One night, Gianni unexpectedly returns while Federigo is waiting outside. Tessa, feigning sleep, then fear of a ""phantom"" at the door, convinces Gianni to help her perform an ""exorcism"" prayer.

The next morning, they return to Florence and disperse, the three young men and seven ladies returning to their previous lives, having found solace and amusement in their storytelling retreat.

**Conclusion of the Author**
The author addresses potential criticisms of his work:
1.  **Immodesty:** He defends the ""license"" in his stories, arguing that unseemly subjects can be expressed with seemly terms. He compares his freedom to a painter's depicting Adam and Eve naked or Christ on the cross, and notes the context (pleasure gardens, not churches or schools) and the mature wit of his audience. He states that stories, like wine or fire, are neutral; their effect depends on the reader's ""disposition.""
2.  **Uneven quality:** He attributes any perceived lack of ""goodliness"" to the individual storytellers, not himself, as he only recorded what was said. He argues that even the best craftsmen (except God) produce varied work, and that variety is natural and necessary.
3.  **Length:** He reminds critics that he wrote for ""idle women"" seeking to ""pass away the time,"" for whom longer stories are better suited than for busy students.
4.  **Quips and cranks:** He notes that friars' sermons often contain such jips, so they are suitable for his purpose of amusing women and curing melancholy.
5.  **Critiques of friars:** He acknowledges that some may call his tongue venomous for telling the truth about friars but dismisses this, implying friars are indeed flawed.
He concludes by thanking God and the ladies, hoping his work has been profitable to them."
The Divine Comedy-Dante Alighieri,"The narrative begins with the protagonist, the narrator, finding himself lost in a ""gloomy wood,"" having strayed from the ""path direct"" in the ""midway of this our mortal life."" Overwhelmed by fear, he attempts to climb a mountain but is blocked by three beasts: a nimble, speckled panther, a hunger-mad lion, and a lean she-wolf. The she-wolf drives him back into the silent sunless region.

A figure appears, whose voice is faint from disuse. The narrator cries for mercy. The figure reveals himself to be Virgil, a bard from Mantua, who lived in Rome under Emperor Augustus and sang of Aeneas. He questions why the narrator is returning to peril instead of ascending the pleasant mountain. Recognizing Virgil, the narrator expresses deep admiration, calls him his ""master and guide,"" and pleads for salvation from the she-wolf.

Virgil explains that the she-wolf is insatiable and allows no one to pass. He prophesies the coming of a ""greyhound"" who will destroy her and bring safety to Italy. Virgil then proposes a path: he will guide the narrator through an ""eternal space"" where he will witness tormented spirits and those who dwell content in fire, hoping for salvation. However, Virgil, being condemned for not adoring God, cannot enter the city of the blessed. He says a ""spirit worthier than I"" must take over there. The narrator, desperate to escape ""this ill and worse,"" agrees to follow Virgil to see Saint Peter's gate and the suffering souls.

**Canto II**
As night falls, the narrator expresses doubt about his worthiness for such a journey, citing that only legendary figures like Aeneas and St. Paul undertook similar ventures while living. Virgil reassures him, explaining that his fear is baseless. He reveals that a ""dame, so blest and lovely"" named Beatrice, seeing the narrator in peril, descended from Heaven to Limbo (where Virgil resides) and implored Virgil to save her friend. Beatrice explained that she fears only evil and is untouched by the misery of Hell. She was moved by the Virgin Mary, who, with Lucia, sought her aid for the narrator. Beatrice, trusting Virgil's eloquence, came to rescue the narrator from the beast. Virgil urges the narrator to abandon fear, reminding him that three blessed ladies (Mary, Lucia, Beatrice) in Heaven care for his safety. Reinvigorated, the narrator reaffirms his resolve, and they enter the ""deep and woody way.""

**Canto III**
They arrive at a gate inscribed with chilling words, ""All hope abandon ye who enter here."" Virgil explains that they are entering the realm of souls doomed to misery, those who have lost ""intellectual good."" Inside, the narrator hears a cacophony of cries, lamentations, and moans. Virgil identifies these as the souls of those who lived ""without or praise or blame"" and angels who were neither rebellious nor faithful to God. Heaven cast them out to preserve its beauty, and Hell refuses them to prevent them from glorying. These wretched souls have no hope of death, envy all other lots, and are unknown to fame. They are pursued by wasps and hornets, their blood and tears mixing with disgusting worms at their feet. The narrator recognizes one who ""abjur’d his high estate"" due to fear.

Further on, they reach the Acheron river, where an old boatman, Charon, with eyes of burning coal, cries out to the wicked spirits, announcing their eternal darkness. He initially refuses to take the living narrator. Virgil silences Charon by stating it is ""will’d, Where will and power are one."" The spirits, hearing this, blaspheme God and their lineage, then one by one descend into Charon's boat like falling leaves, crossing the dark waves. Virgil explains that God's justice goads these souls, turning fear into desire to cross. Suddenly, the gloomy region shakes, a vermilion flame flashes, and the narrator falls unconscious.

**Canto IV**
A loud thunderclap awakens the narrator. He finds himself on the brink of a lamentable, dark abyss filled with innumerable plaints, but he cannot see its bottom. Virgil, pale from pity, leads the way into the ""first circle,"" where only sighs are heard from vast multitudes of men, women, and infants. Virgil explains these souls are blameless of sin but lacked baptism, the ""portal to thy faith."" They live ""Desiring without hope."" The narrator, saddened, asks if anyone has ever been saved from this Limbo. Virgil reveals that ""a puissant one"" (Christ) arrived and drew forth Adam, Abel, Noah, Moses, Abraham, David, Israel, Rachel, and others to bliss, stating that before them, ""No spirit of human kind was ever sav’d.""

They continue through a ""wood"" of spirits and see a prevailing flame, indicating a place of high honor. Here, a voice announces Virgil's return, and four mighty spirits—Homer, Horace, Ovid, and Lucan—greet Virgil as their lord. The narrator is honored by being included as the sixth member of this learned band. They reach a ""magnificent castle,"" with seven walls and a pleasant stream, which they cross. Inside, in a verdant mead, they see ancient heroes and heroines: Electra, Hector, Aeneas, Caesar, Camilla, Penthesilea, King Latinus, Lavinia, Brutus, Lucretia, Marcia, Julia, Cornelia, and a ""Soldan fierce."" The narrator also sees the ""master of the sapient throng"" (Aristotle) surrounded by philosophers like Socrates, Plato, Democritus, and many others. Virgil then leads the narrator away from this serene air into a ""climate ever vex’d with storms,"" where no light shines.

**Canto V**
They descend to the second circle, which contains more grief. Minos, a ghastly monster, examines each arriving soul, wrapping his tail around himself to indicate the degree of descent into Hell. He challenges the narrator's presence, but Virgil silences him, asserting their divinely appointed journey.

Here, ""rueful wailings"" are heard in a place where ""light was silent all."" A tempestuous blast drives ""carnal sinners,"" those whose reason was swayed by lust, in a restless fury. Virgil points out Semiramis, who made vice lawful; Dido, who slew herself for love; Cleopatra; Helen; Achilles; Paris; and Tristan, among ""a thousand more"" taken by love.

Overcome by pity, the narrator asks to speak to two spirits driven together by the wind. Virgil advises him to entreat them by their love. The spirits approach, and one, Francesca da Rimini, thanks the narrator for his pity. She recounts how love, sparked by reading the story of Lancelot, entangled her and her lover (Paolo). When they read of Lancelot kissing Guinevere, Paolo kissed Francesca. ""The book and writer both Were love’s purveyors. In its leaves that day We read no more."" As she speaks, the other spirit wails so sorely that the narrator, heartstruck, faints and falls ""like a corpse.""

**Canto VI**
Reviving, the narrator finds himself in the third circle, enduring a ceaseless, cold, heavy shower of large hail, discolored water, and sleet. The air stinks. Cerberus, a three-throated dog-like monster, barks fiercely, tearing the spirits beneath. Virgil placates Cerberus by casting earth into his maw.

They step over the prostrate shades. One spirit, Ciacco of Florence, recognizes the narrator and identifies himself as damned for gluttony. The narrator asks about the divided state of Florence and its future. Ciacco prophesies that after much struggle, the ""wild party from the woods"" will drive out the other, and the latter will fall within three years, the former rising by ""borrow’d force."" He laments that ""Av’rice, envy, pride, Three fatal sparks,"" have ignited all hearts, and only two just men are neglected. The narrator asks about other good men, but Ciacco says they are in deeper parts of hell for various crimes. Ciacco requests remembrance on Earth and then falls silent, joining his blind companions. Virgil explains that these souls will resume their bodies at the last trumpet. The narrator asks if their tortures will increase, and Virgil states that as things grow more perfect, they feel good and pain more sensibly, so their suffering will intensify. They continue their journey toward a place guarded by Plutus.

**Canto VII**
Plutus greets them with a hoarse, wild exclamation. Virgil silences him, asserting their divinely willed journey. Plutus collapses. They descend to the fourth ledge, where the narrator sees souls pushing great weights, colliding, and shouting, ""Why holdest thou so fast?"" and ""And why castest thou away?"" Virgil explains these are souls distorted by avarice and prodigality. He states that their ""ignoble life"" makes them indiscernible, forever engaged in this futile conflict.

Virgil then expounds on Fortune, God's minister, who justly distributes earthly goods, causing nations to rise and fall beyond human wisdom. He concludes that earthly goods are vain, as not all the world's gold could buy rest for one of these souls. They move on, as night approaches.

They arrive at a boiling well that pours into a dark, inky foss. This stream expands into the Stygian lake, where the narrator sees a ""miry tribe,"" naked and enraged, tearing at each other with fangs. Virgil identifies these as the souls overcome by anger. Beneath the mud, a multitude gurgles sad strains, lamenting their ""lazy mist"" in life, making the surface heave with sighs. They proceed along the embankment until they reach a tower.

**Canto VIII**
At the tower, they see two cressets lit, and another light answers from afar. Virgil says they will soon see what awaits them on the filthy waters. A swift bark, ferried by Phlegyas, approaches. Phlegyas, enraged at their coming, is silenced by Virgil. They board the boat, which sinks deeper than usual under the narrator's living weight.

As they cross, a spirit covered in mud asks the narrator why he comes before his hour. The narrator recognizes him as Filippo Argenti, a Florentine. The narrator expresses disdain, and Virgil pushes Argenti away, praising the narrator's righteous anger. The narrator wishes to see Argenti submerged, and his wish is granted as other muddy spirits set upon Argenti, tearing him.

They approach the city of Dis, whose vermilion minarets glow from eternal fire. At the gates, fallen angels from Heaven demand to know who the living narrator is. Virgil attempts to parley but is rebuffed, and the gates are slammed shut, leaving him dismayed. Virgil reassures the narrator that their passage is divinely permitted and that a powerful, unescorted figure is coming to open the city.

**Canto IX**
The narrator's fear is palpable. Virgil, though troubled by the delay, says they must win this fight and that aid is coming. The narrator asks if any from Limbo ever reach such depths. Virgil explains it is rare, but he once descended, summoned by the sorceress Erictho, to draw a spirit from Judas's circle (the lowest Hell).

As they wait, the narrator sees three hellish Furies, stained with blood, with hydras and serpents for hair, on top of the fiery tower. They claw themselves and cry out for Medusa to turn the narrator to stone. Virgil quickly turns the narrator around and covers his eyes, warning him that seeing the Gorgon would mean he could never return upwards.

A terrible, crashing sound, like an impetuous wind, makes the shores tremble. Virgil uncovers the narrator's eyes, telling him to look through the smoke. More than a thousand spirits flee before a heavenly messenger who walks across the Stygian marsh with unwet feet. The messenger, looking weary, comes to the gate, touches it with a wand, and it flies open. He rebukes the ""Outcasts of heav’n!"" for their insolence and resistance to God's will. Without a word to them, he turns back.

They enter the city unopposed, finding a vast"
The Great Gatsby-F. Scott Fitzgerald,"The story begins with the narrator, Nick Carraway, recalling advice from his father about reserving judgment. Nick, having recently returned from the East in the autumn, expresses a desire for moral order and notes that only Jay Gatsby, the book's namesake, was exempt from his scorn, possessing an extraordinary gift for hope.

Nick describes his family as prominent and well-to-do in the Middle West. After graduating from Yale in 1915 and participating in the Great War, he feels restless and decides to move East in the spring of 1922 to learn the bond business, financed by his father. He rents a small, weather-beaten bungalow in West Egg, a less fashionable but eccentric part of Long Island, situated between two colossal mansions. His immediate neighbor is the mysterious Mr. Gatsby, whose mansion is a factual imitation of a Normandy Hôtel de Ville. Across the courtesy bay lies East Egg, where Nick's second cousin once removed, Daisy Buchanan, and her enormously wealthy husband, Tom Buchanan, live in a cheerful red-and-white Georgian Colonial mansion.

Nick visits the Buchanans. Tom, a sturdy, arrogant man of thirty and a former football star, has a supercilious manner and a gruff voice. Daisy is lovely but sad, with an exciting voice that men find unforgettable. They are joined by Jordan Baker, a professional golfer with an erect carriage and a ""contemptuous expression."" During dinner, Tom expresses racist views, citing a book called ""The Rise of the Coloured Empires"" and arguing for the dominance of the ""Nordic race."" Daisy makes an unconvincing attempt at distraction with a story about the butler’s nose. A phone call during dinner reveals Tom's affair; Jordan informs Nick that Tom has ""some woman in New York."" Daisy, visibly affected, later confides in Nick that she's had a ""very bad time"" and is cynical. She recounts saying she hoped her daughter would be ""a beautiful little fool"" when she was born. After dinner, Jordan explains to Nick that he lives next door to Gatsby, and she recognizes Gatsby's name. Nick sees Gatsby for the first time that night, standing alone on his lawn, stretching his arms towards a single green light at the end of a distant dock across the bay.

Some time later, Nick travels to New York with Tom. On the way, they stop in the ""valley of ashes,"" a desolate industrial wasteland overseen by the gigantic eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg on a billboard. Tom forces Nick to get off the train to meet his mistress, Myrtle Wilson, at her husband George Wilson's garage. George Wilson is a blond, spiritless man, anaemic and unprosperous. Myrtle is in her middle thirties, faintly stout but possesses an immediate vitality. She walks ""through her husband as if he were a ghost"" and interacts intimately with Tom, who arranges for her to meet him on the next train to New York. George Wilson believes Myrtle goes to New York to see her sister.

In New York, Myrtle, having changed into a brown dress, insists on buying a dog. She, Tom, and Nick take a taxi to an apartment on 158th Street, which Tom keeps for his affair. The apartment is small and crowded with oversized furniture. Nick gets drunk for the second time in his life. Guests arrive: Myrtle's sister, Catherine, a slender, worldly woman; and Mr. and Mrs. McKee, a pale, feminine photographer and his ""shrill, languid, handsome, and horrible"" wife. Myrtle changes into an elaborate cream-colored chiffon dress, her personality transforming into ""impressive hauteur."" The guests discuss Gatsby; Catherine claims he is a nephew or cousin of Kaiser Wilhelm and that's where his money comes from. She also whispers to Nick that neither Tom nor Myrtle can stand their spouses, and if they could get divorces (Myrtle claims Daisy is Catholic and doesn't believe in divorce, which Nick knows is a lie), they would marry each other and go West. Myrtle recounts meeting Tom on a train. Later, an argument erupts between Tom and Myrtle over her mentioning Daisy's name. Tom violently breaks Myrtle's nose with his open hand. Nick leaves the apartment with Mr. McKee, who mentions he almost married a ""little kike"" before Chester.

Gatsby's lavish parties continue through the summer nights. People attend uninvited, treating the mansion like an amusement park. Nick, however, receives a formal invitation from Gatsby. At his first party, Nick feels out of place. He finds Jordan Baker, who remembers him. They sit with two girls in yellow dresses and three men, and discuss rumors about Gatsby: he killed a man, he was a German spy, he's an Oxford man. Jordan leads Nick to find Gatsby, and they encounter a stout, owl-eyed man in Gatsby's Gothic library, who is astonished to discover the books are real. Later, at a table, a man recognizes Nick from the war and offers him a ride in his hydroplane. This man then reveals he is Gatsby. Gatsby, a young roughneck in his early thirties with an elaborate formality of speech, possesses a rare, reassuring smile. He is called away by a phone call from Chicago. Jordan tells Nick that Gatsby claims to be an Oxford man but she doesn't believe it. Gatsby's butler later summons Jordan to speak with Gatsby alone. Nick observes Gatsby, who stands apart from the boisterous guests, not drinking. As the party ends, a car crashes outside Gatsby's drive, its wheel detached, driven by the owl-eyed man, who confesses he wasn't driving.

Nick reflects on his own life, working in New York and having a brief affair. He notices Jordan Baker's dishonesty, recalling a story about her moving a golf ball during a tournament. Despite this, he is drawn to her, but also cautious due to a prior understanding with a girl back home. He asserts himself as one of the few honest people he knows.

On a morning in late July, Gatsby picks Nick up in his luxurious yellow car. Gatsby attempts to tell Nick about his background, claiming to be from a wealthy Midwest family (now dead), educated at Oxford, a war hero with decorations from every Allied government (including Montenegro), and a world traveler. Nick is initially skeptical, especially when Gatsby says he's from ""San Francisco"" in the Midwest, but Gatsby produces a medal and an Oxford photo, which convinces Nick. Gatsby reveals he has a ""big request"" and wants Nick to arrange a tea meeting with Daisy. Gatsby's car is stopped by a policeman, but Gatsby shows him a white card, and the policeman lets them go. In New York, Nick has lunch with Gatsby and Meyer Wolfshiem, a ""gambler"" who Gatsby reveals ""fixed the World's Series back in 1919."" Wolfshiem attempts to discuss a ""business gonnegtion"" with Nick, but Gatsby interjects. Tom Buchanan appears, and Gatsby abruptly leaves.

Jordan Baker then recounts Daisy's past to Nick. In 1917, Daisy Fay was a popular young woman in Louisville who fell in love with a penniless officer, Jay Gatsby. Before her wedding to Tom Buchanan, Daisy received a letter (presumably from Gatsby) that made her incredibly drunk and determined to call off the wedding, wanting to return a $350,000 pearl necklace from Tom. However, she was eventually convinced to go through with it and married Tom the next day. Tom had an affair with a chambermaid early in their marriage. Jordan reveals that Gatsby bought his mansion across the bay specifically to be near Daisy, hoping she would wander into one of his parties. Gatsby has now asked Nick to invite Daisy to tea, so he can ""come over"" to Nick's house and see her. Nick agrees and, feeling a romantic connection, invites Jordan to dinner.

The next night, Gatsby's house is lit up ""from tower to cellar."" Nick tells Gatsby he has arranged the tea. Gatsby attempts to offer Nick a confidential business opportunity, which Nick declines. Nick calls Daisy, inviting her to tea and explicitly telling her not to bring Tom. The day of the tea is rainy. Gatsby sends his gardener to cut Nick's lawn and delivers flowers. Gatsby arrives, dressed in a white flannel suit, silver shirt, and gold-colored tie, looking pale and sleepless. Daisy arrives, ecstatic to see Nick. Gatsby, overwhelmed, disappears into the kitchen. Daisy and Nick are alone until Gatsby returns. The reunion is awkward; Gatsby almost topples a clock. After an embarrassing silence, Nick leaves them alone. When he returns, all embarrassment is gone; Daisy's face is tear-streaked, and Gatsby ""literally glowed."" Gatsby shows Daisy his house, including his vast collection of expensive shirts, which makes Daisy cry, lamenting she has never seen such beautiful shirts. Gatsby points out the green light on Daisy's dock, revealing its symbolic significance as his long-held dream object, which now ""had vanished forever"" upon Daisy's actual presence. Gatsby also shows them a photograph of Dan Cody and clippings about Daisy. Klipspringer, the ""boarder,"" is called to play the piano. As Gatsby gazes at Daisy, Nick observes that Daisy ""tumbled short of his dreams"" not due to her fault, but because of the ""colossal vitality of his illusion."" Gatsby and Daisy seem absorbed in each other, forgetting Nick.

Gatsby's parties cease after this. He dismisses his servants, replacing them with people connected to Wolfshiem, to prevent gossip as Daisy visits frequently. Nick is invited to lunch at the Buchanans' house. The day is stiflingly hot. During lunch, the phone rings, and Jordan whispers it's Tom's mistress. Tom, annoyed, argues on the phone. Daisy then kisses Gatsby openly, declaring her love. Daisy's three-year-old daughter, Pammy, is brought into the room, whom Gatsby looks at with surprise, as if he never truly believed in her existence. Tom, realizing the affair, suggests they all go to town. Daisy provocatively tells Gatsby he looks ""so cool,"" confirming her feelings to Tom. Tom, enraged, insists on driving Gatsby's yellow car, while Gatsby takes Daisy in Tom's blue coupé.

On the way to town, Tom, driving Gatsby's car with Nick and Jordan, angrily questions Gatsby's background, dismissing his ""Oxford man"" claim and accusing him of being a bootlegger involved in illegal ""drugstores"" with Meyer Wolfshiem. They stop for gas at George Wilson's garage in the valley of ashes. Wilson looks sick and reveals he has discovered his wife's infidelity and is taking her West. Myrtle, from an upstairs window, misinterprets Jordan Baker as Tom's wife and looks at her with ""jealous terror."" As they leave, Myrtle rushes out into the road and is instantly killed by a passing yellow car.

Tom, Jordan, and Nick arrive at the scene of the accident. Tom is distraught by Myrtle's death. Wilson is consumed by grief, repeatedly crying ""Oh, my God!"" A witness describes the ""big yellow car"" that hit Myrtle and did not stop. Tom, quickly deflecting suspicion from himself (as he was driving Gatsby's yellow car earlier), identifies his car as blue and states he just arrived from New York. He tells Wilson that the driver of the yellow car ""had it coming to him.""

Tom drives Nick and Jordan back to East Egg. Nick sees Gatsby hiding in the bushes outside the Buchanan house. Gatsby reveals that Daisy was driving the yellow car that hit Myrtle, but he will take the blame. Daisy, nervous from the confrontation in town, had insisted on driving. Gatsby explains that Myrtle rushed out, possibly thinking they were someone else, and Daisy ""lost her nerve"" and couldn't stop. Gatsby pulled the emergency brake and took the wheel, then drove away. Gatsby plans to wait outside all night to ensure Tom doesn't harm Daisy. Nick then observes Tom and Daisy through a window, sitting intimately at a kitchen table, appearing to be conspiring. Nick concludes it's ""all quiet"" and advises Gatsby to go home, but Gatsby refuses, preferring to wait.

The next morning, Nick finds Gatsby still waiting. Gatsby reveals Daisy came to her window at 4 AM, then turned off the light. Nick urges Gatsby to go away, as his car will be traced, but Gatsby refuses to leave Daisy. Gatsby tells Nick the full story of his youth: his true name, James Gatz, and how he met Dan Cody, who gave him his education and the foundation of his fortune, but whose legacy was stolen by Ella Kaye. He recounts meeting Daisy five years prior as a penniless officer, allowing her to believe he was wealthy and capable of providing for her. He fell in love and felt ""married to her,"" but she married Tom Buchanan when Gatsby was at Oxford, seeking a ""decision"" and drawn to Tom's ""wholesome bulkiness"" and wealth. Nick tells Gatsby he is ""worth the whole damn bunch put together.""

Gatsby's father, Henry C. Gatz, arrives from Minnesota for the funeral, dismayed but proud, carrying a photograph of Gatsby's house and a childhood schedule of self-improvement goals. However, almost none of Gatsby's many acquaintances attend the funeral. Klipspringer, ""the boarder,"" calls Nick, but only to retrieve a pair of tennis shoes, refusing to attend the funeral. Meyer Wolfshiem also refuses to come, claiming he doesn't want to get ""mixed up in it."" Nick receives a phone call from a man named Slagle, inquiring about ""Young Parke"" who was arrested for bond fraud, indicating Gatsby's illegal business dealings. The funeral is sparsely attended, only Nick, Mr. Gatz, the minister, and Owl Eyes are present.

After Gatsby's death, Nick decides to return West. He breaks up with Jordan Baker, who accuses him of carelessness. Nick confronts Tom, who admits he told George Wilson that Gatsby was driving the yellow car that killed Myrtle, justifying his actions by saying Gatsby ""had it coming."" Tom believed Gatsby ran Myrtle over ""like you'd run over a dog and never even stopped his car."" Nick realizes Tom and Daisy are ""careless people"" who ""smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness."" Nick shakes Tom's hand, feeling as though he is talking to a child, before leaving him to buy a pearl necklace. Nick returns to Gatsby's empty house, where he erases an obscene word scrawled on the steps. He reflects on Gatsby's dream, the ""green light,"" and the futility of trying to recapture the past, concluding that humans are ""borne back ceaselessly into the past."""
The Iliad-Homer,"Here is a detailed plot summary of the provided text, ""The Iliad,"" strictly adhering to the events and information contained within it:

**Book I: The Contention of Achilles and Agamemnon**

The narrative opens in the tenth year of the siege of Troy. The Greeks, having sacked neighboring towns, captured two beautiful women: Chryseïs, allotted to Agamemnon, and Briseïs, allotted to Achilles. Chryses, a priest of Apollo and father of Chryseïs, arrives at the Greek camp with costly gifts to ransom his daughter. Agamemnon rudely refuses and dismisses him. Chryses then prays to Apollo for vengeance, and Apollo inflicts a pestilence on the Greeks.

Achilles calls a council, and the prophet Chalcas, encouraged by Achilles' promise of protection, declares that Apollo's rage is due to Agamemnon's refusal to release Chryseïs. Agamemnon, though furious, is obliged to send his captive back to appease the god. In revenge, he seizes Briseïs from Achilles. Enraged and insulted, Achilles withdraws himself and his forces (the Myrmidons) from the Greek army.

Achilles complains to his mother, Thetis, a sea goddess. She ascends to Olympus and supplicates Jupiter, asking him to grant victory to the Trojans, thereby making the Greeks realize the wrong done to her son and causing them to suffer great losses until they honor Achilles. Jupiter grants her suit by nodding, a powerful and irrevocable sign. This incenses Juno, Jupiter's wife, leading to a high-pitched debate between them. Vulcan intervenes and reconciles his parents, advising Juno to submit to Jupiter's will to avoid further conflict.

This book covers a period of twenty-two days: nine days of plague, one day for the council and quarrel, and twelve days during which Jupiter was with the Æthiopians before Thetis presented her petition.

**Book II: The Trial of the Army, and Catalogue of the Forces**

In accordance with Thetis' request, Jupiter sends a deceitful vision, appearing as old Nestor, to Agamemnon. The vision urges Agamemnon to lead the Greek army into battle, claiming that the gods have ended their contention and Troy is fated to fall immediately. Agamemnon, though deluded by the prospect of taking Troy, fears the army's morale is low due to Achilles' absence, the recent plague, and the long siege. He devises a stratagem: he will propose returning to Greece to test their disposition, and expects the princes to stop them.

Agamemnon communicates this plan to the other Greek princes in council. He then assembles the entire army and proposes that they give up the siege and return home. The soldiers enthusiastically agree and rush to prepare their ships for departure.

Juno, seeing the Greeks about to abandon the siege, sends Pallas (Minerva) to prevent their flight. Pallas finds Ulysses, who is also distraught at the prospect of retreat. She encourages him to recall the armies. Ulysses, taking Agamemnon's sceptre, runs through the ranks. He praises the chiefs to encourage them and uses the sceptre to chastise common soldiers who voice dissent, notably Thersites, a loquacious and ugly man whom Ulysses strikes with the sceptre, making him cry.

The assembly is recalled. Ulysses reminds the Greeks of the prophecy given by Calchas at Aulis, where a serpent devoured eight young birds and their mother (the ninth), signifying that after nine years of toil, Troy would fall in the tenth. He urges them to remain and fight. Nestor supports Ulysses' advice, urging a general muster of troops, divided by their respective nations, before proceeding to battle.

Agamemnon approves Nestor's advice. The Greek army prepares for battle, offering sacrifices (though Jove rejects Agamemnon's prayer for Troy's fall). Pallas (Minerva) inspires each Greek warrior. A vast catalogue of Greek forces follows, detailing their leaders, places of origin, and the number of ships they brought.

Meanwhile, Iris, sent by Jupiter, warns the Trojan chiefs, appearing in the guise of Polites (Priam's son). She tells Hector that a massive Greek army is approaching and urges him to assemble all Trojan and allied forces. Hector rallies his troops. A detailed catalogue of Trojan and auxiliary forces, with their leaders and origins, is then provided.

The armies gather on the plain before Troy.

**Book III: The Duel of Menelaus and Paris**

The two armies advance, the Trojans with shouts and the Greeks in disciplined silence. Paris, wearing a panther hide and carrying a bow and spears, steps out from the Trojan ranks and challenges any Greek to single combat. Menelaus, seeing Paris, is filled with joy and leaps from his chariot to confront him. Paris, however, shrinks back in fear and retreats into the Trojan ranks.

Hector, observing his brother's cowardice, publicly shames Paris, criticizing his looks and his actions, and blaming him for the war. Paris accepts the rebuke and proposes a single combat between himself and Menelaus to decide the war. The victor will take Helen and all the treasures she brought, and the two nations will establish a lasting peace. Hector relays this challenge to the Greeks.

Menelaus accepts the challenge, proposing that Priam and Agamemnon make a solemn oath to guarantee the terms. Two lambs (one black for Earth, one white for the Sun) and a third for Jove are prepared for the sacrifice.

Iris, disguised as Laodice (Priam's daughter), goes to the palace to find Helen at her loom, weaving scenes of the Trojan War. Iris tells Helen about the impending duel. Helen, filled with longing for her former husband and home, goes to the Scaean gate, accompanied by her handmaids. There, Priam and the other Trojan elders are seated. The elders, though recognizing Helen's beauty as the cause of their suffering, admit her irresistible charm.

Priam kindly invites Helen to sit beside him and points out various Greek leaders on the plain below. Helen identifies Agamemnon, Ulysses, and Ajax. She laments the absence of her brothers, Castor and Pollux, unaware they are dead.

Heralds bring the sacrificial lambs and wine. Priam and Agamemnon come forward and, holding portions of the victims' hair, swear a solemn oath to Jove, Earth, Sun, and the Furies, agreeing to the terms of the duel. Priam then leaves, unable to bear watching the combat involving his son.

Hector and Ulysses mark out the ground for the duel. Lots are cast to determine who throws first; Paris's lot leaps out. Paris arms himself in resplendent armor. Menelaus also dons his armor.

Paris throws his spear first, but it strikes Menelaus's shield and is blunted. Menelaus then throws his spear, which pierces Paris's shield and corslet, but Paris quickly bends aside, avoiding a fatal wound. Menelaus then draws his sword and strikes Paris's helmet, but the sword shatters. Enraged, Menelaus seizes Paris by the helmet crest and begins dragging him towards the Greek lines.

Venus intervenes, breaking the helmet strap and rescuing Paris in a cloud of mist, transporting him to his perfumed chamber in Troy. Venus then appears to Helen, disguised as an old wool-worker, and urges her to go to Paris. Helen, recognizing the goddess, initially resists, reproaching Venus for her constant deceptions and expressing disdain for Paris's cowardice. Venus threatens Helen with divine wrath, and Helen reluctantly obeys.

Helen returns to Paris, where she again reproaches him for his flight from battle. Paris, however, embraces her, stating they may yet be victorious another day and urging her to enjoy the pleasures of love.

Meanwhile, Agamemnon, unable to find Paris, proclaims Menelaus the victor and demands the return of Helen and the treasures, as stipulated by the oath. The Greeks loudly applaud.

**Book IV: The Breach of the Truce, and the First Battle**

In the council of the gods, Jupiter teases Juno and Minerva for being mere spectators while Venus actively aids Paris. Juno, still full of animosity towards Troy, complains bitterly to Jupiter about the potential for peace and the ongoing favoritism towards the Trojans. Jupiter, though rebuking her, eventually permits Minerva to break the truce.

Minerva descends from Olympus and, disguised as Laodocus, finds Pandarus (a skilled archer) among the Trojan ranks. She persuades him to shoot an arrow at Menelaus, promising him glory and rich rewards from Troy. Pandarus, swayed by the goddess, draws his bow and shoots Menelaus.

The arrow pierces Menelaus's belt and corslet, grazing his skin and drawing blood. Agamemnon is filled with horror and grief, fearing Menelaus's death and the breaking of the truce. Menelaus reassures him that the wound is not mortal. Agamemnon sends Talthybius to fetch Machaon, the physician, who extracts the arrow and applies a soothing balm, healing the wound.

With the truce broken, the Trojans rush to renewed battle. Agamemnon, enraged, actively rallies the Greek troops. He praises the brave, like Idomeneus and the Ajaxes, and sternly reproaches those he finds hesitant, such as Ulysses and Diomed. Nestor is lauded for his orderly command.

The battle joins fiercely. Antilochus kills Echepolus. Agenor wounds Antilochus. Ajax slays Simoisius. Antiphus throws a spear at Ajax, misses, and kills Leucus (a friend of Ulysses). Ulysses, enraged, kills Democoon (a son of Priam).

Hector then leads a counter-attack, driving the Greeks back. Apollo encourages the Trojans from Ilion's towers. Pyrus kills Diores, and Thoas kills Pyrus, though he is forced to retreat by the Thracians. The battle rages with many heroes falling on both sides.

**Book V: The Acts of Diomed**

Pallas (Minerva) inspires Diomed with extraordinary courage and strength, making him shine brightly in battle. He first kills Phegeus and nearly kills Idæus (sons of Dares), but Vulcan saves Idæus by cloaking him in a smoky cloud. Minerva then persuades Mars to temporarily withdraw from the battle, and she too retires.

The Greeks continue their advance, and many Trojan chiefs fall to various Greek heroes, including Odius (by Agamemnon), Phæstus (by Idomeneus), Scamandrius (by Menelaus), Phereclus (by Merion), Pedaeus (by Meges), and Hypsenor (by Eurypylus).

Diomed, raging across the plain, is then wounded in the shoulder by an arrow from Pandarus. Diomed prays to Pallas, who not only cures his wound but also gives him the power to distinguish gods from mortals and instructs him to attack only Venus if she enters the fight, but to avoid all other deities.

Diomed returns to battle with tenfold fury, killing Astynous and Hypenor, then Abas and Polyidus, and Xanthus and Thoon (sons of Phaenops), and two unnamed sons of Priam.

Æneas, observing Diomed's rampage, seeks out Pandarus and urges him to confront Diomed again. They mount a chariot. Pandarus hurls his spear at Diomed, striking his shield but failing to pierce it. Diomed throws his spear, piercing Pandarus's face and killing him.

Æneas dismounts to protect Pandarus's body. Diomed then hurls a massive stone, striking Æneas in the hip and severely wounding him. As Æneas collapses, Venus rushes to rescue her son, shielding him with her white arms and veil. Diomed, remembering Pallas's command, pursues Venus and wounds her hand with his spear. Venus, shrieking, drops Æneas. Apollo then rescues Æneas in a cloud and carries him to the temple of Pergamus in Troy, where Latona and Phoebe heal him.

Diomed taunts Venus, telling her to leave war to Mars and Pallas. Venus, weeping, flies to Olympus, where her mother Dione comforts her, reminds her that gods also suffer from mortals, and heals her wound. Juno and Pallas mock Venus, and Jupiter tells Venus to stick to love, not war.

Back on the battlefield, Apollo places a phantom of Æneas, in his likeness, to keep the Trojans fighting. Apollo then urges Mars (who had returned) to rally the Trojans. Mars, disguised as Acamas, inspires Hector and the other Trojans. Sarpedon, a Lycian ally and son of Jove, reproaches Hector for his wavering leadership and urges him to fight. Hector, stung, leaps from his chariot and rallies his forces.

Mars and Bellona join the Trojan side. Æneas, now healed and reinvigorated, also returns to the battle. Agamemnon attempts to rally the Greeks. Diomed kills Deicoon. Æneas kills Orsilochus and Crethon. Menelaus confronts Æneas, but Antilochus intervenes, and Æneas wisely withdraws.

Menelaus kills Pylæmenes. Antilochus kills Mydon. Hector rallies his troops again, and Diomed advises the Greeks to retreat slowly, recognizing Mars' presence among the Trojans. Hector kills Anchialus and Mnesthes. Ajax kills Amphius.

Tlepolemus, son of Hercules, challenges Sarpedon, son of Jove. They exchange spears; Sarpedon kills Tlepolemus, but Tlepolemus wounds Sarpedon in the thigh. Sarpedon is carried from the field by his Lycian comrades, the spear still in his leg. Glaucus, observing, is filled with grief. Ulysses then slaughters several Lycian chiefs. Hector arrives, and Sarpedon, despite his wound, implores Hector to defend his body.

Sarpedon is laid under a beech tree, and Pelagon removes the spear from his thigh. Boreas revives him. The Greeks slowly retreat, still fighting. Many more heroes fall to Mars and Hector.

Juno and Minerva descend from Olympus in their chariot, armed for battle. Juno (disguised as Stentor) rallies the Greeks, while Minerva rebukes Diomed for his hesitation. Diomed explains he only hesitated because she forbade him to fight gods. Minerva encourages him to attack Mars again, and she joins him in his chariot, covering herself with Hades' helmet.

Diomed, guided by Minerva, wounds Mars in the groin with a spear. Mars bellows in pain and flees to Olympus, creating a dark cloud. Jove rebukes Mars for his constant conflict but has Pæon heal his wound. Juno and Pallas then return to Olympus.

**Book VI: The Episodes of Glaucus and Diomed, and of Hector and Andromache**

With the gods withdrawn, the Greeks gain the upper hand. Ajax kills Acamas. Diomed kills Axylus and his servant Calesius. Euryalus kills Dresus, Opheltius, and two sons of Bucolion. Polypoetes kills Astyalus. Ulysses kills Pidytes. Teucer kills Aretaon. Nestor's son kills Ablerus. Agamemnon kills Elatus. Eurypylus kills Melanthius. Leitus makes Phylacus flee.

Menelaus captures Adrastus alive, who begs for ransom. Agamemnon, however, intervenes and forces Menelaus to kill Adrastus, stating that no Trojan should be spared. Nestor then urges the Greeks to prioritize fighting over stripping spoils.

The Trojan chief augur, Helenus, instructs Hector to return to Troy and tell his mother, Hecuba, to lead the Trojan matrons in a solemn procession to Minerva's temple, offering her a rich mantle and twelve heifers, to entreat the goddess to remove Diomed from the battle. Hector obeys and leaves the field.

During Hector's absence, Glaucus (Lycian ally) and Diomed meet between the armies. Diomed, wary of fighting a god, asks Glaucus about his lineage. Glaucus recounts his illustrious ancestry, tracing it from Sisyphus through Bellerophon (who performed mighty deeds like killing the Chimera and fighting the Solymæans and Amazons). He states his father is Hippolochus and that he came to Troy to win renown.

Diomed realizes that their grandfathers, Œneus and Bellerophon, had a guest-friendship. Honoring this ancient bond, they vow not to fight each other and exchange armor as a token of their renewed friendship. Glaucus, in a moment of folly, exchanges his golden armor for Diomed's bronze armor.

Hector arrives in Troy. He is greeted by anxious Trojan women. His mother, Hecuba, offers him wine, but he refuses it, explaining he is too stained with blood to make an offering to the gods. He instructs her to perform the sacrifice and prayers to Minerva as Helenus advised. Hector then goes to Paris's palace, where he finds Paris polishing his arms, accompanied by Helen. Hector sternly reproaches Paris for his inaction.

Paris accepts the blame, stating he was lost in grief, but now feels inspired to fight. Helen also reproaches Paris and laments her own beauty as the cause of so much suffering, expressing a wish that she had died before causing the war. She urges Hector to rest. Hector refuses, stating his duty is on the battlefield, but says he will first visit his wife and son.

Hector finds Andromache, his wife, and their infant son, Astyanax (also called Scamandrius), at the Scaean gate, watching the battle. Andromache, distraught, pleads with Hector not to return to the field, fearing his death and the inevitable doom of Troy and their son, as her own family had been destroyed by Achilles. Hector explains his unwavering duty to fight for Troy, stating he cannot avoid his fate and foresees the day when Troy will fall and Andromache will be led into captivity. He prays to Jove for Astyanax to become a great warrior. He then kisses his son and comforts Andromache before returning to battle. Andromache, heartbroken, returns home to mourn him as if he were already dead.

Paris, now fully armed and radiant, joins Hector, and they both return to the battlefield, Paris apologizes for his delay. Hector, while acknowledging Paris's courage, again urges him to share the toil of war.

**Book VII: The Single Combat of Hector and Ajax**

Hector and Paris return to the battle, revitalizing the Trojan forces. Paris kills Menestheus, Hector kills Eioneus, and Glaucus kills Iphinous. Minerva, seeing the renewed Trojan advance, descends from Olympus. Apollo meets her near the Scaean gate. They agree to pause the general battle for the day and incite Hector to challenge a Greek to single combat. Helenus, the seer, overhears their counsel and urges Hector to issue the challenge, assuring him that fate will not allow him to die this day.

Hector proposes a single combat to the Greeks. The Greeks are initially silent, fearing Hector. Menelaus, burning with indignation, offers to fight, but Agamemnon restrains him, reminding him of Hector's superior strength and Achilles' fear of him. Nestor then shames the Greeks for their hesitation, recalling his own youthful prowess. Nine Greek chiefs volunteer to fight Hector: Agamemnon, Diomed, Ajax Telamon, Ajax Oïleus, Idomeneus, Merion, Eurypylus, Thoas, and Ulysses.

Lots are drawn, and the lot falls to Ajax Telamon. Ajax arms himself in shining armor and confronts Hector. They exchange defiant words. Hector throws his spear first, striking Ajax's sevenfold shield. Ajax then throws his spear, which penetrates Hector's shield and corslet, but Hector manages to avoid a fatal wound. They then draw their javelins and close. Ajax wounds Hector in the neck, drawing blood. Hector then hurls a massive stone at Ajax's shield. Ajax retaliates with an even larger stone, striking Hector and causing him to fall. Apollo quickly restores Hector's strength. As they are about to draw their swords for close combat, two heralds, Idæus for Troy and Talthybius for Greece, intervene, declaring that night has fallen and they must cease fighting.

Ajax agrees that Hector, as the challenger, should decide. Hector proposes that they cease combat and exchange gifts as a sign of respect. Hector gives Ajax a sword, and Ajax gives Hector a purple belt. Both heroes return to their respective armies, who greet them with joy and relief.

At a Greek council, Nestor advises them to burn their dead and then build a fortified wall with a ditch and palisades around their ships and camp for defense. In Troy, at Priam's palace, Antenor suggests returning Helen and the treasures to the Greeks. Paris rejects returning Helen but offers to return the treasures he brought and add more Trojan wealth. Priam then proposes to the council to send Idæus to the Greeks with Paris's offer and a request for a truce to bury the dead.

Idæus delivers the message to the Greeks. Diomed strongly rejects Paris's offer of wealth, stating that Troy is doomed to fall by conquest. Agamemnon agrees to the truce for the burial of the dead but rejects any peace treaty based on Paris's offer.

The Greeks and Trojans then gather wood and bury their dead. The Greeks, following Nestor's advice, construct a strong wall with towers, gates, a deep ditch, and palisades to protect their fleet. Neptune is angered by this, fearing that the wall will overshadow his own past work for Laomedon. Jupiter reassures Neptune that he will eventually destroy the Greek wall. Both armies feast. Jupiter disheartens the Trojans with thunder and other ominous signs, and they pass the night under arms.

**Book VIII: The Second Battle, and the Distress of the Greeks**

At dawn, Jupiter convenes a council of the gods. He sternly forbids any deity from intervening in the battle, threatening severe punishment (being cast into Tartarus) for disobedience. Minerva obtains permission only to offer counsel to the Greeks, not direct aid. Jupiter then takes his chariot to Mount Ida, where he weighs the fates of Greece and Troy on golden scales; the Greek scale sinks. He unleashes thunder and lightning, terrifying the Greeks and giving momentum to the Trojans.

The Greeks retreat under this divine assault. Nestor's horse is wounded by an arrow from Paris. Diomed courageously rescues Nestor from Hector's charge. As Diomed attempts to pursue Hector, Jupiter casts a lightning bolt in front of his chariot, forcing Diomed and Nestor to retreat. Hector, emboldened, boasts of his impending victory and his plan to burn the Greek fleet.

Juno, seeing the Greek distress, tries to persuade Neptune to aid them, but he refuses to defy Jupiter. Agamemnon, disheartened, prays to Jupiter. Jupiter sends an eagle as a favorable omen, which encourages the Greeks.

The Greeks rally and push back. Diomed breaks through the Trojan ranks, killing Agelaus. Other Greek chiefs, including the Atridae, the Ajaxes, Merion, Idomeneus, Eurypylus, and Teucer, cross the trench. Teucer, shielded by Ajax Telamon, kills many Trojans with his arrows but fails to hit Hector. One of Teucer's arrows kills Gorgythio (Priam's son), and another kills Archeptolemus (Hector's charioteer). Hector, enraged, has Cebriones take the reins, then dismounts and attacks Teucer with a large stone, breaking his bow. Ajax and Mecistheus carry the wounded Teucer from the field.

The Trojans advance again, driving the Greeks back to their fortifications. Hector leads the fierce assault. Juno and Minerva prepare to intervene again in their chariot, but Iris, sent by Jupiter, intercepts them. She warns them of Jupiter's severe threats and forces them to return to Olympus. Jupiter then returns to Olympus, rebukes Juno and Pallas, and reiterates his plan for the battle: Hector will continue to drive the Greeks back until the ships are burning, leading to Patroclus's death, which will then incite Achilles to return to battle and kill Hector, ultimately leading to Troy's fall.

Night falls, ending the battle. The Trojans, confident of victory, decide to camp on the plain outside their walls, lighting numerous fires to prevent the Greeks from escaping by sea during the night. Hector gives orders to maintain the watch and prepare for a decisive assault on the ships at dawn.

**Book IX: The Embassy to Achilles**

While the Trojans celebrate their success and maintain watch with many fires on the plain, the Greeks are filled with fear and despair. Agamemnon, weeping, proposes to the assembled chiefs that they abandon the siege and return to Greece, admitting Jove's judgment is against them.

Diomed vehemently opposes this, declaring that he will stay and fight to conquer Troy, even if all others depart. Nestor praises Diomed's spirit and advises strengthening the night guards. He then suggests a council of elders to devise a new plan, specifically proposing to send an embassy to Achilles to reconcile him with gifts.

Agamemnon agrees, offering Achilles immense treasures: seven tripods, ten talents of gold, twenty shining vases, twelve horses, seven beautiful Lesbian women (including Briseïs, whom he solemnly swears he never touched), and further promises of twenty more Trojan women, one of his daughters in marriage, and seven rich cities as a dowry if Troy falls.

Ulysses, Ajax, and the aged Phoenix are chosen as ambassadors, accompanied by two heralds. They proceed to Achilles' tent, where they find him playing the lyre with Patroclus. Achilles welcomes them warmly, setting out a feast.

After the meal, Ulysses delivers Agamemnon's offer, reminding Achilles of his father Peleus's advice to curb his anger and be gentle. He emphasizes the desperate state of the Greeks and the dire threat posed by Hector.

Achilles rejects all the offers outright. He expresses his deep hatred for Agamemnon, recounting how his previous labors were rewarded only by the seizure of Briseïs. He states that fighting or not fighting yields the same reward (death), and that he will return to his homeland, Phthia, in three days. He declares he will not fight until Hector sets fire to his own ships. He allows Phoenix, his old tutor, to remain with him.

Ajax then speaks, appealing to Achilles' sense of friendship and honor, arguing that even the death of a brother can be atoned for with gifts, and that Achilles should consider the plight of his friends. Achilles responds that he respects Ajax but his rage against Agamemnon is too deep. He reiterates his refusal to fight until the Trojan flames threaten his own ships.

The ambassadors return to Agamemnon's tent, and Ulysses reports Achilles' unyielding refusal and his intention to sail home. Diomed reaffirms his stance that the Greeks should fight regardless, as Achilles will fight when his spirit moves him. The Greeks then take refreshment and go to sleep.

**Book X: The Night-Adventure of Diomed and Ulysses**

Agamemnon, unable to sleep due to anxiety for the Greek army, rises and decides to consult with Nestor. Menelaus, also sleepless, meets Agamemnon and informs him that he was already on his way to check the guards. Agamemnon sends Menelaus to wake Ajax and Idomeneus, while he goes to Nestor.

Agamemnon finds Nestor awake and armed. Nestor advises waking other key chiefs. Nestor then proceeds to wake Ulysses and Diomed. Diomed is already fully armed. The chiefs gather near the sentinels. Nestor proposes sending a spy into the Trojan camp to gather intelligence.

Diomed volunteers for the dangerous mission but requests a companion. Several heroes offer, but Agamemnon urges Diomed to choose carefully. Diomed selects Ulysses, praising his wisdom and courage, noting that Pallas (Minerva) protects him. They arm themselves: Diomed takes a simple helmet and a hide shield, while Ulysses takes a bow, a quiver of arrows, a sword, and a boar's-tusk helmet from Merion. Pallas sends a heron as a favorable omen, and they pray for success.

Meanwhile, Hector also holds a council, offering Achilles' chariot and immortal horses as a prize to any Trojan who volunteers to spy on the Greek camp. Dolon, a swift but unattractive youth, volunteers, explicitly requesting Achilles' horses. Hector swears an oath (though in vain, as Jove will not honor it) to grant him the prize. Dolon sets out, dressed in a wolf's hide.

Ulysses and Diomed spot Dolon and allow him to pass them before pursuing him. Diomed throws his spear, intentionally missing, which causes Dolon to stop in terror. They capture him. Dolon begs for his life, offering a rich ransom. Ulysses questions him about Trojan plans, revealing that Hector promised him Achilles' horses. Dolon discloses the dispositions of the Trojan and allied forces, mentioning that the Thracian king Rhesus has recently arrived with magnificent, white, swift horses and golden armor, and is encamped separately at the furthest part of the Trojan lines.

Diomed, to prevent Dolon from ever betraying them again, kills him. They strip his wolf-skin helmet, bow, and spear, dedicating them to Pallas. They then proceed to the Thracian camp.

Ulysses spots Rhesus and his horses. Diomed kills Rhesus and twelve of his sleeping men. Ulysses leads Rhesus's horses away. Pallas appears to Diomed, warning him that Apollo is rousing a Trojan to intervene and urges them to return.

Diomed and Ulysses return to the Greek camp with the horses. Nestor is the first to hear and recognize the sound of the approaching horses. The Greeks greet them. Ulysses explains the mission's success and the acquisition of the Thracian horses and Dolon's spoils. They cross the trench, stable the horses, dedicate Dolon's armor to Pallas, and cleanse themselves in the sea before enjoying a well-deserved repast.

**Book XI: The Third Battle, and the Acts of Agamemnon**

With the arrival of the thirtieth day of the poem, Eris (Discord), sent by Jove, descends to the Greek fleet, blazing with the torch of conflict. She sounds a terrifying war cry, rousing all the Greek warriors, who are now eager for revenge. Agamemnon, adorned in magnificent armor (a gift from King Cinyras), leads the Greeks. Juno and Minerva promise aid. Jupiter, foreseeing the day's slaughter, sends drops of bloody rain over the field.

The Trojans, led by Hector, Polydamas, and Æneas, array themselves near Ilus' tomb. Hector inspires his troops. A fierce battle begins, with Greeks and Trojans fighting with equal intensity.

Agamemnon leads a devastating charge. He kills Bienor and his charioteer, Oïleus. He then slays two sons of Priam, Isus and Antiphus, who were once ransomed by Achilles but now fall to Agamemnon. Next, he kills Pisander and Hippolochus, sons of Antimachus, who had previously advocated for Helen's retention and Ulysses' death. Agamemnon's fury drives the Trojans back to the city walls.

Jupiter sends Iris to Hector, instructing him to avoid a direct confrontation with Agamemnon while the king is still on his rampage. Iris tells Hector to hold back his main forces but to wait until Agamemnon is wounded and withdraws from the field. At that point, Jove will empower Hector to drive the Greeks back to their ships until sunset. Hector, though unwilling, obeys.

Agamemnon continues his slaughter, but Coön (Antenor's eldest son) wounds him in the arm as he is stripping the armor from Iphidamas (Coön's brother, whom Agamemnon had just killed). Agamemnon, though wounded, kills Coön. As his wound stiffens and causes immense pain, Agamemnon is forced to mount his chariot and retreat from the battle, exhorting his troops to continue fighting.

As soon as Hector sees Agamemnon depart, he rallies his Trojans and launches a fierce counter-attack, killing many Greeks. Ulysses and Diomed stand firm against him. Diomed kills Thymbræus and Molion, then the two sons of Merops. Ulysses kills Hypirochus and Hippodamus. Diomed kills Agastrophus.

Hector charges Diomed, who throws his spear, grazing Hector's helmet. Hector is momentarily stunned but saved by Apollo and quickly recovers, retreating into the crowd. Diomed boasts that Hector escaped only by divine aid and speed. Paris then shoots Diomed in the foot with an arrow from behind a monument. Paris boasts. Diomed insults Paris as a cowardly archer, and Ulysses helps him remove the arrow. Diomed, wounded, retreats to the ships.

Ulysses is left alone and surrounded by Trojans. He fights heroically, killing several chiefs (Deiopis, Ennomus, Thoon, Chersidamas, Charops). Socus, Charops' brother, wounds Ulysses in the side with a spear, but Pallas prevents a fatal injury. Ulysses kills Socus, then, still wounded and surrounded, cries for help. Menelaus and Ajax hear his call and rush to his rescue. Ajax covers Ulysses with his shield, and Menelaus takes him to a chariot.

Ajax then drives off the Trojans, killing Doryclus, Pandocus, and Lysander.

Meanwhile, on another part of the field, Paris wounds Machaon, the physician, with an arrow in the shoulder. Idomeneus urges Nestor to carry Machaon to the ships in his chariot for healing, stressing the importance of a physician. Nestor complies.

Cebriones, Hector's charioteer, informs Hector that Ajax is causing great slaughter on the left flank. Hector redirects his chariot there. Hector attacks, and Ajax is forced to retreat slowly. Eurypylus, aiding Ajax, kills Apisaon. Paris then wounds Eurypylus in the thigh with an arrow. Eurypylus calls for Greek aid, and they rally to protect him. Patroclus, seeing Nestor carry Machaon past his tent, departs to ask Achilles who the wounded man is. On his way back, he encounters Eurypylus, also wounded, and assists him.

**Book XII: The Battle at the Grecian Wall**

While Patroclus attends to the wounded Eurypylus, the battle continues at the Greek fortifications. The text notes that these walls, built without proper sacrifices to the gods, are destined to be destroyed by Neptune and Apollo after the fall of Troy.

Hector leads the Trojans against the Greek wall. The Trojans hesitate at the deep trench, which is bristling with sharpened stakes. Polydamas advises Hector to dismount from their chariots and attack on foot, dividing the army into five battalions. Hector agrees. Asius, however, disobeys and charges the gates in his chariot, hoping to break through. He is met by Polypoetes and Leonteus, two fierce Lapith warriors, who valiantly defend the gates, repelling Asius and his men. Asius bitterly complains about his failure.

An ominous sign appears to the Trojans: an eagle carrying a large, bleeding serpent. The serpent stings the eagle, which drops its prey among the Trojans. Polydamas interprets this as a warning from Jove to abandon the attack on the ships, predicting future woes even if they breach the walls. Hector angrily rejects this advice, calling it cowardly, asserting that Jove's previous signs of favor are sufficient, and threatening anyone who disobeys him.

The Trojans, inspired by Hector, renew their assault on the wall. Sarpedon, a Lycian prince and son of Jove, stands out, leading his troops with a massive shield. He delivers a stirring speech to Glaucus, urging his Lycians to fight bravely and earn their glory, or die trying.

Menestheus, defending his section of the wall, calls for help from Ajax and Teucer. Thoas, a herald, delivers the message. Ajax Telamon responds, instructing Lycomede and Ajax Oïleus to hold their ground while he and Teucer go to Menestheus' aid.

Ajax, arriving at Menestheus's sector, throws a huge stone, killing Epicles (Sarpedon's friend). Teucer wounds Glaucus with an arrow, but Glaucus conceals his wound and retreats. Sarpedon, enraged by Glaucus's injury, fights more fiercely, killing Alcmaon. Sarpedon then tears down a section of the wall, creating a large breach. Teucer and Ajax attack Sarpedon, but Jove protects his son. Sarpedon rallies his Lycians to exploit the breach.

The battle intensifies at the breach. Neither side can gain a decisive advantage. Finally, Hector, with divine strength granted by Jove, heaves a colossal stone and smashes open one of the Greek gates. He rushes through, two spears in hand, blazing like a god. The Trojans pour through the breach, driving the terrified Greeks back towards their ships.

**Book XIII: The Fourth Battle Continued, in Which Neptune Assists the Greeks: The Acts of Idomeneus**

Jupiter, having secured the Trojan advantage at the wall, turns his attention away from the battle, observing distant lands. Neptune, seeing the Greeks in dire straits and Jupiter's absence, secretly intervenes to aid them. Disguised as Calchas, the prophet, he first inspires the Ajaxes (Ajax Telamon and Ajax Oïleus) with renewed courage. He then encourages other Greek leaders, including Teucer, Leitus, Peneleus, Thoas, Deipyrus, Merion, and Antilochus, who are rallying at the ships.

The Ajaxes, reinvigorated, form a strong phalanx, halting Hector's advance. Deiphobus throws a spear at Merion, but it breaks on Merion's shield. Merion returns to the tent of Idomeneus to retrieve another spear. There, he converses with Idomeneus about the battle, and they agree to return together.

Idomeneus, fierce in battle, kills Othryoneus (a Trojan ally who came to Troy hoping to marry Cassandra in exchange for helping them win the war). Idomeneus then kills Asius, who had charged the gates in his chariot earlier. Antilochus kills Asius' charioteer. Deiphobus, enraged by Asius' death, throws a spear at Idomeneus, misses, and instead kills Hypsenor. Deiphobus boasts over Hypsenor's body. Idomeneus, also enraged, then kills Alcathous (Anchises' son-in-law).

Æneas, angered by the death of Alcathous (his brother-in-law), confronts Idomeneus. Idomeneus calls for the aid of his Greek allies (Antilochus, Deipyrus, Merion, Aphareus). Æneas also summons his Trojan allies (Paris, Deiphobus, Agenor). A fierce battle rages around Alcathous's body. Æneas throws his spear, missing Idomeneus. Idomeneus then kills Oenomaus.

Deiphobus again throws his spear, missing Idomeneus, but hitting Ascalaphus (son of Mars), who dies. Deiphobus tries to strip Ascalaphus's helmet, but Merion wounds Deiphobus in the arm. Polites helps Deiphobus retreat from the field. Æneas kills Aphareus. Antilochus kills Thoon. Adamas attacks Antilochus, but Neptune deflects the spear, and Merion then kills Adamas. Helenus wounds Deipyrus. Menelaus wounds Helenus in the hand and then kills Pisander (Antimachus's son). Menelaus kills Harpalion. Paris kills Euchenor.

Hector remains fixed at the center, where the gates were forced, still fighting the Ajaxes and other Greek contingents. The Locrian archers, not equipped with heavy armor, rain arrows and stones on the Trojans from the rear.

Polydamas again advises Hector to call a council and consolidate forces, warning him of the continuing threat of Achilles. Hector agrees to the counsel. He goes to rally other chiefs, reproaching Paris for his perceived inaction. Paris explains that Deiphobus and Helenus are wounded. Hector then rejoins Polydamas. Hector and Ajax exchange defiant challenges. Jove sends an eagle as a favorable omen for the Greeks.

**Book XIV: Juno Deceives Jupiter by the Girdle of Venus**

Nestor, while resting and attending to the wounded Machaon, hears the intensified clamor of battle. He grows anxious and leaves Machaon to investigate, taking his son Thrasymedes' shield and a spear. He sees the Greek wall in ruins and the army in disarray. He encounters Agamemnon, Ulysses, and Diomed, all of whom are wounded and supporting themselves with spears as they walk from the ships.

Agamemnon, overwhelmed, suggests abandoning the siege and preparing the ships for flight under cover of night. Ulysses fiercely rebukes Agamemnon for his cowardly words, reminding him of Greek bravery and duty. Diomed supports Ulysses, advising that even though wounded, they should return to the front line to encourage their troops, but stay out of direct combat. The leaders agree and proceed to the front.

Neptune, still secretly aiding the Greeks, appears as an old man and encourages Agamemnon, assuring him that Jove will soon abandon the Trojans. He then rushes through the Greek ranks, inspiring courage.

Meanwhile, Juno, from Olympus, observes Jupiter on Mount Ida and his continued favoritism towards the Trojans. She devises a plan to deceive him. She carefully adorns herself, making herself irresistible, and then visits Venus to borrow her magical girdle (cestus), which contains all charms of love, desire, and persuasion. Venus, though initially hesitant, grants the request.

Juno then goes to the realm of Sleep, asking him to lull Jupiter into a deep slumber. Sleep is reluctant, recalling a previous occasion when he put Jove to sleep, allowing Juno to send a storm against Hercules, which resulted in Jove's furious pursuit of Sleep. Juno reassures him that Jupiter's anger won't be as great this time and promises him Pasithaë, one of the Graces, as his wife. Sleep, swearing on the Styx, agrees.

Juno flies to Mount Ida. Jupiter sees her and is instantly captivated by her beauty, overcome by a powerful desire. He embraces her, and with Sleep's aid, falls into a deep slumber. Sleep immediately informs Neptune that Jove is asleep, allowing Neptune to freely aid the Greeks.

Neptune, filled with zeal, rallies the Greeks. Hector, still leading the Trojans, hurls his javelin at Ajax, which glances off his shield. Ajax, in return, lifts a massive stone and strikes Hector in the chest, knocking him down. Polydamas, Æneas, and other Trojan chiefs rush to rescue the unconscious Hector, carrying him from the battle. Hector is borne towards Troy.

With Hector removed from the field, the Greeks gain a decisive advantage. The lesser Ajax (Ajax Oïleus) particularly distinguishes himself, slaughtering many Trojans. The Trojans, now heavily distressed, are forced to give way.

**Book XV: The Fifth Battle at the Ships; and the Acts of Ajax**

The Trojans, in swift flight, cross the trench and gather by their chariots, filled with fear. Jupiter, waking from his slumber on Mount Ida, sees the Trojans routed, Greeks victorious, and Neptune leading the Greek forces. He also spots Hector, severely wounded and near death. Enraged at Juno's deception, he furiously confronts her.

Juno, trembling, denies responsibility, swearing by the Styx and other sacred oaths that Neptune acted on his own. Jupiter, though still suspecting her, outlines his unalterable plan: he will continue to empower the Trojans. He will send Iris and Apollo. Iris will command Neptune to withdraw, and Apollo will revive Hector and lead him back to battle with the aegis. Hector will drive the Greeks to their ships, and Patroclus, in Achilles' armor, will then be sent to save the fleet. Patroclus will kill many, including Jove's own son Sarpedon, but will then be killed by Hector. Only after Patroclus's death will Achilles re-enter the war and kill Hector, after which Troy is destined to fall. Jove reaffirms his promise to Achilles.

Juno swiftly flies to Olympus. She finds the other gods still resentful of Jove's actions. She attempts to stir Mars to rebellion, recounting Ascalaphus's death. Mars, furious, prepares to descend to battle, but Pallas (Minerva) restrains him, reminding him of Jove's power and past punishments.

Juno then sends Iris to Neptune, commanding him to withdraw from the battle, and Apollo to revive Hector. Iris delivers Jove's message to Neptune. Neptune, though angry and asserting his equal birth with Jove, reluctantly obeys and retreats to the sea, but warns that his wrath will endure if Jove breaks his promise regarding Troy's ultimate fate.

Apollo descends to the plain, finds Hector recovering near his chariot, and breathes new strength into him. Hector, invigorated, returns to battle, led by Apollo, who carries the aegis of Jove, striking terror into the Greeks. The Trojans rally. Thoas is dismayed by Hector's return. Hector leads a powerful charge, driving the Greeks from the field.

Apollo aids the Trojans by pushing down sections of the Greek wall and filling the ditch, creating a wide path to the ships. Nestor, seeing the imminent danger, prays to Jove, who responds with thunder, signaling his acceptance of Nestor's plea to save the ships. The Trojans pour onto the Greek camp, attacking the ships directly.

Patroclus, seeing the ships burning, leaves the wounded Eurypylus and rushes to find Achilles.

Hector seizes one of the Greek ships, the one that brought Protesilaus to Troy. He calls for flames to burn the fleet. Ajax fights desperately to defend the ships, killing Clytius. Teucer, aiming at Hector, has his bowstring break (divinely caused), forcing him to switch to a spear. Hector continues to rally his troops, promising death to any who pause to plunder before the ships are burned. Ajax delivers a passionate speech, urging the Greeks to fight with courage, as their survival depends solely on defending the ships. He kills twelve bold Trojans who attempt to set the ships on fire.

**Book XVI: The Sixth Battle, the Acts and Death of Patroclus**

While the battle rages and the Greek ships are under threat, Patroclus, weeping, approaches Achilles. Achilles asks the cause of his grief. Patroclus recounts the severe wounds suffered by many Greek chiefs (Eurypylus, Diomed, Agamemnon, Ulysses, Eurypylus wounded again) and condemns Achilles' unyielding rage. He pleads with Achilles to at least allow him to lead the Myrmidons into battle, clad in Achilles' armor, to scare the Trojans and save the fleet.

Achilles agrees, but gives strict instructions: Patroclus must only repel the Trojans from the ships and extinguish the fires; he must not pursue the Trojans to the walls of Troy or engage Hector directly. Achilles expresses a desperate wish that all Trojans and Greeks would perish, leaving only the two of them to conquer Troy.

At this point, Hector, having broken Ajax's spear, leads the Trojans to set fire to the ships. Protesilaus' ship catches fire. Achilles, seeing the flames, urges Patroclus to arm and enter the fight immediately.

Patroclus dons Achilles' magnificent armor (greaves, cuirass, shield, helmet), but Achilles' great ash spear is too heavy for him. Automedon harnesses Achilles' immortal horses, Xanthus and Balius, and the mortal horse Pedasus. Achilles rallies his Myrmidons, reminding them of their past complaints and urging them to fight fiercely. He then pours a libation to Jove, praying for Patroclus's success in saving the ships and a safe return. Jove grants the first part of the prayer but denies the safe return.

Patroclus leads the Myrmidons into battle. The Trojans, seeing Achilles' armor, are struck with terror, believing Achilles himself has returned, and flee from the ships. Patroclus extinguishes the fires and drives the Trojans from the Greek camp.

Patroclus kills many Trojans, including Pyrechmes, Areilycus, Thoas, Amphidus, Atymnius, and Maris (Sarpedon's friends), Cleobulus, Lycon, Neamas, and Erymas. He relentlessly pursues the fleeing Trojans, driving them back towards the walls of Troy, ignoring Achilles' command.

Sarpedon, a Lycian ally and son of Jove, reproaches his fleeing troops and challenges Patroclus. Jove debates whether to save his son from fate, but Juno persuades him to let Sarpedon die to maintain divine impartiality. Jove sheds tears of blood. Patroclus kills Thrasymed. Sarpedon throws two spears; one misses, the other kills Pedasus (Achilles' mortal horse). Automedon cuts the traces to free the immortal horses. Sarpedon throws another spear, which misses Patroclus. Patroclus then throws his spear, piercing Sarpedon's heart and killing him.

Sarpedon, with his dying breath, implores Glaucus to rally the Lycians and prevent the Greeks from stripping his body. Glaucus, still wounded from Teucer's arrow, prays to Apollo for strength. Apollo heals Glaucus and inspires him. Glaucus rallies the Lycians and Hector to defend Sarpedon's body. Patroclus rallies the Greeks and Ajax to strip Sarpedon's armor. A fierce battle rages around Sarpedon's corpse, with Jove casting a veil of darkness over the fight.

Epigeus is killed by Hector. Patroclus kills Sthenelaus and Bathyclaeus. Merion kills Laogonus. Æneas throws a spear at Merion, who dodges it. Patroclus rebukes Merion for conversing during battle.

Eventually, the Greeks gain control of Sarpedon's body, and Patroclus strips the radiant armor. Jove commands Apollo to rescue Sarpedon's body, cleanse it, anoint it with ambrosia, dress it in celestial robes, and have Sleep and Death carry it to Lycia for burial. Apollo obeys.

Patroclus, still disregarding Achilles' command, pursues the Trojans to the walls of Troy. He attempts to scale the battlements three times, but Apollo repulses him each time, stating that Troy is not destined to fall by his hand, nor even by Achilles' yet. Hector, at the Scaean gates, debates his next move. Apollo, disguised as Asius, urges Hector to confront Patroclus.

Hector returns to battle. Patroclus kills Cebriones (Hector's charioteer) with a stone. Hector and Patroclus fight fiercely over Cebriones' body. Finally, Apollo intervenes again, striking Patroclus from behind, disorienting and disarming him. Euphorbus then wounds Patroclus with a spear. Hector delivers the fatal blow, piercing Patroclus with his lance.

Hector boasts over the dying Patroclus, who with his last breath prophesies Hector's imminent death by Achilles' hand. Patroclus dies, and his soul flies to the underworld. Hector pulls his spear from Patroclus's body and pursues Automedon, who escapes with Achilles' immortal horses.

**Book XVII: The Seventh Battle, for the Body of Patroclus.—The Acts of Menelaus**

Patroclus lies dead on the battlefield. Menelaus, filled with grief and rage, immediately steps forward to guard the body. Euphorbus, who had first wounded Patroclus, challenges Menelaus for the spoils, boasting of his deed. Menelaus retorts, recalling his previous slaying of Euphorbus's brother, Hyperenor, and then kills Euphorbus with a spear thrust to the throat. Menelaus attempts to strip Euphorbus's armor.

Apollo, disguised as Mentes (a Ciconian leader), urges Hector to retrieve Patroclus's body and Achilles' armor. Hector, seeing Euphorbus dead, rushes to the scene. Menelaus, recognizing Hector's divine support, wisely retreats, but calls for Ajax. Ajax Telamon arrives, and Hector, who had momentarily seized Patroclus's head, withdraws as Ajax approaches. Hector's men carry Patroclus's armor (Achilles' former armor) towards Troy.

Ajax then stands guard over Patroclus's naked body. Menelaus joins him. Glaucus, the Lycian, reproaches Hector for retreating and allowing Sarpedon's body to be stripped earlier, while now failing to secure Patroclus's body (and Achilles' armor). He urges Hector to fight for Patroclus's body, to exchange for Sarpedon's.

Hector, angered by the rebuke, denies cowardice and declares he will now wear Achilles' armor (which his men are carrying to Troy) and return to the fight. Jove, seeing Hector don the divine armor, pities him, knowing his own death is now closer. Hector, filled with a new, temporary divine strength, rallies the Trojans.

Ajax and Menelaus rally the Greeks, urging them to fight fiercely to defend Patroclus's body. A ferocious battle erupts around the corpse, shrouded in a divine darkness by Jove to honor the fallen hero.

Hippothous, dragging Patroclus by the ankle, is killed by Ajax. Ajax also kills Schedius and Phorcys. Apollo, disguised as Periphas, encourages Æneas. Æneas then rallies the Trojans. Æneas kills Leocritus. Lycomede kills Apisaon. The battle rages intensely. Jove keeps the darkness around Patroclus's body, while the rest of the field is illuminated by the sun.

Achilles' immortal horses, Xanthus and Balius, stand weeping for Patroclus's death. Automedon, their charioteer, struggles to control them. Jove pities the horses and breathes new spirit into them, ensuring Automedon's safety. Automedon hands the reins to Alcimedon and prepares to fight. Hector and Æneas target Achilles' chariot. Automedon calls for Ajax and Menelaus. Automedon kills Aretus. Ajax and Menelaus arrive, driving Hector and Æneas back.

Minerva, disguised as Phoenix, encourages Menelaus, filling him with courage. Menelaus kills Podes (a friend of Hector). Jove again turns the tide, terrifying the Greeks. Peneleus and Leitus are wounded. Idomeneus's spear misses Hector but kills Coeranus (Merion's charioteer). Idomeneus and Merion are forced to retreat to the ships.

Ajax, recognizing Jove's hand in the changing fortune of battle, prays to Jupiter to dispel the darkness so they can see to fight or die. Jove grants his prayer, restoring light. Menelaus sends Antilochus to carry the sorrowful news of Patroclus's death to Achilles. Antilochus, heartbroken, runs to the ships. Menelaus returns to the fight.

Menelaus and Merion, assisted by the Ajaxes, heroically bear Patroclus's body towards the ships, constantly battling the pursuing Trojans, led fiercely by Hector and Æneas. The fight is arduous, with many falling on both sides, but the Greeks slowly make their way towards the fleet. Jove continues to impress terror on the Greeks, and arms and armor are strewn across the field.

**Book XVIII: The Grief of Achilles, and New Armour Made Him by Vulcan**

The fierce battle rages around Patroclus's body. Nestor's son, Antilochus, reaches Achilles' ships, where Achilles sits, foreboding his fate. Antilochus delivers the tragic news: Patroclus is dead, and Hector has stripped him of Achilles' armor.

Achilles is overcome with profound grief. He casts dust and ashes over his head, tears his hair, and rolls on the ground, groaning loudly. His captive women, including Briseïs, rush from their tents, beating their breasts and fainting in shared sorrow. Antilochus clings to Achilles, preventing him from harming himself in his frenzy.

From the depths of the ocean, Thetis hears her son's cries. She ascends with her Nereid sisters to comfort him. Achilles expresses his inconsolable grief, regretting that he lived to see Patroclus die. He declares that he no longer wishes to live unless he can avenge Patroclus by killing Hector, accepting his own prophesied death immediately afterward.

Thetis warns him that his death will closely follow Hector's. Achilles acknowledges this but remains resolute. Thetis then agrees to procure new, divine armor from Vulcan, as Hector now possesses Achilles' old set. She departs for Olympus, and the Nereids return to the sea.

Meanwhile, the Greeks are still struggling to retrieve Patroclus's body from the furious Trojan assault. Hector is like a flame, overwhelming the Greek rear. Juno, seeing the Greeks pressed hard, sends Iris to Achilles. Iris urges Achilles to appear at the trench, even unarmed, to turn the tide of battle and save Patroclus's body from desecration.

Achilles, without armor, rises. Pallas (Minerva) casts her aegis over his shoulders and ignites a golden cloud above his head, making him blaze with divine light. He stands at the trench and shouts three times. The Trojans are seized with panic; their horses recoil, and many are crushed by chariots or impaled on their own spears. The Greeks seize the opportunity to carry Patroclus's body back to the ships.

Achilles continues to mourn over Patroclus's body, remembering his friend and vowing to sacrifice twelve Trojan captives on his pyre, and to deliver Hector's body to the dogs.

The sun sets, ending the day's fighting. The Trojans hold a council. Polydamas advises retreat into the city walls, fearing Achilles' return. Hector rejects this, urging the Trojans to remain on the plain and attack the ships at dawn, confident that Jove will grant them victory and that he can face Achilles himself. The Trojans, swayed by Pallas, applaud Hector's reckless advice.

Achilles laments over Patroclus throughout the night, vowing to delay his funeral until Hector's head is brought to him and the twelve Trojans are sacrificed. His Myrmidons cleanse Patroclus's body.

Thetis arrives at Vulcan's palace on Olympus. Vulcan, remembering how Thetis rescued him as a child, eagerly offers his aid. Thetis describes Achilles' grief and the loss of his armor and friend, requesting new, divine armor. Vulcan promises to forge the most magnificent armor ever seen.

Vulcan then begins his work at the forge. He first creates a vast, multi-layered shield, depicting the cosmos (earth, heaven, sea, sun, moon, stars), two cities (one in peace, with feasts, weddings, and legal disputes; one in war, besieged and ambushed), a ploughed field, a harvest scene, a vineyard, a herd of oxen attacked by lions, a sheepfold, and a dancing-ground. The shield is rimmed with the ocean. He also forges a glittering cuirass, greaves, and a helmet. Thetis takes the blazing new armor and flies swiftly back to Achilles.

**Book XIX: The Reconciliation of Achilles and Agamemnon**

At dawn, Thetis arrives at Achilles' tent, finding him still mourning over Patroclus. She presents him with the magnificent new armor forged by Vulcan. Achilles is deeply moved by its divine craftsmanship. He expresses concern that Patroclus's body will decay, but Thetis assures him that she has preserved it with nectar and ambrosia, keeping it fresh and free from corruption. She commands him to renounce his wrath and return to battle.

Achilles calls the Greeks to assembly. The heroes, including the still-wounded Diomed, Ulysses, and Agamemnon, gather. Achilles stands and publicly declares that his quarrel with Agamemnon is over, wishing that Briseïs had died before causing such grief and loss to the Greeks. He announces his readiness to fight immediately.

Agamemnon, without rising from his throne, acknowledges his error, attributing his ""madness"" to Jove and Ate (the goddess of mischief), recounting a myth where even Jove was once deceived by Ate. He reiterates his offer of gifts, including Briseïs, and solemnly swears before all the Greeks and the gods that he has never touched Briseïs.

Achilles, impatient for battle, declares he cares nothing for gifts, only for war and revenge. Ulysses intervenes, emphasizing the necessity for the army to eat and rest to gain strength before battle. He insists that Agamemnon must publicly deliver the gifts and swear the oath, as a matter of honor and to appease Achilles fully.

Agamemnon agrees. Ulysses, with the help of Nestor's sons and other chiefs, brings the offered treasures and the seven captive women, including Briseïs, to Achilles' tent. Agamemnon then performs the solemn oath over a sacrificial boar, swearing that Briseïs is untouched. The boar is then cast into the sea.

Achilles acknowledges Jove's will in their past strife, but still refuses to eat, consumed by grief and thirst for vengeance. He vows not to partake of food until he has avenged Patroclus and tasted Hector's blood.

Jove, seeing Achilles' unwavering grief and refusal to eat, sends Minerva to infuse ambrosia and nectar into Achilles' breast, sustaining him.

The Greek army then prepares for battle. Achilles dons his new, blazing, divine armor, which flashes like fire. His eyes glow with fury. He grinds his teeth, eager for the fight. Automedon and Alcimus harness his immortal horses. Achilles mounts his chariot and addresses his horses, Xanthus and Balius, reproaching them for leaving Patroclus to die. Xanthus miraculously speaks, prophesying Achilles' own imminent death, not by their fault, but by the will of a god and a mortal hand. The Furies silence the horse. Achilles, undeterred, accepts his fate and rushes into battle.

**Book XX: The Battle of the Gods, and the Acts of Achilles**

With Achilles returned to battle, Jupiter convenes a council of the gods on Olympus. He grants permission for all deities to openly assist either the Greeks or the Trojans, fearing that Achilles, unhindered, would quickly destroy Troy against fate. The gods divide, descending to the battlefield: Juno, Neptune, Minerva, Hermes, and Vulcan support the Greeks; Latona, Apollo, Mars, Diana, and Xanthus (the river god Scamander) support the Trojans.

The earth trembles as gods and mortals clash. Jove thunders from Olympus, and Neptune shakes the ground. Pluto, in the underworld, fears his dark realms will be exposed to light.

Achilles, raging, seeks only Hector. Apollo, disguised as Lycaon, encourages Æneas to confront Achilles. Æneas recounts his previous defeat by Achilles and Minerva but is emboldened by Apollo to stand his ground. Achilles and Æneas meet. Achilles taunts Æneas, reminding him of their past encounter on Mount Ida and his flight from Lyrnessus. Æneas, in turn, recounts his own divine lineage from Jove and asserts his right to fight.

Æneas throws his spear, which strikes Achilles' divine shield but is repelled by its layered construction. Achilles throws his spear, which pierces Æneas's shield, forcing Æneas to duck. Achilles draws his sword to finish him, but Neptune intervenes, covering Achilles in a mist, extracting his spear from Æneas's shield, and carrying Æneas away to the edge of the battle, warning him to avoid Achilles until Achilles' prophesied death.

Achilles, finding his spear returned and Æneas gone, realizes a god intervened. He then exhorts the Greeks and plunges into the Trojan ranks, slaughtering many. He kills Iphytion, Demoleon, Hippodamas, Laogonus, Dardanus, Alastor, Mulius, Echeclus, Deucalion, Rhigmas, and Rhigmas's charioteer.

Hector witnesses the death of his youngest brother, Polydore, by Achilles' hand. Overcome with grief and rage, Hector rushes to confront Achilles. Achilles is overjoyed to finally face Hector. They exchange defiant words. Hector throws his spear, but Minerva deflects it from Achilles. Minerva then retrieves Achilles' spear and returns it to him, unseen by Hector. Hector, thinking he had missed and having no other spear, draws his sword. Achilles charges, but Apollo shrouds Hector in a cloud, saving him from Achilles' three furious thrusts. Achilles, frustrated, curses Hector's escape and vows further slaughter.

Achilles continues his rampage, killing more Trojans. Priam, witnessing the devastation from the city walls, orders the gates opened to allow the fleeing Trojans to enter. Apollo helps cover their retreat. Achilles pursues them fiercely towards the city.

Apollo, to draw Achilles away from the city gates, takes the form of Agenor and confronts Achilles. Agenor stands his ground and throws his spear at Achilles, which is deflected by Achilles' divine armor. Apollo then carries Agenor away in a cloud and, still disguised as Agenor, leads Achilles on a chase away from the city, allowing the remaining Trojan troops to escape safely within the walls.

**Book XXI: The Battle in the River Scamander**

Achilles drives the fleeing Trojans towards the Xanthus (Scamander) river. Some flee to the city, but others plunge into the river. Achilles casts aside his spear and, armed only with his sword, wades into the river, slaughtering Trojans indiscriminately. He takes twelve young Trojans alive as captives, intending to sacrifice them to Patroclus's shade.

He then encounters Lycaon, a son of Priam whom Achilles had previously captured and sold into slavery on Lemnos, but who had been ransomed. Lycaon, trembling, begs for his life, pleading for mercy and offering a large ransom, emphasizing that he is not from the same mother as Hector. Achilles, hardened by Patroclus's death, refuses any mercy. He kills Lycaon and casts his body into the river, mocking him and all of Troy, saying that their offerings to the river god are in vain.

Achilles then confronts Asteropeus, a Paeonian leader whose lineage traces back to the river Axius. Asteropeus, fearless, throws two spears, one striking Achilles' divine shield and the other grazing his arm, drawing blood. Achilles throws his spear, which misses Asteropeus but embeds itself deep in the riverbank. Achilles then draws his sword and kills Asteropeus, boasting about his own divine lineage (from Jove) being superior to Asteropeus's river-god ancestry. He casts Asteropeus's body into the river.

The river Scamander, choked with bodies and enraged by the slaughter, speaks to Achilles in human form, demanding he cease polluting his waters. Achilles agrees to stop killing in the river but declares he will not stop fighting until Troy is sacked and Hector is dead.

Scamander, infuriated, swells his waves and attacks Achilles, disgorging bodies and rocks. Achilles is swept away but saves himself by grabbing an elm tree, which falls, bridging the river. Scamander, still raging, pursues Achilles, aiming to drown him. Achilles, facing imminent death by drowning, cries out to Jove, lamenting that his fate might be an ignominious death like a common swain caught in a flood, rather than a heroic death in battle.

Neptune and Pallas appear to Achilles in human form, reassuring him that he will not drown and instructing him to continue fighting until the Trojans are driven into their city and Hector is slain.

Achilles, reinvigorated, returns to the fight. Scamander again swells, calling to his brother-river Simois for aid. Simois joins Scamander in a combined assault, unleashing a torrent of waves, rocks, and bodies upon Achilles. Juno, witnessing this, fears for Achilles and calls to Vulcan for aid.

Vulcan unleashes a devastating fire, consuming the dead bodies, drying the riverbanks, burning the trees along the shore, and boiling the river's waters. Scamander, in agony, begs Vulcan to cease and promises to desist from aiding Troy. Juno orders Vulcan to stop the fire. The flames subside, and the rivers return to their normal courses.

With the river god pacified, the other gods engage in their own battles. Mars attacks Minerva, striking her shield. Minerva retaliates with a huge stone, knocking Mars unconscious and then striking Venus, who comes to Mars' aid. Minerva mocks both goddesses. Neptune challenges Apollo, but Apollo refuses to fight mortals or other gods over such a trivial cause. Diana then upbraids Apollo for his refusal, and Juno furiously attacks Diana, seizing her bow and arrows and beating her, sending her fleeing to Jove. Hermes refuses to fight Latona. Jove smiles at Diana's complaint and asks who caused her woe, and she names Juno.

The gods then return to Olympus. Apollo enters Troy to protect its walls. Achilles continues his slaughter of Trojans outside the city. Priam, on the city walls, sees the widespread carnage and orders the city gates opened to allow the fleeing Trojans to escape inside. Apollo helps cover their retreat. Achilles pursues them relentlessly. Apollo, to allow the remaining Trojans to gain safety, takes the form of Agenor and confronts Achilles. Agenor throws his spear at Achilles, which is deflected. Apollo then leads Achilles on a chase away from the city gates, enabling the last of the Trojans to safely enter Troy.

**Book XXII: The Death of Hector**

All the Trojans have now retreated safely within the city walls, except for Hector, who remains outside the Scaean gate, resolved to face Achilles alone. Apollo, who had been diverting Achilles, reveals his godhead to Achilles and reproaches him for pursuing a god. Achilles, angered, accuses Apollo of cheating him of glory.

Achilles then rushes towards the city. From the walls, King Priam and Queen Hecuba see him approaching, blazing like a deadly star. They desperately plead with Hector to come inside, warning him of Achilles' ferocity and foreseeing Troy's doom if he falls. Priam laments the loss of his many sons and fears his own gruesome fate. Hecuba bares her breast, begging Hector to remember her motherhood.

Hector remains steadfast, debating within himself whether to retreat (recalling Polydamas's rejected counsel, which he now regrets) or to face Achilles. He decides against parleying, knowing Achilles' implacable nature. As Achilles draws near, Hector's resolve breaks, and he flees in terror.

Achilles pursues Hector three times around the walls of Troy. The gods observe this chase. Jupiter pities Hector, who has offered him so many sacrifices, and debates whether to save him. Minerva argues that Hector is fated to die. Jupiter gives his consent, and Minerva descends.

Apollo, who had been giving Hector strength, now abandons him. Minerva, disguised as Hector's brother Deiphobus, appears beside Hector, encouraging him and promising to fight with him. Hector, believing he has an ally, turns to face Achilles. He proposes an oath that the victor will return the loser's body for proper burial. Achilles, filled with fury, rejects any pact, comparing it to a league between wolves and lambs, and declares unending hatred. He reveals that Pallas (Minerva) has delivered Hector to him.

Achilles throws his spear, but Hector dodges it. Minerva retrieves Achilles' spear and returns it to him, unseen by Hector. Hector, thinking he had missed and his own spear was lost, calls for Deiphobus, only to realize he is alone and has been deceived by a god. Accepting his fate, Hector resolves to die gloriously.

Hector draws his sword and charges Achilles. Achilles charges in return, his spear blazing. He spots a vulnerable point in Patroclus's old armor (now worn by Hector) at the juncture of the neck and throat. Achilles thrusts his spear through this spot, fatally wounding Hector, but not cutting his windpipe, so Hector can still speak.

Achilles boasts over the dying Hector, refusing his plea for burial and vowing his body will be devoured by dogs and birds. Hector, with his last breath, prophesies Achilles' own death by Paris and Apollo at the Scaean gate. Hector dies, and his soul departs to the underworld.

Achilles strips Hector's armor, and other Greeks gather to stab the body. Achilles then, in a final act of vengeance, pierces Hector's ankles, threads leather thongs through them, and ties the body to his chariot. He mounts his car and drags Hector's body three times around Patroclus's tomb, then towards the ships.

From the walls of Troy, Priam and Hecuba witness the horrific spectacle of their beloved son's body being desecrated. They both lament wildly, attempting to rush to the gate but are restrained by the people. Andromache, unaware in the inner palace, hears the commotion, rushes to the walls, and sees her husband's body being dragged. She faints from shock and grief. When she revives, she laments Hector's death, foreseeing the destruction of Troy and the enslavement or death of their infant son, Astyanax. She vows to burn the garments she wove for Hector, as they are now useless to him.

**Book XXIII: Funeral Games in Honour of Patroclus**

The Greeks mourn Hector's death. Achilles assembles his Myrmidons, commanding them to drive their chariots three times around Patroclus's body as a final honor. They do so, weeping, with Achilles leading them. Achilles then lays his hands on Patroclus's body and declares that Hector's corpse will be left for dogs and that twelve Trojan captives will be sacrificed on the pyre. He throws Hector's body to the ground. The Myrmidons feast.

Agamemnon and other chiefs try to persuade Achilles to eat, but he refuses, vowing not to eat or wash until Patroclus is buried. He instructs Agamemnon to prepare a large funeral pyre for Patroclus at dawn. The Greeks feast and sleep.

Achilles, unable to sleep, lies on the seashore, still consumed by grief. The ghost of Patroclus appears to him, urging him to bury his body so his soul can cross into the underworld. Patroclus asks Achilles to bury their bones together in the same golden urn. Achilles attempts to embrace the ghost, but it vanishes like smoke. Achilles, amazed, realizes the dead retain an ethereal form.

At dawn, Agamemnon sends a chosen band with mules and wagons, led by Merion, to Mount Ida to fell timber for the pyre. They return with a large quantity of wood. The Greeks then form a funeral procession: chariots, then foot soldiers, then Patroclus's body on a bier, with Achilles supporting his head.

They build the pyre. Achilles cuts a lock of his hair, vowed to the river Sperchius, and places it on Patroclus's hand, lamenting that he will not return home. He then sacrifices many sheep, oxen, four horses, and two dogs, placing their bodies on the pyre. Finally, Achilles sacrifices twelve Trojan captives, throwing them onto the flames, and boasts to Patroclus's shade about his vengeance.

The pyre does not burn. Achilles prays to the Winds, offering libations. Iris, sent by Achilles' prayer, goes to the Winds, who are feasting with the Ethiopians. She delivers Achilles' request. The Winds descend with a roar, fanning the flames, which burn all night. Achilles stays by the pyre, mourning. At dawn, the flames subside.

Achilles then gathers Patroclus's bones, wrapped in fat, and places them in a golden urn, which is then covered with linen. They raise a large mound of earth as a tomb.

Achilles then announces the funeral games with various prizes.
1.  **Chariot Race:** Prizes include a skilled woman and a large vase. Eumelus, Diomed, Menelaus, Antilochus, and Merion compete. Nestor advises his son, Antilochus. Apollo makes Diomed drop his whip, but Pallas returns it and then breaks Eumelus's chariot, causing him to crash. Diomed wins first prize. Antilochus, by pushing Menelaus aside on a narrow track, takes second place. Menelaus, though initially angry, accepts Antilochus's apology and lets him keep the prize. Achilles awards Eumelus a consolation prize. Nestor receives an honorary goblet.
2.  **Boxing (Caestus):** Prizes are a mule and a goblet. Epeüs challenges and confidently defeats Euryalus with a single blow. Euryalus is carried off, receiving the goblet.
3.  **Wrestling:** Prizes are a tripod and a female captive. Ajax Telamon and Ulysses compete. After a long, even struggle, Achilles declares them both winners and divides the prizes.
4.  **Foot Race:** Prizes are a silver urn, an ox, and a half-talent of gold. Ajax Oïleus, Ulysses, and Antilochus compete. Pallas makes Ajax slip in dung, allowing Ulysses to win. Ajax complains that a goddess intervened. Ulysses wins the urn, Ajax the ox, and Antilochus the half-talent.
5.  **Single Combat (Spear Fight):** Prizes are Sarpedon's armor and a Thracian sword. Diomed and Ajax Telamon are the champions. They exchange spear thrusts, but the Greeks stop the fight, declaring both worthy. Diomed receives the sword.
6.  **Discus Throw:** Prize is a mass of raw iron. Polypoetes wins, throwing the discus farthest.
7.  **Archery:** Prizes are double-edged axes for hitting a dove and single axes for cutting the cord holding it. Teucer shoots first, cutting the cord, and the dove flies free. Merion shoots next, killing the dove. Merion wins the double axes.
8.  **Javelin Throw:** Prizes are a silver charger and a spear. Agamemnon and Merion are to compete. Achilles immediately awards first prize to Agamemnon, recognizing his supreme authority and skill, and gives Merion the spear.

The games conclude, and the Greeks disperse.

**Book XXIV: The Redemption of the Body of Hector**

After the funeral games, the Greeks retire to their ships to feast and sleep. Achilles, however, remains consumed by grief for Patroclus. He cannot sleep, and each morning he harnesses his chariot and drags Hector's body three times around Patroclus's tomb before returning it to his tent. Apollo protects Hector's body from mutilation and decay.

The gods, observing Achilles' cruel treatment of Hector's corpse, are moved to pity. Apollo complains to the assembly of gods, criticizing Achilles' savage behavior and contrasting it with Hector's piety. Juno, still implacable towards Troy, argues that Achilles, being of divine birth, is superior to Hector, a mere mortal.

Jupiter intervenes, stating that Hector was dear to him due to his many sacrifices. He forbids the gods from secretly stealing the body, as Thetis is guarding Achilles. Instead, he sends Thetis to Achilles to command him to release Hector's body for ransom, warning him of Jove's wrath if he refuses.

Thetis finds Achilles mourning in his tent. She delivers Jove's message. Achilles, though still filled with grief, agrees to obey the will of heaven.

Jupiter then sends Iris to Priam, instructing him to go alone to Achilles' tent with rich gifts to ransom Hector's body. He promises divine protection for Priam's journey. Iris delivers the message to Priam, who is with his lamenting sons in the palace.

Priam immediately prepares the gifts: twelve costly carpets, twelve vests, twelve mantles, twelve veils, garments stiff with gold, two tripods, two chargers, ten talents of gold, and a large, well-wrought bowl. Hecuba tries to dissuade him, fearing Achilles will kill him, but Priam insists, citing Jove's command and an omen. Priam angrily rebukes his remaining sons for their perceived cowardice compared to Hector.

Priam's sons help prepare a new chariot with mules for the gifts. Priam himself harnesses his horses. Hecuba offers a libation to Jove and asks for a favorable omen. Jove sends an eagle flying to the right, confirming the journey.

Priam and his herald Idæus set out. Jupiter sees them and sends Hermes to guide and protect them. Hermes, disguised as a young Myrmidon, meets Priam and Idæus at a spring. He reassures Priam, offers his guidance, and reveals he is a servant of Achilles. Priam questions Hermes about Hector, and Hermes assures him that Hector's body remains untouched and preserved by the gods.

Hermes, refusing a gift from Priam, leads them past the Greek guards (putting them to sleep with his wand) and the trench, directly to Achilles' tent. Hermes opens the massive gate, reveals his true identity and mission, and then vanishes.

Priam enters Achilles' tent, finds Achilles at supper, and prostrates himself at Achilles' feet, embracing his knees and kissing the hands that killed his son. Priam appeals to Achilles' pity by reminding him of his own aged father, Peleus, and the profound grief of losing a son.

Achilles is deeply moved. He weeps, thinking of his own father and the deceased Patroclus. He raises Priam and offers words of comfort, speaking of human suffering as Jove's decree, and recounting the fates of Peleus and Niobe as examples of grief. He urges Priam to cease his unavailing sorrow and eat.

Priam, still focused on Hector, requests the body. Achilles, with a flash of anger, warns Priam not to provoke him further, reiterating that Jove commanded the release. He then orders his servants to prepare Hector's body, washing and anointing it away from Priam's sight to prevent a new outburst of grief and rage. They dress the body and place it on a car. Achilles bids farewell to Patroclus's shade, explaining he is fulfilling Jove's will.

Achilles then invites Priam to eat. They share a meal, observing each other. Priam asks for sleep. Achilles prepares a bed for Priam outside his inner tent and asks how many days he needs for Hector's funeral. Priam requests twelve days for mourning, funeral rites, and building a tomb. Achilles grants a twelve-day truce.

Priam and Idæus sleep in the porch. Hermes returns in the night, waking Priam and warning him that he is still in danger from other Greeks if discovered. Priam and Idæus swiftly depart with Hector's body, guided by Hermes until they reach the Xanthus river.

At dawn, Cassandra sees the funeral procession approaching Troy from the city walls and alerts the city. The Trojans rush out in massive crowds to meet the wain. Hecuba and Andromache lead the lamentation, but Priam commands them to allow the car to proceed to the palace.

Hector's body is brought into the palace and laid on a bed of state. A mournful choir sings. Andromache first laments over Hector, foreseeing the destruction of Troy and the grim fate of their son Astyanax, who will become an orphan and slave, perhaps even killed in revenge. She vows to burn the fine garments she wove for Hector. Hecuba then mourns, praising Hector as the most beloved by gods. Helen also laments Hector, recalling his kindness to her over twenty years and expressing her profound sorrow at losing her only friend in Troy.

Priam commands the Trojans to gather wood for the pyre. For nine days, they gather timber from Mount Ida. On the tenth day, Hector's body is placed on the pyre and burned. On the eleventh day, they collect his bones, place them in a golden vase, wrap it in purple cloth, and bury it under a mound, raising a tomb. Guards watch the rites. After a final funeral feast, the Trojans return to their homes, and the shade of the mighty Hector sleeps peacefully."
The Scarlet Letter-Nathaniel Hawthorne,"The provided text, titled ""The Scarlet Letter,"" begins with a detailed autobiographical introduction called ""The Custom-House,"" recounting the narrator's experiences and discoveries that lead to the writing of the main story.

**The Custom-House Introduction**

The narrator describes his tenure as Surveyor at the Custom-House in Salem, his native town, which is now a dilapidated port. He reflects on his family's long history in Salem, tracing back to a stern Puritan ancestor who was a prominent but persecuting figure. The narrator expresses shame for his ancestors' cruelties, particularly their role in persecuting Quakers and witches. He contrasts his own literary aspirations with the practical, unlaudable pursuits of his forefathers.

He describes his Custom-House colleagues as mostly aged, inefficient, retired sea-captains, who often sleep on duty and tell old sea-stories. He notes the Collector, General Miller, an elderly but distinguished soldier, and a particularly talented, honest, and efficient businessman who manages the Custom-House operations. The narrator admits that his own literary faculties have become dormant during this period, finding the environment uninspiring.

A significant event occurs in the narrator's third year as Surveyor: General Taylor's election to the Presidency leads to a political shift. As a Democrat, the narrator anticipates his imminent removal from office, viewing it with a mix of dread and relief, as it would free him from his unfulfilling public role.

One idle, rainy day, while exploring an unfinished second-story room in the Custom-House, the narrator discovers a small, carefully wrapped package. Inside, he finds an old commission for a former Surveyor named Jonathan Pue and a faded piece of fine red cloth, elaborately embroidered with the capital letter ""A."" Upon touching it to his breast, he experiences a vivid sensation of burning heat and drops it. He then finds a roll of dingy paper twisted around the letter, which contains Jonathan Pue's manuscript. This manuscript provides a ""reasonably complete explanation of the whole affair"" concerning a woman named Hester Prynne, based on oral testimonies.

Inspired by this discovery, the narrator feels his literary imagination reawaken. He recounts a ""ghostly"" encounter with the spirit of Mr. Surveyor Pue, who encourages him to publish his ""mouldy and moth-eaten lucubrations"" and give him proper credit, also forewarning the narrator of his impending dismissal from office.

Shortly after, the narrator is indeed removed from his post, which he welcomes as a return to his true calling as a writer. He resolves to use Pue's manuscript as the authenticated outline for his story, ""THE SCARLET LETTER,"" allowing himself creative license for the details. He concludes his introduction by reflecting on the Custom-House experience as a dream, and states his intention to seek a new home for his children, away from Salem, as he believes his ""native town"" lacks the ""genial atmosphere which a literary man requires.""

**The Scarlet Letter: Main Plot**

**I. The Prison-Door & II. The Market-Place**
The story opens in Boston, ""two centuries ago,"" where a throng of stern-faced Puritan men and women gather outside a gloomy wooden prison. They are awaiting a public spectacle of punishment. The women in the crowd, in particular, express harsh judgment towards the ""malefactress"" Hester Prynne, debating whether her punishment is sufficient. Some suggest branding her forehead or even execution.
The town-beadle leads Hester Prynne from the prison. She carries a three-month-old infant in her arms. On the breast of her elaborate gown, she wears a scarlet letter ""A,"" ""fantastically embroidered and illuminated with gold-thread."" Despite her public shame, Hester carries herself with remarkable dignity and beauty, which astonishes the onlookers. She is led to a scaffold in the market-place, where she is compelled to stand for three hours as a public example of sin.
During her ordeal, Hester experiences intense inner agony, though she maintains a serene outward composure. Her mind races through memories of her past: her childhood home in England, her parents, and then the ""pale, thin, scholar-like visage"" of a slightly deformed man whom she had married in a Continental city. She then returns to the present reality, clutching her child and touching the scarlet letter on her breast.

**III. The Recognition**
While on the scaffold, Hester notices a white man accompanied by an Indian on the edge of the crowd. She recognizes the man, whose face, though intelligent, shows a ""slight deformity"" (one shoulder higher than the other), mirroring a figure from her past memories. The man's features contort with ""writhing horror"" upon seeing her, which he quickly controls, then silently gestures for secrecy by placing a finger on his lips.
This stranger asks a townsman about Hester Prynne's identity and crime. The townsman explains that Hester is the wife of a learned English scholar who had sent her to Boston two years prior but has since disappeared, presumably lost at sea. He states that Hester, left to her own ""misguidance,"" has committed a sin and given birth to a child, but refuses to name the father. The townsman adds that the magistrates, in their ""mercy,"" sentenced her to stand on the pillory for three hours and wear the scarlet letter for life, rather than death.
The stranger identifies himself as Roger Chillingworth, recently freed from Indian captivity, and grimly observes, ""He will be known!"" He then whispers to his Indian companion and they move away.
Hester is then publicly exhorted by Reverend John Wilson, the eldest clergyman, to reveal the father's name. Governor Bellingham reinforces this, appealing to the young Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale, Hester's pastor, to persuade her to confess. Dimmesdale, pale and visibly agitated, urges Hester to speak for the sake of her soul and the father's, warning against hypocrisy. Hester, however, firmly refuses, stating the letter is ""too deeply branded"" and her child ""must seek a heavenly Father; she shall never know an earthly one!"" Dimmesdale, with a deep sigh, acknowledges her ""Wondrous strength and generosity."" Mr. Wilson then delivers a long sermon on sin. Hester and her wailing infant are led back to prison.

**IV. The Interview**
In prison, Hester is in a state of extreme agitation. The jailer brings in a physician, Roger Chillingworth, who is skilled in both European and Indian medicine. Chillingworth calms the infant with a draught, then offers Hester a similar potion to ease her distress. Hester, suspecting poison, hesitates, but Chillingworth assures her it's for good and warns that his revenge would be to let her live with her shame, not to kill her. He touches the scarlet letter on her breast, which feels like ""red-hot"" iron.
Chillingworth then reveals himself as Hester's long-lost husband. He admits his folly in marrying her, an old and deformed man, to her youth, acknowledging his ""first wrong."" He states he seeks no vengeance against *her*, but is determined to find the man who ""has wronged us both."" He pledges to discover the secret father, promising that he will not betray him to public law or harm his life, but vows, ""He shall be mine!"" Chillingworth then extracts a solemn oath from Hester: she must never reveal his true identity as her husband to anyone in the New World. He warns that if she fails him, the father's ""fame, his position, his life, will be in my hands."" Hester, appalled but bound by her oath, agrees. Chillingworth leaves her, smiling ominously. Hester questions if she has made a pact with the ""Black Man.""

**V. Hester at Her Needle & VI. Pearl**
Released from prison, Hester chooses to remain in Boston, settling in an isolated cottage on the peninsula. She supports herself and Pearl through exquisite needlework, which becomes highly sought after, adorning the garments of officials, military men, and even shrouds for the dead, but notably never a bride's veil. Her own dress is coarse and somber, with the scarlet letter as her only ornament. Pearl, however, is dressed in rich, fanciful garments, reflecting Hester's suppressed passion and serving as a living symbol of her sin.
Hester feels deeply isolated, an outcast reviled by many, yet she performs acts of charity for the poor and sick, who often return her kindness with insults. She develops a ""sympathetic knowledge of the hidden sin in other hearts,"" which both terrifies and perturbs her, as she perceives hypocrisy among supposedly pious figures.
Pearl, named because she was ""of great price,"" is a wild, capricious, and precocious child, often compared to an ""elf-child"" or ""demon offspring."" She has a fierce temper and is isolated from other children, who scorn her. Pearl's earliest awareness seems to have been of the scarlet letter, which she often points at and torments Hester with. She questions her mother about its meaning and why Reverend Dimmesdale always keeps his hand over his heart. Pearl even claims she was not sent by a Heavenly Father, but ""plucked... off the bush of wild roses that grew by the prison-door.""

**VII. The Governor's Hall & VIII. The Elf-Child and the Minister**
Hester visits Governor Bellingham's mansion to deliver embroidered gloves and, more urgently, to prevent the magistrates from taking Pearl away, as there are concerns about Hester's fitness as a mother and Pearl's possible ""demon origin."" Pearl, dressed in crimson and gold, looks like ""the scarlet letter in another form; the scarlet letter endowed with life!"" Puritan children try to throw mud at them, but Pearl aggressively drives them off.
At the Governor's hall, Hester finds Governor Bellingham, Reverend John Wilson, Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale, and Roger Chillingworth. Pearl's wild behavior and her inability to answer who made her (she claims to be plucked from the rose-bush) confirm the officials' doubts about Hester's upbringing of the child. The Governor and Mr. Wilson decide to remove Pearl from Hester's care.
Hester vehemently protests, pleading that God gave her Pearl as a blessing and a torment, and that Pearl keeps her alive and punishes her, acting as a living scarlet letter. She desperately appeals to Dimmesdale, reminding him of his pastoral care and her heart's secrets. Dimmesdale, pale and holding his hand over his heart, advocates for Hester, arguing that God sent Pearl as a means of salvation for Hester, reminding her of her sin while also offering a path to heaven through nurturing the child. His powerful speech convinces the magistrates to let Hester keep Pearl, on the condition that Pearl receives religious instruction.
In a rare tender moment, Pearl takes Dimmesdale's hand and he kisses her brow. As Hester and Pearl leave, Mistress Hibbins, the Governor's sister (who is later executed as a witch), invites Hester to a midnight meeting in the forest with the ""Black Man."" Hester refuses, stating she must guard Pearl, but hints that if Pearl had been taken, she would have gone willingly. Mistress Hibbins ominously replies, ""We shall have thee there anon!""

**IX. The Leech & X. The Leech and His Patient**
Roger Chillingworth, concealing his true identity, settles in Boston as a physician and begins treating the ailing Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale. Dimmesdale's health is rapidly deteriorating, marked by extreme paleness, a tremulous voice, and a habit of pressing his hand over his heart. Chillingworth becomes Dimmesdale's live-in physician, subtly probing the minister's physical and spiritual state, convinced that a hidden secret is the root of his illness. The townspeople, initially grateful for Chillingworth's presence, gradually grow suspicious, perceiving an evil change in his appearance and suspecting him to be an ""emissary of Satan"" sent to torment their holy minister.
Chillingworth gathers strange, dark herbs from a tombstone-less grave, suggesting they grew from an unconfessed secret buried with the dead man. He presses Dimmesdale to reveal any hidden ""wound or trouble in your soul."" Dimmesdale passionately refuses to confess to an ""earthly physician,"" asserting he will only confess to God.
Despite this outburst, their intimacy is re-established. One noonday, while Dimmesdale sleeps, Chillingworth secretly examines his breast, pulling aside his vestment. The text implies Chillingworth discovers a hidden mark or symptom. The physician reacts with a ""wild look of wonder, joy, and horror,"" a ""ghastly rapture,"" confirming his discovery of the minister's secret sin.

**XI. The Interior of a Heart & XII. The Minister’s Vigil**
Chillingworth, now certain of Dimmesdale's hidden guilt, begins a subtle, prolonged psychological torment. He becomes an ""arch-fiend"" playing upon the minister's conscience, inflicting ""agony"" and ""sudden fear."" Dimmesdale dimly senses this evil influence but cannot pinpoint its source, attributing his instinctive revulsion to his own morbid state.
Ironically, Dimmesdale's profound suffering enhances his eloquence and spiritual power in the pulpit, making him an even more revered figure among the townspeople. He longs to confess his hypocrisy but finds that his vague self-condemnations are interpreted by the people as further proof of his holiness. He resorts to secret self-punishment: scourging himself, fasting, and keeping vigils, during which he experiences vivid, tormenting visions of demons, his deceased parents, and Hester and Pearl pointing at his breast.
One night, driven by despair, Dimmesdale goes to the public scaffold where Hester had endured her shame seven years prior. He stands there in a ""vain show of expiation,"" imagining the world gazing at a ""scarlet token on his naked breast."" He shrieks aloud. Only Governor Bellingham and Mistress Hibbins hear him, misinterpreting the sound.
Reverend Mr. Wilson passes by, returning from Governor Winthrop's deathbed, but does not see Dimmesdale. As morning approaches, Dimmesdale bursts into laughter at the thought of being discovered, which is answered by Pearl's laugh. Hester and Pearl approach, having been at Governor Winthrop's deathbed. Dimmesdale asks them to join him on the scaffold.
On the scaffold, the three form an ""electric chain."" Pearl asks if he will stand with them ""to-morrow noontide."" Dimmesdale refuses, but promises they will stand together ""At the great judgment day."" Suddenly, a meteor lights up the sky, appearing to Dimmesdale as an immense letter ""A."" He sees Chillingworth nearby and, overwhelmed with terror and hatred, asks Hester who the man is. Pearl whispers something unintelligible. Chillingworth then appears, pretending concern, and leads Dimmesdale home.
The next day, Dimmesdale preaches a powerful sermon. Afterwards, the sexton finds Dimmesdale's glove on the scaffold, attributing it to Satan, and mentions the meteor's ""A"" has been interpreted as ""Angel"" for Governor Winthrop. Dimmesdale denies hearing of it.

**XIII. Another View of Hester & XIV. Hester and the Physician**
Seven years after her public shaming, Hester Prynne's public standing has evolved. Her tireless charity and quiet dignity have led many to reinterpret the scarlet ""A"" as meaning ""Able."" She observes Dimmesdale's deteriorating condition and realizes Chillingworth's torment is destroying him. Feeling responsible, she resolves to reveal Chillingworth's true identity to Dimmesdale.
She encounters Chillingworth collecting herbs by the seashore. He tells her that the magistrates have considered removing her scarlet letter, and he himself advocated for it. Hester calmly replies that if she were worthy, it would fall away naturally. Hester is shocked by Chillingworth's transformed appearance, which now bears an evil, fiend-like aspect, his eyes glowing with ""red light.""
Hester confronts Chillingworth, accusing him of becoming a devil through his prolonged revenge. She confesses her error in keeping his identity secret, which has allowed him to torment Dimmesdale. Chillingworth, in turn, gloats over Dimmesdale's suffering, asserting that he kept him alive only to prolong his agony. He describes his revenge as a ""blacker"" sin than Dimmesdale's. Hester pities Chillingworth, urging him to forgive and cease his evil. Chillingworth refuses, declaring their shared fate and returning to his herb-gathering.

**XV. Hester and Pearl & XVI. A Forest Walk**
Hester reflects on her hatred for Chillingworth and her regret over their marriage. Pearl, meanwhile, plays by the brook and creates a green letter ""A"" from eel-grass for her own bosom. She repeatedly questions Hester about the scarlet letter's meaning and Dimmesdale's habit of holding his hand over his heart. Hester, exasperated, tells Pearl she once met the ""Black Man"" in the forest and the scarlet letter is his mark.
Hester and Pearl take a walk in the forest to meet Dimmesdale. Pearl observes that the sunshine avoids Hester but embraces her, suggesting it's because of the scarlet letter. Pearl again questions Hester about the ""Black Man,"" asking if Dimmesdale's hand over his heart is his mark from the Black Man. Hester instructs Pearl to play while she speaks with the minister.

**XVII. The Pastor and His Parishioner & XVIII. A Flood of Sunshine**
Hester and Dimmesdale meet in the secluded forest. They are hesitant, like ghosts, initially speaking of mundane things. Dimmesdale confesses his profound misery, the torment of his hidden sin, and the agony of the public's reverence. He yearns for someone to whom he can confess his true self.
Hester reveals Chillingworth's true identity as her husband and his vengeful machinations. Dimmesdale collapses in horror and rage, accusing Hester of his suffering. Hester begs for his forgiveness, embracing him. Dimmesdale eventually forgives her, saying Chillingworth's revenge is a greater sin than theirs. They acknowledge the ""consecration of its own"" in their past act.
Hester urges Dimmesdale to flee with her and Pearl, either into the wilderness or across the sea to Europe, to escape Chillingworth and begin a new life free from shame. Dimmesdale, feeling too weak to face the world alone, initially despairs. Hester then declares, ""Thou shalt not go alone!""
With this decision made, Hester unclasps and casts away the scarlet letter into the withered leaves by the brook. She removes her cap, letting her abundant hair fall, and her beauty and youth return. A ""flood of sunshine"" breaks through the forest, symbolizing their newfound hope and freedom.
Hester calls Pearl to join them.

**XIX. The Child at the Brook-Side**
Pearl approaches slowly, observing her mother and Dimmesdale. Pearl is hesitant to cross the brook. Dimmesdale is anxious, noting children's customary avoidance of him. Pearl points emphatically at Hester's bare chest, then at the discarded scarlet letter by the brook. Hester realizes Pearl will not cross until she wears the letter again. Hester retrieves the letter, and as she fastens it back on, her beauty and warmth vanish, replaced by a ""gray shadow."" Pearl then bounds across the brook, embraces Hester, and kisses her, but also pointedly kisses the scarlet letter.
Pearl asks if Dimmesdale loves them and if he will walk ""hand in hand, we three together, into the town."" Hester assures her he will in the future, but not today. Pearl, still wary, washes off Dimmesdale's kiss in the brook. Hester and Dimmesdale then finalize their plan to escape on a ship bound for Bristol in three days.

**XX. The Minister in a Maze**
As Dimmesdale returns to town from the forest, he feels an unaccustomed surge of physical energy and a profound inner transformation. He experiences strange, wicked impulses, almost uttering blasphemies to a deacon, arguments against immortality to an old woman, and nearly corrupting a young maiden. He encounters Mistress Hibbins, who hints at his ""airing in the forest"" with the ""Black Man,"" confirming Dimmesdale's fear that he has made a pact with the fiend.
Back in his study, Chillingworth visits, feigning concern for Dimmesdale's health and upcoming Election Sermon, but his true, malevolent intent is now clear to Dimmesdale. Dimmesdale rejects Chillingworth's medical aid. Alone, he burns his unfinished sermon and writes a new, inspired Election Sermon through the night, feeling he is an impure vessel for God's grand message.

**XXI. The New England Holiday**
On Election Day, Hester and Pearl are in the bustling market-place, filled with townspeople, Indians, and mariners. Hester, in her coarse gray dress, bears the scarlet letter, which has now become a familiar, almost respected, symbol due to her good deeds. Pearl, adorned in splendid garments, is agitated. Pearl observes Dimmesdale in the procession, noting his strange behavior of acknowledging them in the forest but not in public. Mistress Hibbins again approaches Hester, implying her knowledge of Dimmesdale's secret connection to the ""Black Man"" and predicting his hidden mark will be revealed.
Hester stands near the scaffold, listening to Dimmesdale's powerful and moving Election Sermon, which, despite its indistinct words, conveys a deep ""cry of pain."" Pearl plays among the crowd, fearlessly interacting with Indians and mariners. One shipmaster tells Pearl to inform Hester that Chillingworth has arranged passage for ""his friend, the gentleman she wots of"" (Dimmesdale) on the same ship they planned to take, revealing that Chillingworth knows their escape plan. Hester is filled with dread, realizing their ""inevitable doom.""

**XXII. The Procession & XXIII. The Revelation of the Scarlet Letter**
The Election Sermon ends, and Dimmesdale emerges from the church, looking feeble and pale, his earlier vigor gone. He moves towards the scaffold where Hester and Pearl stand. Chillingworth, seeing Dimmesdale's intent, rushes forward, grasping the minister's arm, urging him to stop, to protect his fame and sacred profession, promising to save him. Dimmesdale, however, defies Chillingworth, declaring, ""Ha, tempter! Methinks thou art too late! ... With God’s help, I shall escape thee now!""
He calls Hester and Pearl to him. With Hester supporting him and Pearl holding his hand, Dimmesdale ascends the scaffold. Chillingworth follows, darkly remarking that the scaffold was the one place Dimmesdale could not escape him.
Dimmesdale, now dying, addresses the multitude. He confesses his sin, proclaiming himself ""the one sinner of the world!"" He reveals that he should have stood on that scaffold seven years ago with Hester. He then tears away his ministerial band, revealing a scarlet letter (implicitly an A) visibly imprinted on his own breast, stating it is the ""shadow of what he bears on his own breast.""
The crowd is horrified. Dimmesdale, with a ""flush of triumph,"" collapses. Hester supports him. Chillingworth kneels beside him, exclaiming, ""Thou hast escaped me!"" Dimmesdale tells Chillingworth, ""May God forgive thee! Thou, too, hast deeply sinned!""
Dimmesdale then asks Pearl to kiss him, which she does, breaking a ""spell."" Her tears fall on his cheek, symbolizing her transition to human sympathy. Hester asks if they will meet again in eternity. Dimmesdale expresses doubt about their reunion due to their broken law and sin, but affirms God's mercy in his afflictions, which led him to this public death and saved him. He says farewell and dies.

**XXIV. Conclusion**
After Dimmesdale's death, various theories circulate regarding the scarlet letter on his breast: some believe he self-inflicted it as penance, others that Chillingworth used magic and poison, and some that it was the physical manifestation of his gnawing remorse. Some witnesses, however, denied seeing any mark or any confession of guilt from Dimmesdale, interpreting his death as a parable about human righteousness. The narrator, citing Mr. Surveyor Pue's manuscript, confirms the mark and Dimmesdale's confession, offering the moral: ""Be true! Be true! Be true! Show freely to the world, if not your worst, yet some trait whereby the worst may be inferred!""
Roger Chillingworth, deprived of his object of revenge, rapidly withers away and dies within a year, having lost his life's purpose. In his will, he leaves a ""very considerable amount of property"" to little Pearl, making her a wealthy heiress.
Soon after Chillingworth's death, Hester and Pearl disappear from Boston. Years later, Hester Prynne returns to her isolated cottage, still wearing the scarlet letter, which has now transformed into a symbol of reverence and awe due to her self-devotion and good deeds. She voluntarily resumes her penance.
Pearl's fate is not explicitly stated, but evidence (letters, luxurious items in the cottage, Hester embroidering a baby-garment) suggests she lived a life of comfort and happiness in another land, married and mindful of her mother.
Hester, as a ""Sister of Mercy,"" counsels women with their own sorrows. She expresses her belief that a ""new truth would be revealed"" in the future, establishing a ""surer ground of mutual happiness"" for man and woman, though she recognizes she cannot be its prophetess due to her past sin.
After many more years, Hester dies and is buried in a new grave near an old, sunken one (implicitly Dimmesdale's) in the same burial-ground, but with a space between them. A single, simple tombstone covers both, bearing the inscription: ""ON A FIELD, SABLE, THE LETTER A, GULES."""
Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea-Jules Verne,"**Plot Summary of Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea**

The year 1866 was marked by the appearance of a mysterious, enormous, spindle-shaped, and occasionally phosphorescent object in the world's oceans. This object, far larger and faster than any known whale, caused significant alarm and speculation among maritime populations and governments. Several vessels reported encounters: the steamer *Governor Higginson* off Australia (July 20, 1866) observed it ejecting water, the *Columbus* in the Pacific (July 23) noted its speed, and the *Helvetia* and *Shannon* in the Atlantic (fifteen days later) estimated its length at over 350 feet. Collisions with other ships, like the *Etna*, and official surveys by frigates further confirmed its existence. Initially a scientific curiosity, it soon became a public danger, especially after the *Moravian* (March 5, 1867) and the *Scotia* (April 13, 1867) suffered significant hull damage from striking the object, revealing a perfect, triangular rent in the *Scotia*'s iron plates. The public demanded action against this ""monster"" responsible for numerous shipwrecks.

Professor Pierre Aronnax, an Assistant Professor at the Museum of Natural History in Paris, returning from an expedition in Nebraska, found himself deeply immersed in the mystery upon his arrival in New York in March 1867. Dismissing theories of floating islands or wrecks due to the object's incredible speed, the debate narrowed to either a colossal sea monster or an advanced submarine vessel. Aronnax, consulted by many, published an article in the *New York Herald* proposing the existence of a gigantic, electrically-charged narwhal with a powerful horn, capable of inflicting the observed damage. This hypothesis gained traction, and the United States government commissioned the frigate *Abraham Lincoln*, commanded by Captain Farragut, for an expedition to hunt the creature.

After two months of no sightings, news arrived that the ""animal"" had been seen in the North Pacific. Aronnax received an invitation from the Secretary of Marine, J.B. Hobson, to join the expedition. Despite his desire to return to France, Aronnax, seeing a unique scientific opportunity, accepted. His loyal Flemish servant, Conseil, who had accompanied him on all his travels, readily agreed to follow, despite the danger. They boarded the *Abraham Lincoln* at Brooklyn, a high-speed frigate, though Aronnax doubted it could match the monster's velocity. The frigate departed amidst public cheers, sailing into the Atlantic.

On board, Captain Farragut was determined to destroy the monster, a conviction shared by his officers. A $2000 reward was offered for its first sighting. The ship was heavily armed, and its crew included Ned Land, a famed Canadian harpooner known for his skill. Ned, however, was the sole disbeliever, arguing no sea creature could inflict such damage. Aronnax attempted to convince him by explaining the immense pressure of the deep ocean and the colossal strength required for an animal to survive there, but Ned remained skeptical about the creature's existence.

The voyage was long and largely uneventful, save for an instance where Ned Land expertly harpooned two whales, showcasing his prowess. The *Abraham Lincoln* rounded Cape Horn and entered the Pacific. After three months of fruitless searching, morale dwindled. Captain Farragut, facing discontent, promised three more days of search before abandoning the mission. On the night of November 4, as the deadline loomed, Ned Land suddenly cried out, spotting a large, luminous object on the starboard beam.

The entire crew rushed to the side. Two cable lengths away, an immense, oval, intensely phosphorescent object emerged, emitting an inexplicable electric light. Aronnax identified it as an electrical phenomenon. Captain Farragut tried to evade it, but the object, moving at twice the frigate's speed, circled them with electric rings, then rushed towards them, stopping abruptly 20 feet away before its light vanished and reappeared on the other side. Farragut decided to wait for daylight to attack, confirming his belief that it was a gigantic, electric narwhal. The crew remained on high alert. Around 1 AM, a deafening whistle was heard, and at 2 AM, the light reappeared five miles off, accompanied by loud tail beats and panting sounds.

At daybreak, after a thick fog cleared, Ned Land sighted the object again – a blackish body a yard above the waves, with a violently agitated tail. Aronnax estimated its length at 250 feet. Captain Farragut ordered full steam, and the *Abraham Lincoln* pursued. The object, however, easily outpaced the frigate, matching its maximum speed of 19.3 miles per hour. After an hour, the captain ordered a shot from the forecastle gun. The first shot missed; the second struck the object but glanced off its hard surface. The chase continued into the night. At 10:50 PM, the object reappeared, motionless. Captain Farragut cautiously approached. Ned Land, from the bowsprit, hurled his harpoon, which struck with a metallic sound. The electric light extinguished, two massive waterspouts erupted over the frigate's deck, and Aronnax was thrown overboard.

Aronnax, a strong swimmer, resurfaced, but saw the *Abraham Lincoln* disappearing. He was sinking when his loyal servant, Conseil, rescued him, explaining that he had followed his master into the sea. Conseil reported that the frigate's screw and rudder were broken. They decided to conserve energy by taking turns floating and swimming, hoping for rescue. Exhausted, Aronnax eventually lost consciousness. He awoke to Ned Land's voice. Ned explained he had also been thrown into the sea but found refuge on the ""gigantic narwhal"" itself, only to discover it was ""made of sheet iron."" Aronnax examined the object, confirming its metallic, riveted plate construction—it was a submarine boat. As the ""fish of steel"" began to move, Aronnax, Conseil, and Ned clung to its upper part. Later, a panel opened, and eight masked men forcibly brought them inside the formidable machine.

Trapped in darkness, Ned Land was furious, fearing cannibals, while Conseil remained calm. The cabin was suddenly illuminated by an intense electric light. Two men appeared: a short, muscular individual and a taller, evidently commanding figure with cold, confident eyes. Aronnax attempted to communicate in French, English, German, and Latin, but received no response. The men left. Later, a steward, mute and impassive, brought them clothes and a meal of marine produce (fish, turtle fillet, dolphin liver, sea-weed products). Each utensil bore the letter ""N"" and the motto ""MOBILIS IN MOBILI."" Aronnax realized their host was a civilized, albeit mysterious, individual. After the meal, the others slept, but Aronnax remained awake, pondering their strange situation.

He awoke to stale air, realizing the vessel had to surface for oxygen. A current of fresh air soon confirmed the *Nautilus* (as he later learned its name) had indeed surfaced. The steward reappeared, but Ned, driven by hunger and anger, attacked him. The commander of the vessel intervened, speaking perfect French, revealing he understood all their languages and had deliberately observed them. He introduced himself as Captain Nemo and his vessel as the *Nautilus*. He explained that they had ""troubled his existence"" by pursuing him. He stated he had ""broken all ties of humanity"" and lived outside society's laws. He offered them freedom on board, provided they accepted confinement during ""unforeseen events"" to protect his secrets. Ned Land refused to give his word of honor to not escape. Aronnax argued it was cruelty, but Nemo countered it was clemency, as he could have drowned them. He revealed his knowledge of Aronnax's scientific work and promised to show him ""the land of marvels."" Aronnax accepted the terms, curious about this extraordinary man and his submarine.

Captain Nemo then led Aronnax on a tour. The *Nautilus* was 232 feet long, 26 feet wide, made of two steel hulls, and weighed 1500 tons. It was powered entirely by electricity, generated from sodium extracted from seawater, which also provided heat and light. Nemo showed him various advanced instruments, including a manometer for depth and an electric log for speed (50 miles/hour possible). He explained how the *Nautilus* submerged (filling water reservoirs), surfaced (emptying them with powerful electric pumps), and steered using a rudder and inclined planes. An electric reflector illuminated their path. Nemo confirmed the *Scotia* incident was accidental, but the *Abraham Lincoln* attack was a defense. He revealed the *Nautilus* was secretly built from parts sourced globally and assembled on a desert island, then all traces destroyed. He was immensely rich, with his wealth stored in the ocean.

The *Nautilus* continued its journey, crossing the Pacific. Aronnax learned their position using maps provided by Captain Nemo. He observed the Kuro-Scivo, a ""Black River"" current they followed. One day, the saloon panels opened, revealing the brilliantly lit submarine world through crystal plates, teeming with diverse fish. After exploring the library's 12,000 volumes, Aronnax, Conseil, and Ned were invited by Captain Nemo to a ""hunting-party"" on Crespo Island. To their surprise, this meant an underwater excursion. Nemo explained their use of modified Rouquayrol apparatus for breathing (9-10 hours of air from compressed reservoirs) and Ruhmkorff lamps for light. Their weapons were air-guns firing electric glass cases that rendered any target instantly dead.

Equipped in heavy diving suits, they were transferred to a small room that filled with water, then exited through a side door onto the seabed. Aronnax marveled at the transparent water, vibrant coral formations, and abundant marine life. They walked for hours, eventually reaching a submarine forest where plants grew rigidly perpendicular. Aronnax and Conseil fell asleep during a rest but were awakened by a monstrous sea-spider, which Captain Nemo promptly killed. They descended to 75 fathoms, using their electric lamps in the deepening darkness. After a long walk, they reached a steep granite wall, the edge of Crespo Island, marking the boundary of Nemo's domain. On the way back, Nemo shot a valuable sea-otter and his companion an albatross. Near the *Nautilus*, they narrowly escaped two formidable sharks, after which they re-entered the submarine.

Days turned into weeks. The *Nautilus* continued its journey, often at depths between 100 and 150 yards, traveling southeast. They passed Hawaii and the Marquesas. One day, stationary at 1000 yards, they observed the wreck of ""The Florida, Sunderland,"" a ship with corpses still bound to its deck, including a woman holding an infant. Captain Nemo then took them to Vanikoro, the island where La Pérouse's expedition was lost. Nemo showed Aronnax the debris of the lost French vessels and revealed he knew the fate of La Pérouse's third, smaller boat: it was lost near the Solomon Islands. He displayed a tin-plate box containing La Pérouse's instructions, noting, ""A coral tomb makes a quiet grave; and I trust that I and my comrades will find no other.""

The *Nautilus* then sailed at high speed through the dangerous Torres Straits, where it ran aground near Gilboa Island. Captain Nemo assured them the spring tide would free them. Ned Land, seeing an opportunity, convinced Aronnax to ask Captain Nemo for permission to go ashore. Nemo surprisingly agreed, and they enjoyed two days on the uninhabited island, hunting and gathering food, delighting in fresh meat and fruit. On their second day, while gathering shells, a native's stone broke Conseil's rare shell. Conseil aimed his gun at the native, but Aronnax stopped him, stating a shell was not worth a human life. Soon, numerous Papuan natives in canoes surrounded the *Nautilus*, firing arrows. Aronnax warned Captain Nemo, who calmly ordered the hatches closed, stating the vessel was impregnable. He refused to harm the ""poor creatures"" by allowing them to be killed. The next morning, as the tide prepared to free the *Nautilus*, the Papuans, more numerous, crowded the platform. Captain Nemo, to Aronnax's astonishment, had electrified the handrail of the central staircase. When natives attempted to board, they were violently repelled by electric shocks. Ned Land, also attempting to board, was thrown back, realizing the trap. The *Nautilus* then floated free at the predicted time and sailed away.

The *Nautilus* then turned west, travelling at extraordinary speed into the Indian Ocean. Captain Nemo conducted experiments on the sea's temperature at extreme depths, reaching 16,000 yards (four leagues). Aronnax observed incredible phosphorescent phenomena caused by luminous animalcules and witnessed a ""wholesale massacre"" of cachalots (sperm whales) by the *Nautilus*'s spur, as Captain Nemo sought to exterminate these ""mischievous creatures"" that preyed on the inoffensive baleen whales. From a dead whale, the crew extracted milk to be preserved for food. Ned Land's resentment towards Captain Nemo intensified.

The *Nautilus* continued its southerly course, penetrating the Antarctic polar circle. They navigated through massive icebergs and ice-fields, often having to smash through the ice. On March 18, the *Nautilus* became completely trapped by a colossal iceberg. Captain Nemo, unfazed, announced his intention to reach the South Pole by going *under* the ice. He explained the *Nautilus*'s ability to withstand immense pressure and break through ice. After preparing air reservoirs, the *Nautilus* descended beneath the iceberg. On March 19, after several attempts to surface through the thick ice, Captain Nemo announced, ""The sea is open!"" They had reached an open polar sea.

They landed on a volcanic island, a vast continent of rocks and ice, teeming with thousands of birds and sea-mammals (seals, sea-elephants, morses). On March 21, the equinox, Captain Nemo, using a chronometer and sextant, confirmed they were precisely at the South Pole. He claimed possession of this region in his own name, unfurling a black banner with a golden ""N."" He declared six months of night would begin.

However, the following day, March 22, a violent shock threw Aronnax from his bed. The *Nautilus* had been struck by an overturning iceberg, had rebounded, and was now lying on its starboard side at 180 fathoms depth. Captain Nemo admitted it was a serious ""accident,"" not an ""incident."" While pumps worked to right the vessel, another ice block shifted, completely blocking their egress. They were trapped. Their air supply would last only two days. To combat the encroaching solidification of the water around them, Captain Nemo ordered jets of boiling water to be pumped out, raising the temperature. Aronnax, Ned, and Conseil suffered from severe air depletion as they and the crew worked tirelessly with pickaxes to clear the ice. Conseil and Ned even sacrificed their remaining air for Aronnax. On March 28, the sixth day of their imprisonment, Captain Nemo resolved to crush the last yard of ice. The *Nautilus* was lightened, floated over the trench, then filled with water to gain weight and dropped onto the remaining ice, which cracked and gave way. The vessel plunged rapidly, then ascended, breaking through the last ice sheet. The panel opened, and fresh air flooded the *Nautilus*.

With freedom, the *Nautilus* sailed north through the Atlantic. Aronnax expressed his profound gratitude to Ned and Conseil, who promised to take him with them when they finally escaped. They sighted Terra del Fuego and the Falkland Islands, then followed the South American coast northward, crossing the Tropic of Capricorn. They observed immense submarine valleys and the mouth of the Amazon River, where Aronnax studied diverse marine life. During this time, Conseil was temporarily paralyzed by a dangerous electric cramp-fish. They passed sea-cows (manatees), whose ecological role in preventing tropical disease Aronnax explained.

The *Nautilus* continued into the Antilles, then the Gulf Stream. Ned Land, seeing their proximity to North American shores, became desperate to escape, but violent storms made it impossible. Aronnax, also suffering homesickness, confronted Captain Nemo about their indefinite imprisonment. Nemo, absorbed in writing his life story for a floating capsule, reiterated his firm stance: ""Whoever enters the *Nautilus*, must never quit it."" He dismissed Ned's desire for liberty, stating his own reasons for living apart from humanity.

A severe hurricane struck the *Nautilus* near Long Island, New York. Captain Nemo, in an ""unaccountable caprice,"" braved the tempest on the surface, seemingly courting death. Aronnax, witnessing the raw power of the storm and Nemo's defiance, was overwhelmed. The *Nautilus* eventually submerged to find tranquility.

Days later, the *Nautilus* passed over the transatlantic electric cable off Newfoundland, which Aronnax described in detail. Continuing eastward, it reached a point 120 miles from Ireland, where Captain Nemo sought a specific location. On June 1, the *Nautilus* located the wreck of ""The Avenger"" (formerly ""The Marseillais""), a French warship that had sunk heroically rather than surrender in battle 74 years prior. Captain Nemo, deeply emotional, revealed his profound hatred, stating he had lost ""country, wife, children, father, and mother"" through the actions of the ""oppressor,"" implying this ship belonged to a nation he sought vengeance against.

The *Nautilus* rose to the surface. A warship, an armored ram, was sighted, firing upon them. Ned Land tried to signal the ship, but Captain Nemo violently struck him down, declaring, ""Ah, ship of an accursed nation, you know who I am! ... Look! and I will show you mine!"" He unfurled his black banner with a gold ""N."" He ordered Aronnax and his companions below, announcing his intent to sink the vessel, refusing to be judged. Aronnax, Ned, and Conseil were forced to witness the impending tragedy.

The *Nautilus* submerged. Aronnax, Ned, and Conseil tried to escape through the boat, but the upper panel closed, and the *Nautilus* descended. Aronnax understood it was too late. The *Nautilus* struck the warship below its waterline, passing ""like a needle through sailcloth!"" Aronnax rushed to the saloon, where Captain Nemo watched impassively through the panel as the ship, ""The Avenger's"" ruins not to be mingled with its, sank. He saw the crew clinging to the masts, then an explosion, and the entire vessel, with its human cargo, disappeared into the abyss. Captain Nemo, his face pale with hatred, then went to his room. Aronnax, following with his eyes, saw a portrait of a young woman and two children on the wall. Captain Nemo knelt before it, stretching his arms towards them, and burst into deep sobs.

Aronnax felt immense horror for Captain Nemo, considering his vengeance unjustified. The *Nautilus* sped northward at frightful speed, passing the mouth of the English Channel. Aronnax lost track of time, haunted by nightmares. Ned Land, at the end of his patience, became withdrawn. One morning, Ned woke Aronnax, revealing they were near land (20 miles east) and planned to escape that night. Despite the violent sea, Ned had secured food and water for the small boat. Aronnax agreed, determined to escape, even if it meant death. At 9:30 PM, Aronnax heard Captain Nemo playing his organ in the saloon, a sad, longing melody. He realized he must cross the saloon to reach the boat. As he crept through the darkened saloon, he heard Captain Nemo rise and murmur, ""Almighty God! enough! enough!"" Aronnax, in desperation, rushed into the boat where Ned and Conseil were waiting. Ned sealed the *Nautilus*'s opening with a false key and began unfastening the bolts. Suddenly, voices cried, ""The maelstrom! the maelstrom!"" They realized the *Nautilus* was being drawn into the terrible Maelstrom whirlpool off the coast of Norway. The *Nautilus* spun in a tightening spiral, and their small boat, still attached, was carried along. The roar of the water was deafening. Ned urged them to hold on to the *Nautilus*, but with a crashing noise, the bolts gave way, and the boat was hurled into the whirlpool. Aronnax struck his head and lost consciousness.

Aronnax's account ends with his regaining consciousness in a fisherman's hut on the Loffoden Isles, with Ned Land and Conseil safe. He does not know how they escaped the Maelstrom or what became of the *Nautilus* or Captain Nemo. He hopes the vessel survived and that Nemo, his hatred appeased, has continued his peaceful exploration as a philosopher of the sea. Aronnax concludes that only he and Captain Nemo have the right to answer the question, ""That which is far off and exceeding deep, who can find it out?"""
Ulysses-James Joyce,"The text provided follows the experiences and thoughts of three main characters—Stephen Dedalus, Leopold Bloom, and Molly Bloom—over the course of a single day, June 16, 1904, in Dublin.

**Part I: Morning**

**Chapter 1: Stephen Dedalus at the Martello Tower**
The story begins at a Martello Tower where Stephen Dedalus is staying with Buck Mulligan and Haines. Buck Mulligan, a medical student, enters dramatically, performing a mock Mass with shaving supplies. He greets Stephen with teasing remarks, calling him ""Kinch."" Stephen, who is sleepy and displeased, leans on the staircase, observing Mulligan.

Mulligan mocks Stephen's name, suggesting they go to Athens. Stephen asks about Haines, an English visitor, and Mulligan describes him as a ""ponderous Saxon"" who doubts Stephen's gentility. Stephen recounts Haines's disturbing raving about a black panther the previous night, expressing fear and threatening to leave if Haines remains. Mulligan, searching for a cloth, borrows Stephen’s dirty handkerchief, calling it ""snotgreen"" and suggesting it as a new art color for Irish poets.

Looking out over Dublin Bay, Mulligan calls the sea a ""great sweet mother,"" but then abruptly tells Stephen that his aunt believes Stephen killed his mother. Stephen responds grimly, ""Someone killed her."" Mulligan criticizes Stephen for refusing to kneel and pray for his dying mother, calling him sinister. Stephen recalls his mother's death, her wasted body, and the scent of wax and rosewood, feeling pain and sadness over her unfulfilled last wish.

Mulligan offers Stephen old clothes, but Stephen declines grey trousers. Mulligan mocks his refusal, linking it to Stephen's supposed matricide. He then mentions a rumor that Stephen has ""general paralysis of the insane."" Mulligan shows Stephen a cracked mirror, calling him a ""dreadful bard."" Stephen defines it as ""a symbol of Irish art."" Mulligan, in a kinder moment, suggests they work together to ""Hellenise"" Ireland.

Stephen confronts Mulligan about his cruel remark after his mother’s death: ""O, it’s only Dedalus whose mother is beastly dead."" Mulligan defends himself, arguing that death is meaningless and criticizes Stephen’s inability to pray. A voice calls Mulligan down for breakfast. Mulligan advises Stephen not to ""mope,"" then descends singing. Stephen reflects on his mother's death and a sense of betrayal.

Mulligan calls Stephen again, mentioning that Haines admired Stephen's ""Irish art"" comment and suggesting Stephen ask Haines for money. Stephen says he’s getting paid that morning. Mulligan asks for a loan of one quid for a ""glorious drunk."" Stephen agrees. Mulligan leaves, singing. Stephen picks up the abandoned shaving bowl, then locks the tower door, taking the key.

Outside, Mulligan asks for the key. Stephen confirms he has it. Haines asks about the tower's rent, which Mulligan states is ""Twelve quid."" Stephen adds it's paid ""To the secretary of state for war."" Haines comments on the tower and asks Stephen’s opinion on Hamlet. Mulligan interjects, jokingly describing Stephen's elaborate ""algebraic proof"" that Hamlet is his own father's ghost. Mulligan then sings a blasphemous song about ""Joseph the joiner."" After Mulligan runs down the cliff, Haines comments on his blasphemy. Stephen identifies the song. Haines offers Stephen a cigarette and questions his belief in God. Stephen calls himself ""a horrible example of free thought,"" reflecting on his masters and the church.

They descend to the creek. Mulligan, in shirtsleeves, prepares to swim. An elderly man and a young man named Seymour are present. Mulligan gets ready to enter the water, joking about redheaded women and claiming he and Stephen are ""supermen."" Stephen, feeling detached, gives Mulligan the key and two pennies for a pint. Mulligan jumps into the sea. Haines says he'll see Stephen at ""The Ship"" at half past twelve. Stephen walks away, contemplating Mulligan as a ""Usurper.""

**Chapter 2: Stephen Dedalus at Mr Deasy's School**
Stephen is teaching a history lesson at Mr Deasy’s school. He questions the boys about Pyrrhus and the Battle of Asculum. Armstrong gives a simplistic definition of a pier, which draws laughter. Stephen refines it, calling Kingstown pier ""a disappointed bridge."" He reflects on history as a ""tale"" and his own role.

He asks the boys for a story, and Talbot recites from ""Lycidas."" Stephen's thoughts wander into philosophical and theological reflections on existence and forms. He then poses a riddle about a fox burying his grandmother, which the boys cannot solve. Stephen gives the answer, eliciting nervous laughter.

The boys leave for hockey. Sargent, a slow student, remains to show Stephen his sums. Stephen assists him, reflecting on Sargent's mother and his own deceased mother. Mr Deasy calls Stephen to his study.

In the study, Mr Deasy pays Stephen his salary (£3 12s), lecturing him on the value of money and the English pride in ""paying their way."" Stephen mentally lists his own debts. Mr Deasy discusses Irish politics, mentioning his ancestor who voted for the Union. He then asks Stephen to get a letter published in the press concerning foot-and-mouth disease, which he believes is a sign of ""England is in the hands of the jews"" and its decay. Stephen challenges this, defining a merchant neutrally. Mr Deasy asserts Jews ""sinned against the light"" and are ""wanderers."" Stephen declares, ""History... is a nightmare from which I am trying to awake.""

Mr Deasy attributes sin to women (Helen of Troy, Parnell's downfall) and proclaims his loyalty to Ulster. Stephen agrees to try and get the letter published in the _Evening Telegraph_. As Stephen leaves, Mr Deasy calls him back to proudly state that Ireland is the only country never to persecute Jews because ""she never let them in,"" and laughs heartily.

**Chapter 3: Stephen Dedalus on Sandymount Strand**
Stephen walks alone on Sandymount Strand, engaging in deep philosophical meditations on sensory experience, time, and existence. He observes two women, ""Frauenzimmer,"" on the beach, and contemplates birth and the ""Womb of sin,"" recalling his own parents and the historical figure Arius. He remembers Mulligan's telegram and the plan to meet later.

He sees various objects on the beach, linking them to ""Ringsend"" and ""Human shells."" Realizing he has strayed from his intended path to his aunt Sara’s, he turns towards the Pigeonhouse. He vividly recalls memories of Paris and his friend Kevin Egan, a socialist who does not believe in God. He thinks of a telegram about his mother's death and Mulligan's aunt's accusations.

He walks along the south wall, admiring the ""gold light on sea."" He feels a connection to the sea and the land, reflecting on his ""people"" and their history. He sees a bloated dog carcass and then a live dog with two cocklepickers. The dog's actions remind him of the riddle he posed at school. He has a fragmented, dream-like memory of a ""street of harlots."" He observes the cocklepickers, ""the red Egyptians,"" and reflects on ""Morose delectation.""

He ponders his ""Hamlet hat"" and the idea of invisibility. He thinks of the moon and a woman. He tears off a piece of Mr Deasy's letter to write on, regretting not getting paper from the library. He reflects on his written words and who might read them. He then thinks of a virgin in a shop window and his own loneliness. He lies down on the rocks, feeling ""caught in this burning scene."" He thinks of his boots, ""buck’s castoffs.""

He reflects on the flowing tide, imagining the drowned man (""Full fathom five thy father lies"") and his inability to save his own mother. He thinks of death and the ""toothless Kinch, the superman."" He searches for his handkerchief, remembering he left it with Mulligan, and deposits ""dry snot"" on a rock. He sees a ship sailing silently, and identifies Mulligan as a ""Usurper.""

**Part II: Midday**

**Chapter 4: Leopold Bloom at Home**
Mr Leopold Bloom wakes up and begins his day by preparing breakfast for his wife, Molly, at their home on Eccles Street. He relishes the thought of inner organs of animals and feeds his cat milk. He goes upstairs, informs Molly he's going ""round the corner,"" and asks if she needs anything, to which she grunts a sleepy ""Mn."" He reflects on Molly’s bedstead and her father’s past. He realizes he has forgotten his latchkey, but doesn't want to disturb Molly, so he quietly closes the front door.

Walking through the streets, Bloom observes daily life and reflects on various topics, including Turkish culture and the layout of Dublin pubs. He stops at Dlugacz's pork butcher's, contemplating sausages and observing a young woman buying meat, whose ""vigorous hips"" attract his attention. He buys a pork kidney and, after paying, notes the woman's ""sodachapped hands.""

He then reads a pamphlet about ""Agendath Netaim,"" a company for planting trees in Palestine, which prompts reflections on oranges, olives, and a ""dead sea in a dead land."" Feeling a sense of ""desolation,"" he hurries home. He finds letters on the hall floor: one for Milly (his daughter), one for Molly, and a card for Molly. He gives them to Molly in bed, who tucks her letter under her pillow.

Molly asks for tea. Bloom scalds the teapot and fries the kidney. He reads Milly’s letter, which thanks him for a birthday present, mentions her photography job in Mullingar, a picnic, and a student named Bannon who sings ""Boylan’s song."" Bloom reflects on Milly's growing independence and his deceased son, Rudy.

After eating, Bloom feels a ""soft qualm"" about Milly becoming a woman. He goes to the outhouse, finding an old copy of _Titbits_ to read. While relieving himself, he reads a prize story, reflecting on his own writing ambitions and Molly's habits. He uses part of the story to wipe himself. He hears the bells of George's church tolling a quarter to eleven, thinking ""Poor Dignam!""

**Chapter 5: Leopold Bloom in the City**
Bloom walks through Dublin, passing various shops and people, reflecting on poverty and life. He thinks about Dignam's funeral, which is scheduled for eleven. At a tea company, he discreetly removes a card from his hatband and places it in his waistcoat. He thinks of Ceylon and the laws of physics.

At the post office, he retrieves a letter addressed to ""Henry Flower."" He passes a recruiting poster and considers soldiers. He then meets C.P. M'Coy, who asks about his well-being. Bloom tells him about Dignam's funeral. M'Coy, unable to attend, asks Bloom to sign his name on the condolence list. Bloom agrees.

Bloom thinks about Molly's upcoming concert tour and his father's suicide. He walks into Cumberland Street and reads his letter from Martha Clifford, his secret correspondent. Martha expresses anger about stamps he enclosed, asks for the meaning of ""metempsychosis,"" and inquires about his wife's perfume. Bloom tears off the enclosed yellow flower and places it in his heart pocket. He then tears up the envelope.

He visits All Hallows church, reflecting on Father Conmee, the African mission, and the Catholic rituals of communion, which he finds both strange and powerful. He thinks of Martha again and the possibility of a meeting. He notices a bald spot on the priest and connects it to ""I.H.S."" He also thinks of Molly’s singing.

Leaving the church, Bloom heads to Sweny's pharmacy to get a skin lotion recipe for Molly, asking about the ingredients. He buys a lemon-scented soap. Outside, he encounters Bantam Lyons, who asks to see his newspaper for horse racing results. Bloom, about to discard the paper, tells Lyons he can keep it. Lyons, misinterpreting this as a tip, hurries off to place a bet on ""Throwaway."" Bloom continues towards the Turkish baths.

**Chapter 6: Leopold Bloom at Dignam's Funeral**
Bloom joins Martin Cunningham, Mr Power, and Simon Dedalus in a funeral carriage for Paddy Dignam. He feels the soap he bought in his hip pocket. As the carriage begins to move, he observes the streets and reflects on death, preparing a body, and his own mortality.

Mr Dedalus comments on the funeral custom. Bloom spots Stephen walking and points him out to his father. Mr Dedalus is angered to see Stephen without Mulligan and launches into a tirade against Mulligan, calling him a ""bloody doubledyed ruffian"" who will ruin his son. Bloom silently reflects on his own dead son, Rudy, and his aspirations for him.

The conversation turns to the crumbs on the carriage seats, suggesting a ""picnic party."" Bloom is glad he took a bath earlier. They discuss who is at the funeral. The carriage halts by the Grand Canal. Bloom sees the gasworks and thinks of childhood illnesses and his dog, Athos. He notes a raindrop.

They discuss various topics, including Tom Kernan's performance and Dan Dawson's speech. Bloom scans the death notices in the newspaper for Dignam's name. They pass city landmarks. Mr Power points out Blazes Boylan. Bloom observes Boylan, feeling a mix of fascination and unease, and reflects on Molly’s figure.

Mr Power asks Bloom about Molly’s concert tour. Bloom says it's going well but he has ""private business"" in County Clare. He describes the tour plan. They pass Robert Emmet’s statue. Bloom thinks of Molly and her singing.

Martin Cunningham recounts a story about Reuben J Dodd’s son nearly drowning in the Liffey and being rescued for a florin. Mr Dedalus dryly comments it was ""one and eightpence too much."" They discuss Dignam's sudden death. Bloom states it was ""the best death"" because there was ""no suffering."" The conversation shifts to suicide, and Bloom, prompted by his own father’s suicide, nearly speaks but holds back.

They pass a child's coffin and the Mater Misericordiae hospital. Bloom thinks of the cattle being driven to market and suggests municipal funeral trams. Martin Cunningham recalls a hearse overturning, spilling the coffin. Bloom envisions decomposing bodies.

They reach Glasnevin Cemetery. Mr Dedalus weeps at his wife's nearby grave. Mr Kernan and others put on their hats. Mr Kernan praises the ""Irish church"" service over the one they just witnessed. Bloom reflects on the futility of resurrection.

Corny Kelleher joins them. John Henry Menton asks who Bloom is. Ned Lambert identifies him as the husband of ""Madame Marion Tweedy... the soprano."" Menton recalls dancing with Molly years ago and asks what Bloom does, disparaging him as a ""traveller for blottingpaper."" He questions why Molly married ""a coon like that.""

John O'Connell, the caretaker, greets them. He tells a joke about two drunks searching for a grave. Bloom muses on the cemetery and his own ad. The gravediggers lower Dignam's coffin. Bloom counts the mourners, noting a ""chap in the macintosh"" makes thirteen. He reflects on his own mortality and the short memory of the living.

Clay is flung onto the coffin. Bloom turns away, then reflects on a ""man in the macintosh."" Hynes asks Bloom for his full name and to add M’Coy's name to the list. Bloom provides ""Leopold"" and agrees. Hynes asks about the man in the macintosh.

They walk past O'Connell's grave. Mr Power speculates that Parnell is not in his grave. Hynes affirms Parnell is dead. Bloom reflects on spending money on charity for the living. He thinks of cremation and the ""smell of grilled beefsteaks to the starving.""

Bloom sees a rat. He thinks of corpses and their decay. He reflects on the ""love that kills"" and the idea of ghosts. He resolves to ""feel live warm beings."" Martin Cunningham approaches, talking gravely. John Henry Menton's hat is crushed. Bloom points it out. Menton, annoyed, fixes it. Bloom feels ""chapfallen."" He thinks ""How grand we are this morning!""

**Part III: Afternoon and Evening**

**Chapter 7: Bloom at the Newspaper Office**
Trams clatter through Dublin. Bloom passes shoeblacks, mail cars, and draymen rolling barrels. He meets Red Murray at the newspaper office, who has clipped his Alexander Keyes advertisement. Bloom intends to take it to the _Telegraph_. Red Murray offers to write a supporting paragraph. William Brayden, a prominent figure, enters, whom Red Murray compares to ""Our Saviour"" and Bloom to ""Mario"" the tenor. The Archbishop's office has called twice.

Bloom enters the printing works, observing the clanking machines and the typesetters. He finds Nannetti, the foreman, and asks him to revise Keyes's advertisement to include two crossed keys and the phrase ""House of Keys,"" a pun on the Manx parliament and an allusion to home rule. Nannetti agrees to implement the design if Keyes renews the ad for three months. Bloom reflects on the spelling and the noisy environment.

He passes old Monks, the dayfather, and reflects on his life. He watches a typesetter, thinking of his father's Hagadah book and the ""Angel of Death"" story, which he interprets as ""everybody eating everyone else."" He plans to phone Nannetti about the ad.

Leaving the printing works, Bloom hears laughter from the _Evening Telegraph_ office. Ned Lambert, Professor MacHugh, and Simon Dedalus are there, discussing a flowery passage from a newspaper. MacHugh dismisses it as ""bombast."" Myles Crawford, the editor, enters, shouting. Dedalus and Lambert leave for a drink.

Bloom uses the telephone to inquire about an auction. Lenehan, a journalist, enters with racing news, asking who wants a ""dead cert"" for the Gold Cup. Newsboys rush in, shouting headlines. Bloom bumps into Lenehan, apologizes. Lenehan complains of a knee injury.

Bloom tells them he's going to Dillon's to fix Keyes's ad. Crawford, with a dramatic gesture, tells him to ""Begone!"" Bloom leaves. Lenehan caricatures Bloom. The others discuss the Roman Empire and ""cloacal obsession."" Stephen Dedalus and Mr O'Madden Burke enter.

Stephen presents Mr Deasy's letter about foot-and-mouth disease. Crawford recognizes Deasy and recalls his ""bloodiest old tartar"" wife. Stephen asks if Deasy is a widower. J.J. O'Molloy and MacHugh discuss ""lost causes"" and the Greek spirit. Lenehan recites a limerick.

Crawford pushes Deasy's letter into his pocket, saying it will be fine. Lenehan asks his riddle: ""What opera resembles a railwayline?"" The answer is ""The Rose of Castile."" Crawford asks Stephen to write something with ""a bite in it,"" like Ignatius Gallaher, recounting Gallaher's journalism on the Phoenix Park murders. Crawford receives a phone call from Bloom, telling him to ""go to hell.""

J.J. O'Molloy speaks of the hawkers selling postcards of the Invincibles. Crawford disparages the modern legal and press professions. Stephen reflects on ""Mouth, south"" and the nature of love. J.J. O'Molloy argues for contemporary figures. Stephen, in turn, elaborates on Shakespeare's supposed personal themes in his plays, linking them to his family and the ""false or the usurping or the adulterous brother"" motif. He concludes that Shakespeare is ""the ghost and the prince.""

Mulligan enters, calls Stephen's theory a ""gaseous vertebrate,"" and reads Stephen's telegram aloud: ""The sentimentalist is he who would enjoy without incurring the immense debtorship for a thing done."" Mulligan mocks Stephen for being broke and claims ""the tramper Synge"" is looking to murder him. Mulligan then praises Aphrodite and refers to Bloom as ""the wandering jew"" who ""knows your old fellow.""

Stephen continues his discourse on Shakespeare, linking him to various literary and historical figures and discussing fidelity. Eglinton brings up Shakespeare's will, particularly the ""secondbest bed."" Stephen argues that Shakespeare, a ""rich country gentleman,"" would not have left his wife his second-best bed if he loved her. The discussion delves into the sexual and financial aspects of Shakespeare's life, with Stephen suggesting Shakespeare was a ""cornjobber and moneylender."" Mulligan humorously connects Stephen's theory to pederasty.

Mulligan proclaims ""_Eureka!_"" claiming he has a play in his head. Stephen elaborates on Shakespeare's family and the names of villains in his plays. Stephen then states that paternity is a ""mystical estate,"" and ""Amor matris... may be the only true thing in life."" He speaks of the ""bodily shame"" between father and son. Mulligan, delighted, announces his play, _Everyman His Own Wife_, and names its characters including ""Fresh Nelly"" and ""Rosalie (the coalquay whore)."" Mulligan then leaves, whispering to Haines that Bloom ""looked upon you to lust after you.""

Stephen and others leave the library. Stephen describes his ""vision"" of two Dublin women climbing Nelson's Pillar to see the city. Myles Crawford catches up to Bloom and dismissively tells him that Keyes can ""kiss my arse"" regarding his advertisement. Stephen continues his ""Parable of the Plums."" MacHugh praises it.

**Chapter 8: Leopold Bloom Walking and Eating Lunch**
Bloom walks through the city. He receives a religious throwaway. He sees Dilly Dedalus outside an auction room, and reflects on home life without a mother. On O'Connell Bridge, he feeds gulls with Banbury cakes. He notices an advertisement for ""Kino’s 11/- Trousers"" on a rowboat. He recalls ""metempsychosis."" He thinks of his secret correspondent, Martha Clifford, and her letter.

He sees sandwichmen advertising ""H.E.L.Y.’S"" and reflects on advertising strategies. He meets Mrs Breen, who informs him that her husband, Denis, is pursuing a libel action over a postcard with ""U.p: up"" on it. Bloom feels sorry for Mrs Mina Purefoy, who is having a difficult childbirth in the hospital. He also observes Cashel Boyle O’Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, a peculiar man who walks outside lampposts.

Bloom enters a restaurant, but the sight and smell of men eating noisily repulses him, so he leaves. He goes to Davy Byrne's pub for a quieter lunch. He orders a cheese sandwich and a glass of burgundy. He meets Nosey Flynn, who mentions Blazes Boylan is organizing Molly's concert tour. This news gives Bloom a ""warm shock.""

Flynn and Davy Byrne discuss horse racing. Bloom eats his sandwich, savoring the wine, and his mind wanders to oysters, tainted game, and the Howth head picnic with Molly. He goes to the yard to relieve himself. Flynn and Byrne discuss Bloom, noting he's in mourning and a Freemason, and speculate about his ""pimping."" Paddy Leonard and Bantam Lyons enter. Lyons, following a ""tip"" he believes came from Bloom, is betting on ""Sceptre."" Bloom leaves just as Lyons reveals the ""tip"" came from him.

Bloom walks towards Dawson Street, reflecting on his letters and his need for a dentist. He helps a blind stripling cross the street, observing his heightened senses. He thinks about the injustice of people born with disabilities. He sees Sir Frederick Falkiner, a judge, and recalls the Mirus Bazaar.

He sees a man who appears to be Boylan, and to avoid him, he swerves towards the National Museum. He then sees the man again near the museum gate and feels a ""flutter of his breath."" He distractedly looks at his ""Agendath Netaim"" prospectus, then finds his lemon soap in his hip pocket, feeling ""Safe!""

**Chapter 9: Stephen Dedalus at the National Library**
Stephen engages in a literary and philosophical discussion at the National Library with John Eglinton, Russell (A.E.), and Mr Best. The Quaker librarian, Mr Lyster, briefly joins. Stephen dismisses academic debates about Shakespeare's identity. Russell emphasizes art's role in revealing ""formless spiritual essences.""

Stephen asserts that Shakespeare, a ""butcher's son,"" portrayed murder vividly. He argues that the ghost in Hamlet is Shakespeare himself, addressing his dead son Hamnet. He provocatively suggests that Shakespeare's mother, Ann Hathaway, was the ""guilty queen."" Russell objects to this ""prying into the family life."" Stephen retorts that for writers, ""living our servants can do that for us."" He reflects on a debt he owes.

Eglinton challenges Stephen's interpretation of Ann Hathaway's fidelity. Stephen argues that Shakespeare’s will, which left her his ""secondbest bed,"" implies infidelity. The discussion continues about the nature of genius, with Stephen claiming ""A man of genius makes no mistakes.""

Mulligan enters, laughing and brandishing a telegram from Stephen. He mocks Stephen’s ""sentimentalist"" philosophy and his current financial state, calling him a ""priestified Kinchite."" He warns Stephen that ""the tramper Synge"" wants to murder him. Mulligan then boasts about finding ""Jehovah, collector of prepuces"" (Bloom) in the museum.

Stephen continues his argument about Shakespeare, linking him to promiscuity and ""scortatory love,"" citing historical anecdotes like the one about Dick Burbage. He claims Shakespeare’s dramatic themes, such as the ""usurping or the adulterous brother,"" reflect his personal life and ""original sin."" Eglinton suggests ""the truth is midway.""

Mulligan, exclaiming ""_Eureka!_"" announces his own play, _Everyman His Own Wife_. He then reveals the contents of Stephen's telegram, which states Stephen's belief that ""The sentimentalist is he who would enjoy without incurring the immense debtorship for a thing done."" Mulligan continues to tease Stephen about being broke and his supposed ""gonorrheal ladies.""

Stephen declares that paternity is ""a mystical estate,"" founded on the ""void,"" and that ""Amor matris... may be the only true thing in life."" He links Shakespeare's family members to characters in his plays. The discussion becomes increasingly chaotic and academic, with references to various philosophers and historical figures.

Mulligan calls Bloom ""the sheeny"" and ""Greeker than the Greeks."" He continues to ridicule Stephen's theories. Stephen defends himself, but eventually, the group decides to go for a drink at Mooney's. Stephen exits, followed by Mulligan, who whispers that Bloom is the ""wandering jew"" who looks ""to lust after you.""

**Chapter 10: Wandering Rocks**
This chapter presents a series of vignettes across Dublin, showing various characters and their movements, often intersecting or narrowly missing each other, at approximately the same time.

Father John Conmee, S.J., walks through the city, blessing a one-legged sailor, greeting Mrs Sheehy, and giving a letter to a schoolboy to post. He reflects on faith, charity, and the souls of men. He boards a tram, observing passengers and thinking of his spiritual duties and past. He alights near Howth, contemplating local history and an illicit affair.

Corny Kelleher, an undertaker, is in his office, looking at a coffin and chatting with a constable.

Tom Rochford demonstrates his invention of a ""Turn Now On"" indicator. Lenehan reveals Tom Rochford's heroic rescue of a man from a manhole. Lenehan also mentions that Bloom bet on the horse ""Throwaway.""

Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam, carrying porksteaks, wanders through Wicklow Street, thinking of his deceased father and his family. He sees posters and reflects on his father's death.

The Viceregal cavalcade, carrying the Earl of Dudley, the Lord Lieutenant, and his entourage, processes through Dublin. Many characters observe them: Mr Dudley White, Richie Goulding, John Wyse Nolan, Lenehan, M’Coy, Gerty MacDowell, and Stephen Dedalus (who passed earlier). Blazes Boylan, forgetting to salute, offers a red carnation to the ladies. The procession passes Bloom’s house. A pedestrian in a brown macintosh, eating dry bread, crosses the Viceroy's path ""unscathed.""

**Chapter 11: Sirens (at the Ormond Hotel)**
The hoofbeats of the Viceregal cavalcade are heard by Miss Douce (bronze) and Miss Kennedy (gold), two barmaids at the Ormond Hotel. They flirt and comment on the passing procession, particularly noticing Blazes Boylan. Bloom, walking by, reflects on his secret letter from Martha and the ""sweets of sin.""

Inside the Ormond bar, Pat, the waiter, serves tea. Miss Douce and Miss Kennedy continue to chat, complaining about a young brat (Pat) and discussing suntans and skin care. They recall an ""old wretch"" from the Antient Concert Rooms. The barmaids laugh about Bloom, calling him ""greasy eyes"" and ""greaseabloom.""

Simon Dedalus enters, greets Miss Douce, and flirts with her. He orders whisky and water. Miss Douce sings ""_O, Idolores, queen of the eastern seas!_"" Lenehan enters, asking if Boylan was looking for him. Miss Kennedy says no. Lenehan attempts to flirt with Miss Kennedy, reading a fable, but she ignores him.

Lenehan greets Mr Dedalus, calling Stephen ""the youthful bard."" Mr Dedalus acknowledges this. Lenehan claims to have drunk with Stephen and other literati earlier. Mr Dedalus notices the piano has been moved and learns the tuner was blind. Miss Douce expresses pity for him.

Bloom passes by outside, observing a mermaid poster. He spots Boylan on a jaunting car, heading for the Ormond. Bloom is filled with trepidation. He enters the dining room of the Ormond and sits at a table with Richie Goulding.

Blazes Boylan enters the bar, orders drinks, and asks about horse racing results. He mentions he bet money on ""Sceptre"" for a friend. Miss Douce flirts with him, then makes change at the cash register, marking it four o'clock. Lenehan draws Boylan's attention to the time.

Ben Dollard and Father Cowley enter the saloon. Mr Dedalus and Father Cowley persuade Ben Dollard to sing ""_When love absorbs my ardent soul_."" Bloom, in the dining room, observes this from a distance, reflecting on Molly, Boylan, and the song.

Bloom eats liver slices and mashed potatoes with Richie Goulding. He reflects on his own and Richie's eating habits and the clean dining room. The harp music from the saloon drifts in. Mr Dedalus declines to sing. Father Cowley persuades him. Simon Dedalus begins to sing ""_M’appari_."" Bloom and Richie are deeply moved by the performance, recalling Molly and their past.

Bloom reflects on love, loss, and the ephemeral nature of life, thinking of his dead son Rudy. He unwinds and then snaps an elastic band. He decides to write a letter to Martha Clifford, enclosing a postal order, and addresses the envelope. He thinks of the horse race results and his encounter with Bantam Lyons.

Miss Douce shows George Lidwell a seahorn, making him hear the waves. She implies she has a ""gentleman friend."" Bob Cowley plays light music. Ben Dollard is urged to sing ""The Croppy Boy."" Bloom contemplates his finances and the upcoming meeting at Barney Kiernan's.

Ben Dollard sings with a ""base barreltone"" voice, confessing his sins in Latin. Bloom listens, thinking of corpses and his own sense of guilt. He reflects on his lack of a son and his current loneliness. He observes Miss Douce and Miss Kennedy.

The music grows mournful as Dollard sings of the croppy boy's father and brothers falling in battle. Bloom connects this to his own sense of being the ""last of my race."" He thinks of Milly and Rudy. He then looks up, feeling unblessed, and decides to leave.

The barmaids continue to flirt. Bloom, planning his exit, sees his name on a newspaper. He decides to write his letter to Martha now. He writes a short, personal note, adding a postscript about being lonely. He blots and addresses it.

He walks towards the post office. A hackney car passes with Blazes Boylan, who is cheerful. Richie Goulding asks Bloom if he's ""Answering an ad?"" Bloom says he’s a ""Town traveller.""

Bloom thinks about the sad minor key of the music. He blotted the letter. He decides to go to Barney Kiernan's.

Bald Pat, the waiter, mitres napkins. Miss Douce shows Lidwell the seahorn. Lidwell asks what the ""wild waves"" are saying. Lydia smiles.

Ben Dollard sings. Bloom reflects on music and noise. He considers women's voices and physical attributes. Boylan's shoes creak outside. Bloom thinks of the ""dirty whore"" he passed earlier. He looks at an antique shop window.

The Ormond group lifts their glasses. A blind stripling enters the bar, but he doesn't see. Bloom watches him, reflecting on his physical challenges. Bloom thinks of his epitaph.

**Chapter 12: Cyclops (in Barney Kiernan's Pub)**
The narrator, a debt collector, meets Joe Hynes. They discuss a chimneysweep and a Jewish merchant who owes money. They decide to go to Barney Kiernan’s pub to find ""the citizen."" The narrator describes the citizen as a fierce Irish nationalist, accompanied by a vicious dog, Garryowen.

Inside, the citizen, smoking and surrounded by papers, discusses foreign wars and Russian tyranny. Joe orders three pints. The citizen nearly throttles Garryowen. A long, heroic, and exaggerated description of the citizen is given, referencing ancient Irish heroes and historical figures.

Terry brings the pints, and Joe pays with a sovereign, surprising the narrator. The narrator mentions seeing Bloom earlier. A heroic description of Bloom follows. The citizen reads out English birth and death notices from the _Irish Independent_, mocking it.

Alf Bergan and Bob Doran (drunk) arrive. Alf reveals that Denis Breen is suing for libel over a postcard with ""U. p: up"" on it. The citizen's dog growls. Alf explains Breen's legal pursuit and his search for a G-man.

The conversation turns to capital punishment. Bloom offers a scientific explanation for a hanged man's erection, presented in highly verbose, academic language. The citizen, an Irish nationalist, rants about the Invincibles and ""new Ireland."" Bob Doran tries to get Garryowen to ""give the paw."" Bloom and the citizen argue about Irish history and figures like Robert Emmet.

The narrator gives an elaborate, fantastical account of Paddy Dignam's funeral, featuring thousands of mourners, singing by Lenehan and Mulligan, a hangman, and an Oxford graduate proposing to the bride.

The citizen discusses the Irish language and criticizes ""shoneens"" (Anglicized Irishmen). Lenehan uses some French. The citizen drinks to the ""undoing of his foes."" Lenehan announces that ""Throwaway"" won the Gold Cup at twenty to one, confirming Boylan lost money on ""Sceptre.""

The citizen, Joe, and J.J. O'Molloy argue about Irish trade and the ""reforestation"" of Ireland. A detailed description of a ""fashionable international wedding"" for Jean Wyse de Neaulan and Miss Fir Conifer is given, complete with tree-themed attendees.

The citizen rants about the British navy and corporal punishment. He describes a young lad being flogged. John Wyse Nolan quotes Shakespeare. The citizen contrasts this with ""greater Ireland beyond the sea."" Joe and J.J. discuss the French and Germans. The narrator mockingly describes old Queen Victoria's drunkenness.

The citizen asks Bloom about his ""nation."" Bloom replies, ""Ireland. I was born here. Ireland."" The citizen spits a ""Red bank oyster."" Joe offers him an ""ancient Irish facecloth."" A long, detailed, and exaggerated description of the facecloth's embroidered symbols and scenes of Ireland is provided.

Bloom states he belongs to a ""race... hated and persecuted,"" and speaks of ""injustice."" John Wyse suggests ""force."" Bloom argues against hatred and says, ""Love... I mean the opposite of hatred."" He leaves abruptly to find Martin Cunningham.

The citizen calls Bloom ""A new apostle to the gentiles. Universal love,"" then immediately calls him a ""pimp"" and a ""pattern of a Romeo and Juliet."" A list of various ""love"" relationships is given. The citizen rants about Cromwell and the English.

Lenehan reveals Bloom bet on ""Throwaway."" The narrator goes to the back to urinate, thinking about Bloom's cunning. He returns to find John Wyse Nolan claiming Bloom gave Sinn Fein ideas to Griffith. The narrator denounces Bloom and his father for ""perpetrating frauds.""

Martin Cunningham and Jack Power arrive in a car. A fantastic, medieval description of their arrival and ordering of food is given. Martin asks where Bloom is. Lenehan says ""Defrauding widows and orphans."" The citizen calls Bloom a ""perverted jew from Hungary."" Jack Power asks if he's Bloom the dentist's cousin. Martin clarifies his father's name was Virag, who poisoned himself. The citizen calls Bloom ""the new Messiah for Ireland!""

The citizen calls Bloom ""A wolf in sheep’s clothing. Virag from Hungary! Ahasuerus I call him."" A long, fantastical description of a procession of religious figures, saints, and martyrs blessing Barney Kiernan's pub unfolds.

Bloom returns, saying he was at the courthouse. The narrator and others mock his supposed wealth and secret betting. The citizen tells him not to tell anyone. Martin Cunningham quickly gets his companions into a jaunting car. The citizen yells ""Three cheers for Israel!"" He then curses, calling Jesus a Jew. The citizen, enraged, grabs a biscuit box, intending to ""brain that bloody jewman.""

An exaggerated, almost apocalyptic description of Bloom's departure from Dublin ensues, with a grand ceremony and bonfires. As the ""mastodontic pleasureship"" sails away, an earthquake of ""terrific and instantaneous"" effect occurs. Amid the chaos, Bloom is seen ascending to heaven like ""ben Bloom Elijah.""

**Chapter 13: Nausicaa (Gerty MacDowell on Sandymount Strand)**
The summer evening begins. Three young women, Cissy Caffrey, Edy Boardman, and Gerty MacDowell, are on Sandymount Strand with two twin boys (Tommy and Jacky Caffrey) and a baby (Boardman). The children play. Tommy and Jacky quarrel over a sandcastle, which gets destroyed. Cissy scolds them.

Gerty, lost in thought, is described in great detail: her beauty, her health remedies, her ""innate refinement,"" and her ""gnawing sorrow."" She dreams of a ""manly man"" as a husband, reflecting on her unrequited love for Reggy Wylie. She envisions her ideal domestic life with children.

The twins quarrel again, kicking their ball towards the sea. A gentleman in black (Bloom) is sitting nearby. He gallantly intercepts the ball. When he throws it back, it rolls under Gerty's skirt. Cissy tells Gerty to kick it. Gerty, after a missed attempt, deliberately lifts her skirt slightly and kicks the ball far. She feels a ""warm flush"" and exchanges a significant glance with the gentleman, whose face appears ""saddest she had ever seen.""

The sound of an organ from a nearby church (a temperance retreat) fills the air. Gerty's thoughts turn to her father's drinking, domestic violence, and her role as a ""sterling good daughter."" She recalls her mother’s headaches and her own attempts to be helpful.

The twins resume quarreling. Cissy and Edy call them back, fearing the tide. Cissy runs past Bloom, overtly showing her legs. Gerty thinks of Cissy's brazenness. The church choir sings. Gerty is aware of Bloom's gaze fixed on her ""transparent"" stockings.

Gerty, removing her hat, feels the ""swift answering flash of admiration"" in Bloom's eyes. She feels a ""burning scarlet"" sweep over her. Edy notices and, with a ""squinting"" look, asks Gerty for her thoughts. Gerty replies she was wondering if it was late. Cissy goes to ask Bloom for the time. Bloom, nervous, says his watch is stopped but he thinks it's after eight. Cissy returns, saying ""uncle"" said his ""waterworks were out of order.""

The choir sings again. Gerty notices Bloom winding his watch and continually looking at her. She feels an ""irritation against her stays"" and knows ""that thing must be coming on"" (her period). She believes Bloom is ""literally worshipping at her shrine.""

Edy and Cissy prepare to leave. Gerty, stung by Edy's taunt about her ""best boy,"" defiantly declares she can ""throw my cap at who I like because it’s leap year."" Cissy tidies the children. Baby Boardman wets his bib. Gerty thinks of the ""benediction"" as the church bell rings.

A bat flies from the belfry. Gerty sees the lighthouse lights and reflects on her secret dreams of love and her physical ""shortcoming"" (lameness). She decides she will make ""the great sacrifice"" for love. The fireworks begin. Gerty stays, observing Bloom's ""whitehot passion."" She leans back, revealing her ""graceful beautifully shaped legs."" She feels his ""panting heart.""

Another rocket bursts, revealing her ""nainsook knickers."" She is not ashamed. Bloom is ""looking, looking."" A final rocket bursts, shedding ""rain gold hair threads"" and ""greeny dewy stars."" Gerty gives Bloom a ""pathetic little glance."" Bloom feels like a ""brute."" Their ""souls met in a last lingering glance."" Gerty waves a wadding from her pocket and then limps away, confirming her lameness for Bloom.

Bloom watches Gerty limp away, realizing ""That’s why she’s left on the shelf."" He finds her a ""hot little devil"" despite her lameness. He reflects on women's natural cravings, his letter to Martha, and his own sexual desires. He feels a ""warm human plumpness"" and a ""perfume of embraces."" He senses Molly's presence. He smells his own armpit, detecting the scent of lemon soap.

He thinks about the unpaid soap and lotion. He reflects on his ""Mystery Man on the Beach"" idea and the ""unseen"" presence of a ""man in the brown macintosh."" He senses the ""cold of interstellar space."" He recalls kissing Molly at Howth. He feels tired and wonders if he should go home. He thinks of ""Rip van Winkle."" A bat flies. The clock in the priest's house coos ""Cuckoo.""

**Chapter 14: Oxen of the Sun (National Maternity Hospital)**
The narrative shifts into a complex, evolving prose style, mimicking historical English literature, as Leopold Bloom visits the National Maternity Hospital in Holles Street, where Mrs Mina Purefoy is in prolonged labor.

The chapter opens with a preamble on procreation and the Celtic reverence for medicine. Bloom, the ""man that wayfaring was,"" stands by the hospital door. Nurse Callan, the ""nursingwoman,"" admits him. Bloom, who is in mourning, asks about Dr. O’Hare, but is told he died of ""bellycrab."" The nurse informs Bloom that Mrs Purefoy has been in labor for three days.

Stephen Dedalus and other medical students (Dixon, Lynch, Madden, Crotthers, Costello, Lenehan) are gathered in the common room, which is described as an enchanted ""castle"" with strange food and drink. Dixon offers Bloom a drink, which Bloom discreetly pours away. Nurse Quigley interrupts, reminding them of the woman in labor.

The students engage in a discussion about birth, death, and morality, with Stephen lamenting the ""Godpossibled souls that we nightly impossibilise."" Stephen speaks of the ""mysteries of generation"" and the theories of Averroes and Moses Maimonides. He then quotes, ""he who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the Lord."" Bloom, though outwardly participating, is inwardly sorrowful, remembering his own dead son, Rudy, and Stephen's dissolute life.

Stephen refills the cups, speaking of ""time’s ruins build eternity’s mansions"" and ""in woman’s womb word is made flesh."" He introduces controversial theological ideas about consubstantiality. Costello attempts to sing a bawdy song, but Nurse Quigley rebukes them for their ""gasteful turmoil"" given Mrs Purefoy's labor.

Dixon asks Stephen why he hasn't taken friar's vows. Lenehan mocks Stephen, accusing him of deflowering a woman. Stephen insists he is ""the eternal son and ever virgin."" The students tease Stephen about ""his curious rite of wedlock."" Stephen then recounts a legend about an ""Irish bull in an English chinashop.""

Mulligan enters with Alec Bannon, and expounds his project for a ""national fertilising farm"" called ""Omphalos"" on Lambay Island, where he proposes to offer his services for ""fecundation."" He is soaked by rain. Mulligan's project is favorably received.

A bell rings, and Nurse Callan announces that Mrs Purefoy has given birth to ""a bouncing boy."" Dixon, the young surgeon, defends his profession. Bloom reflects on the students' ""impudent mocks"" and his relief at the safe delivery. He inwardly praises Theodore Purefoy, the father, for his prolific procreation.

The students are excited by the birth. Malachias (Mulligan) tells a horror story: Haines appears, claiming to be the murderer of Samuel Childs, whose ghost (the black panther) stalks him. Haines vanishes, reappears to announce a meeting place. The mystery is ""unveiled"": Haines is the third brother, Childs, who drinks drugs to forget.

The narrative shifts to Bloom's inner transformation, remembering his younger self and a past encounter with a prostitute, Bridie Kelly. He contemplates the ""equine portent"" in the sky, now identified as ""the everlasting bride, Martha, Millicent, the young, the dear, the radiant.""

Stephen, reminded of the past, calls himself ""Bous Stephanoumenos, bullockbefriending bard."" Lenehan describes a horse race where Sceptre lost to Throwaway, which Bloom had accidentally tipped Bantam Lyons to bet on. Vincent describes his ""queen"" and a meeting with Father Conmee.

The perspective returns to Bloom, who was merely staring at a bottle of Bass beer, recalling private transactions. The debate in the common room is described as ""an epitome of the course of life,"" with students discussing various theories related to obstetrics, mortality, and sex. A critique of Bloom's ""perverted transcendentalism"" is presented.

The news of the happy birth is delivered. Bloom recalls a childhood scene with Molly and a young boy (Rudy). Stephen, provoked by the boisterous celebration, smashes the chandelier with his ashplant, crying ""Non serviam!"" The room plunges into darkness.

Chaos erupts. Bella Cohen, the madam of the brothel, appears, demanding payment for the broken lamp. Bloom, recovering Stephen's ashplant, offers a shilling. The police are called. The ""hue and cry"" of many Dubliners from earlier in the day pursue Bloom and Stephen.

Private Carr strikes Stephen in the face. Stephen falls, stunned. Bloom picks up Stephen's hat. Major Tweedy calls for ""Cease fire!"" Paddy Dignam's ghost appears, speaking of ""metempsychosis."" John O'Connell and Father Coffey appear. Paddy Dignam descends into a coalhole, followed by a rat. Tom Rochford leaps after him.

Bloom and Stephen enter Bella Cohen’s brothel. Zoe Higgins, a whore, accosts Bloom, offering services. She finds a potato (Bloom's talisman) in his pocket and takes it. Molly appears as a vision, mocking Bloom's ""cold feet."" Bloom's father, Rudolph, appears as a ghost, reproaching him. Bloom's mother, Ellen, appears as a pantomime dame.

Gerty MacDowell appears, accusing Bloom. Mrs Breen accuses Bloom of being in ""haunts of sin."" The Bohee brothers perform. Bloom performs a magic trick. Edward the Seventh, as ""Joking Jesus,"" appears. The Citizen, the Croppy Boy, and Rumbold (the hangman) appear, accusing and executing Bloom. Bloom dies, then is resurrected as a ""new Bloomusalem"" and a Messiah figure, distributing gifts.

Bloom becomes ""mute, shrunken, carbonised."" He is then seen as an emigrant, mournfully planning his death. Zoe mocks him. Bloom bitterly says ""Man and woman, love, what is it? A cork and bottle."" Zoe asks him for cash. He smiles, ""More, houri, more."" Zoe leads him to the musicroom, promising to peel off her clothes. Bloom hesitates, thinking of Molly.

Stephen, at the pianola, makes philosophical remarks about music and knowledge. Virag, Bloom’s grandfather, descends through the chimney, lecturing Bloom on female anatomy and promiscuity. Henry Flower, Bloom’s alter ego, plays a dulcimer. Stephen smashes the chandelier, crying ""Non serviam!""

Stephen flees. Bella Cohen demands payment. Bloom pays, grabs Stephen's ashplant. He is pursued by a fantastic ""hue and cry"" of all the characters he encountered throughout the day. Private Carr strikes Stephen. Stephen falls, unconscious. Bloom picks up his hat. Corny Kelleher arrives, reassures the police, and offers Bloom a lift home. Bloom decides to wait with Stephen. Stephen murmurs poetry. Bloom recognizes his mother's face in Stephen's. Rudy appears, unseeing.

**Chapter 16: Eumeus (Cabman's Shelter)**
Bloom brushes shavings from Stephen, who is dazed, and leads him towards a cabman's shelter near Butt Bridge for a drink. Bloom notices his trousers button is missing. They pass a stationary cab and a sandstrewer. Bloom recalls his close call with the sandstrewer earlier in the day. Stephen thinks of Ibsen, and Bloom smells the bakery.

Bloom, sober, warns Stephen about the dangers of Nighttown and ""women of ill fame,"" criticizing Stephen's drinking habits and the desertion by his ""pubhunting confrères."" Stephen responds, ""And that one was Judas,"" referring to Mulligan. They pass the Customhouse. Stephen spots Gumley, his father's friend, now a corporation watchman, and avoids him.

Corley, a dissolute acquaintance, accosts Stephen, begging for money for lodgings. Stephen, despite knowing Corley is likely lying, gives him a halfcrown. Corley asks Stephen to ask Boylan for a job. Bloom, who has been observing from a distance, recognizes Corley as a ""parasite"" and notes Stephen's gullibility. He expresses concern about Stephen's lack of ""making both ends meet.""

Bloom asks Stephen how much he gave Corley. Stephen says ""Half a crown."" Bloom asks Stephen where he will sleep, recalling the incident at Westland Row. Stephen replies, ""To seek misfortune."" Bloom mentions meeting Stephen's father and subtly suggests Stephen go home. Stephen thinks of his impoverished family. Bloom cautions Stephen against Mulligan, calling him a ""guide, philosopher and friend"" who is ""picking your brains.""

They enter the cabman's shelter. Bloom orders coffee and a bun for Stephen. A red-bearded sailor (D.B. Murphy) stares at Stephen. Bloom remarks on Italian as a ""beautiful language."" Stephen, tired, responds that the men were ""haggling over money."" The sailor asks Stephen's name. Stephen, ignoring Bloom's subtle warning, says ""Dedalus."" The sailor recognizes the name, claiming he saw Simon Dedalus shoot eggs off bottles years ago.

The sailor, D.B. Murphy, states he's from Queenstown Harbour and hasn't seen his wife in seven years. Bloom imagines his homecoming. The sailor shows his discharge papers and describes his extensive travels, including being chased by pirates and seeing ""maneaters in Peru."" He shows a postcard of savage women. He asks how to keep them off, saying ""Glass.""

Bloom examines the postcard, linking it to his own travel aspirations and his secret plan for Molly's concert tour. The sailor recounts a Chinese man with magical pills and a man killed in Trieste with a knife. Bloom and Stephen exchange glances as the keeper (Skin-the-Goat Fitzharris) is observed.

The sailor asks for his papers back. Bloom asks if he's seen Gibraltar. The sailor expresses weariness of the sea. Bloom reflects on the vastness of the ocean and the dangers of seafaring. The sailor talks of a fellow who became a valet, leaving him clothes. He also mentions his son, Danny, who ran off to sea. The sailor reveals his tattooed chest, an anchor and the figure ""16"" with a frowning face, done by a Greek named Antonio.

A streetwalker peers in. Bloom is flustered and distracted, recognizing her from Ormond Quay. He reflects on his own wife's undergarments. The keeper makes a rude sign, dismissing the streetwalker. Bloom comments on the ""scandal"" of unlicensed prostitutes. Stephen, indifferent, remarks they ""sell much more than she ever had."" Bloom asks Stephen if he believes in the soul. Stephen says it's a ""simple substance and therefore incorruptible."" Bloom, a skeptic, argues that the Bible is full of ""forgeries.""

Bloom offers Stephen coffee and a bun, but Stephen refuses the bun and asks Bloom to take away a knife, as it reminds him of Roman history. Bloom notes the sailor's stories and his own skepticism. He then thinks about the sailor's shady character, potentially a murderer or a bluffing mariner.

Bloom returns to the topic of women in the city, then connects his wife's Spanish heritage to ""hot passion."" Stephen mentions the previous altercation over ten shillings. Bloom praises Grecian statues and criticizes women's poor dress sense.

The conversation drifts to maritime accidents. The sailor recounts surviving perils with a pious medal. They discuss a wreck off Daunt’s Rock. The sailor leaves to urinate, taking a swig of rum. Bloom observes him, thinking of Gumley, the watchman, who is sleeping.

The men lament the decline of Irish shipping. The keeper attributes wrecks to ""palmoil"" bribes from the British government. The sailor returns, singing a chanty, and launches into a tirade against England and her crimes, praising Ireland's resources. He predicts England's downfall and advises Irishmen to stay and work for Ireland. Bloom internally dismisses these claims as ""egregious balderdash.""

Bloom, now speaking to Stephen, recounts silencing the citizen by telling him Christ was a Jew. Stephen cryptically comments in Latin. Bloom stresses equality and mutual understanding, arguing against violence and intolerance. He whispers to Stephen that accusations against Jews are false, and that historically, England prospered when Jews were allowed in. He advocates for all creeds and classes to have a comfortable income.

Stephen, uninterested in work, says ""Count me out."" Bloom says he means ""work in the widest possible sense,"" including literary labor. Stephen retorts that Ireland is important because it ""belongs to me."" Bloom is perplexed by this. He reflects on the ""errors of notorieties"" and the ""natural genius"" of others.

Bloom reflects on writing his own ""Experiences in a Cabman’s Shelter."" He reads the newspaper, seeing ""L. Boom"" and ""Stephen Dedalus B.A."" mentioned in Dignam's obituary. He is pleased that Stephen's name is in the paper, despite the misprint of his own name. He realizes Lenehan's betting tip was false. He thinks of Parnell's ""return.""

Bloom shows Stephen a faded photo of Molly, in a low-cut evening dress, standing by a piano. He describes her as his wife, ""Madam Marion Tweedy, the _prima donna_,"" and praises her singing and figure. He compares her to Grecian statues, noting the photograph doesn’t do her justice because it's ""not art."" He considers leaving the photo for Stephen to admire.

Bloom reflects on the ""makebelieve"" of society and the ""eternal question of the life connubial."" He thinks of Parnell's fall, and his own minor injury at the time. He connects the events to his own life and Molly's Spanish heritage.

Bloom, wishing to leave, suggests Stephen come home with him for cocoa. He pays the fourpence for their drinks. As they leave, Bloom explains to Stephen why cafe chairs are placed upside down on tables (to sweep the floor). They walk arm-in-arm towards Eccles Street.

They talk of music. Bloom expresses his love for classical and sacred music, especially Molly's singing. He praises Stephen's father's singing of ""M'appari."" Stephen praises Dowland and other lutenists. A horse pulling a sweeper passes, and Bloom warns Stephen of the ""steamroller.""

Bloom looks at Stephen, finding him not the ""handsome blackguard type"" women usually desire, but still sees his potential. Stephen sings a German song. Bloom nods. Bloom thinks of Stephen's ""phenomenally beautiful tenor voice"" and his future success. He plans to advise Stephen to distance himself from Mulligan.

The horse mired. Bloom and Stephen pass through the chains. Stephen sings the end of a ballad. The driver watches them walk towards the railway bridge, thinking they are ""to be married by Father Maher.""

**Chapter 17: Ithaca (Bloom's Home)**
Bloom and Stephen walk back to Eccles Street, following parallel and diverging paths, discussing a wide range of topics: music, literature, Ireland, Dublin, Paris, women, prostitution, diet, religion, education, and Stephen's collapse. They find common"
