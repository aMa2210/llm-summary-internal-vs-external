A Doll_s House-Henrik Ibsen,"The play ""A Doll's House"" opens on Christmas Eve in the Helmers' comfortable home. Nora Helmer, in high spirits, arrives with Christmas parcels, secretly eating macaroons. Her husband, Torvald Helmer, addresses her with affectionate but demeaning pet names like ""little lark,"" ""little squirrel,"" and ""little spendthrift."" He is celebrating his new appointment as Bank Manager, which will bring financial security, but admonishes Nora about wasting money and his strict views on debt. Nora tries to get him to give her money as a Christmas gift, which she says she will save, but he doubts her ability to do so. He also playfully chastises her about his rule against eating macaroons.

The maid announces two visitors: Dr. Rank, a close family friend, and Mrs. Christine Linde, an old school friend of Nora's. Helmer goes into his study with Dr. Rank. Christine, looking tired and dejected, reveals she is a widow who has had a hard life, supporting her ailing mother and younger brothers. Now that her family is independent, she feels her life is ""unspeakably empty"" and has come to town seeking work, hoping Helmer can help her find a position at the bank.

Nora, eager to impress Christine, proudly reveals her ""great secret"": she saved Torvald's life years ago. Torvald had been desperately ill and needed to go to Italy to recover, a trip that cost two hundred and fifty pounds. He believed Nora's dying father provided the money, but Nora confesses she secretly borrowed the sum and forged her father's signature as security on the loan, dating it three days after his death, as he was too ill to sign. She kept this secret because Torvald, with his ""manly independence,"" would have found it humiliating to owe her. For years, she has secretly worked and saved every penny she could from her housekeeping allowance to pay off the debt, often imagining a rich admirer would die and leave her money to free her from her worries.

Their conversation is interrupted by the re-entry of Krogstad, a lawyer who has a subordinate position at the bank. Mrs. Linde reacts with visible distress, recognizing him from ""many years ago."" Dr. Rank, emerging from Helmer's study, describes Krogstad as having a ""diseased moral character"" and states that he holds some sort of appointment at the bank. Krogstad confronts Nora, revealing he knows she influenced Helmer to give Mrs. Linde his job. He demands Nora use her influence to ensure he keeps his position, threatening to expose her forgery. He explains that he needs to keep his job to regain his reputation for his sons' sake, having previously committed an ""indiscretion"" (forgery) that ruined his public standing. Nora initially tries to dismiss him, but Krogstad details the legal implications of her forgery, stating that the law ""cares nothing about motives."" He warns that if he loses his position, she will lose hers with him. Nora is left in terror, telling her children not to speak of the ""stranger man.""

Helmer returns and immediately senses Krogstad's presence. Nora lies, denying his visit, but Helmer saw Krogstad leaving. Helmer reprimands Nora for her involvement and her lie. Nora tries again to persuade Helmer to keep Krogstad, arguing he writes ""scurrilous newspapers"" and can cause harm, and that she is ""frightened to death of him."" Helmer refuses, citing Krogstad's moral failings, but primarily his ""tactless"" familiarity with him. He views Krogstad's presence as an intolerable social affront. Helmer immediately sends the maid to deliver a letter dismissing Krogstad. Nora, in despair, realizes it's too late. Helmer, misunderstanding her distress, embraces her and declares he will take ""everything upon myself"" to protect her, should any trouble arise. Nora is horrified by his statement, whispering that she hopes such a sacrifice will not be necessary. She worries about her children being ""depraved"" by her actions and decides to keep them away from her.

In Act II, Nora is consumed by anxiety, checking the letterbox repeatedly. She talks to her old nurse, Anne, asking if the children would forget their mother if she ""went away altogether,"" recalling that Anne had to give up her own child to work for Nora. Christine arrives to help mend Nora's Tarantella costume for a fancy-dress ball. Nora reveals Dr. Rank is dying from a hereditary spinal disease. Christine suspects Dr. Rank might be Nora's secret lender, but Nora denies it, stating Rank had no money then. She then reveals her intention to ""make an end of it"" with Krogstad. Christine realizes Nora is hiding something serious.

Helmer returns, and Nora desperately tries to distract him and again pleads for Krogstad's job, emphasizing the potential harm to Helmer's reputation. Helmer staunchly refuses, stating that Krogstad's familiarity with him is intolerable and that he has already dispatched the letter of dismissal. Nora is distraught. Dr. Rank then enters and privately reveals to Nora that he is dying from his illness and will soon send her a card with a black cross to signify his departure from life. He also confesses his love for Nora, implicitly offering to do anything for her. Nora is shocked and repulsed by his confession, unable to ask him for the ""tremendously big favour"" she had intended to request.

Shortly after, Krogstad arrives, having come through the back entrance. He confirms his dismissal and reveals he has placed a letter in Helmer's letterbox, detailing Nora's forgery. He states he will not expose her but will keep the bond to hold power over them, forcing Helmer to give him a higher position in the bank. Nora is in a state of extreme panic. Mrs. Linde, seeing the letter in the box, learns of Nora's forgery and offers to speak to Krogstad. Nora, desperate to delay Torvald from checking the mail, begs him to help her practice the Tarantella dance, demanding he opens no letters that night. She dances wildly, trying to consume his attention until after the ball. Christine then returns, having been unable to reach Krogstad, who was out of town but is expected back the next evening. Nora is left alone, calculating that she has ""thirty-one hours to live"" until her secret is revealed.

Act III begins with Christine waiting for Krogstad in the Helmers' living room after the ball. When Krogstad arrives, Christine reveals she truly cares for him and explains she left him years ago, not out of heartlessness, but out of necessity to support her family. Now that her family is provided for, she feels her life is empty and proposes they ""join forces,"" offering to be a mother to his children and to work for him. Krogstad is deeply moved and says he will try to clear his name, wanting to retrieve his letter from Helmer's letterbox. Christine, however, convinces him not to, arguing that Helmer and Nora's ""unhappy secret must be disclosed"" for their relationship to achieve ""a complete understanding"" without ""concealment and falsehood."" Krogstad agrees, saying he will wait for her downstairs.

Helmer and Nora return from the ball. Helmer is in a passionate mood, expressing his desire for Nora, fantasizing about her as his ""secretly promised bride."" Nora tries to keep him at a distance. Dr. Rank then appears, seemingly cheerful but hinting at his impending death, confirming he sent his ""leave-taking"" cards with black crosses. After Rank leaves, Helmer checks the letterbox, finding Rank's cards and Krogstad's letter. Nora tries desperately to stop him, but he reads it.

Helmer's reaction is one of furious condemnation. He calls Nora a ""hypocrite, a liar—worse, worse—a criminal,"" blaming her for ruining his happiness and future by putting him ""in the power of an unscrupulous man."" He fears public suspicion of his complicity and declares she has destroyed everything. He tells her she must remain in the house for appearance's sake, but he will not allow her to raise the children, as he cannot trust them. He states their happiness is over, and only appearances matter now.

Suddenly, the maid brings another letter for Nora. Helmer seizes it and reads it, bursting into joy. Krogstad, influenced by Christine, has sent back Nora's bond, expressing regret and repentance due to a ""happy change in his life."" Helmer immediately tears up both letters and the bond, burning them in the stove, declaring them ""saved!"" He dismisses Nora's actions as ""womanly helplessness"" born of love and promises to protect and guide her, treating her with ""doubly gentle care."" He reassures her that everything will return to normal and that he has completely forgiven her.

Nora, however, has changed into her everyday dress and asks Helmer to sit down for a serious conversation. She states that this is the first real conversation they've had in eight years of marriage. She reveals she has never been truly happy, feeling she has been treated like a ""doll-child"" by her father and a ""doll-wife"" by him, her home nothing but a ""playroom."" She declares he is not the man to educate her to be a proper wife and, echoing his earlier words, that she is not fit to raise the children. She announces she is leaving him immediately to ""stand quite alone"" and educate herself to understand herself and the world.

Helmer forbids her, calling her ""blind, foolish,"" and accusing her of neglecting her ""most sacred duties"" as a wife and mother. Nora counters that she has ""other duties just as sacred""—duties to herself. She no longer believes she is primarily a wife and mother but a ""reasonable human being"" who must learn to think for herself. She questions the law, finding it ""impossible to convince myself that the law is right"" when it condemns actions done out of love to save a father or husband.

Helmer then suggests she no longer loves him. Nora confirms, ""No, that is just it. I do not love you any more."" She explains that her realization came when the ""wonderful thing"" she had hoped for didn't happen. She had believed that when the truth of her forgery came out, he would ""come forward and take everything upon yourself, and say: I am the guilty one."" Instead, he was concerned only with his own reputation. She realizes he would never sacrifice his ""honour"" for her, and she has been living with a ""strange man"" for eight years.

Nora states she cannot be his wife as she is now. She takes off her wedding ring and gives it back to him, demanding her own, declaring they are both free from obligations. She states she will not see the children, believing they are in ""better hands."" She says goodbye, refusing any help or contact from him, and states that for their life together to be a ""real wedlock,"" they both would have to be so profoundly changed that she no longer believes in such ""wonderful things happening."" She then leaves, shutting the outer door, leaving Helmer alone and devastated, clinging to a faint hope of ""The most wonderful thing of all—?""."
Alice_s Adventures in Wonderland-Lewis Carroll,"Alice is initially bored, sitting by her sister on a riverbank, when she sees a White Rabbit with pink eyes, wearing a waistcoat, pulling a watch from its pocket and exclaiming, ""Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!"" Driven by curiosity, Alice follows the Rabbit down a large rabbit-hole.

She falls down a deep well, passing various objects like cupboards and bookshelves. During her slow descent, she imagines her destination and talks to herself about her cat, Dinah. She eventually lands unhurt on a pile of sticks and leaves. Continuing her pursuit of the White Rabbit, she finds herself in a long, low hall with many locked doors. She discovers a tiny golden key on a glass table, which is too small for the main doors. Behind a curtain, she finds a small door, about fifteen inches high, which the key fits. Through this door, she glimpses a beautiful garden but cannot fit through.

Returning to the table, Alice finds a bottle labeled ""DRINK ME."" After confirming it's not poison, she drinks its delicious contents, shrinking to ten inches high. Excited, she realizes she's the right size for the garden door, but she has left the golden key on the table, which is now too high for her to reach. She cries in frustration. She then finds a small cake marked ""EAT ME"" under the table and decides to eat it, hoping it will either make her grow to reach the key or shrink to go under the door. She eats the cake, and instead of shrinking, she grows to over nine feet tall, her head hitting the ceiling of the hall.

Now too large, she can only lie down to look through the garden door with one eye. She begins to cry again, shedding so many tears that a large pool forms around her, reaching half-way down the hall. The White Rabbit reappears, dressed splendidly and hurrying, muttering about the Duchess. Alice timidly asks for help, startling the Rabbit, who drops his white kid gloves and fan and flees.

Alice picks up the fan and gloves. As she fans herself, she begins to shrink rapidly. She realizes the fan is causing this and drops it, narrowly avoiding disappearing entirely. She is now about two feet high. She rushes back to the garden door, only to find it shut and the key still out of reach on the table. She slips and falls into the pool of tears she created, finding herself up to her chin in saltwater.

She swims about, wishing she hadn't cried so much, and encounters a Mouse also struggling in the pool. Alice attempts to converse with the Mouse, asking the way out. She tries speaking French (""Où est ma chatte?"") but offends the Mouse, who hates cats. Alice apologizes and tries to soothe it by praising her own cat, Dinah, for catching mice and eating birds. This further offends the Mouse and causes it to swim away. Alice calls it back, promising not to mention cats or dogs. The Mouse returns, agrees to tell its history, and they, along with other creatures who have fallen into the pool (a Duck, Dodo, Lory, and Eaglet), swim to shore.

On the bank, all are wet and miserable. To dry them, the Mouse attempts to recite a dry history lesson about William the Conqueror. However, the other animals, especially the Duck, interrupt with literal interpretations. Alice remains wet. The Dodo proposes a ""Caucus-race,"" explaining it involves everyone running in a circle, starting and stopping when they like, until they are dry. After about half an hour, the Dodo declares everyone has won and must have prizes. Alice is designated the prize-giver and distributes comfits from her pocket. For her own prize, the Dodo presents her with her own thimble.

Alice asks the Mouse to tell its history and explain its hatred for cats and dogs. The Mouse begins a ""long and a sad tale,"" but Alice is distracted, misinterpreting its actual tail and the spoken narrative as a poem about ""Fury and the Mouse"" visually shaped like a tail. The Mouse, offended by Alice's inattention and confusion, declares her an insult and walks away, refusing to continue. Alice mentions her cat Dinah again, praising her hunting prowess, which causes the birds to scatter in fright, leaving Alice alone and crying once more.

The White Rabbit returns, frantically searching for his lost fan and gloves. He mistakes Alice for his housemaid, Mary Ann, and orders her to fetch them from his house. Alice complies, finds the house, and inside, locates a fan and gloves, along with an unlabeled bottle. She drinks from it, hoping to grow, but instead, she grows so enormous that she fills the house, with one arm out a window and one foot up the chimney.

The Rabbit returns, unable to open the door due to Alice's elbow. He tries the window, leading Alice to stretch her hand out and cause a shriek and breaking glass, suggesting he fell. Other voices appear, including ""Pat,"" and they discuss Alice's arm in the window. A plan is made for ""Bill"" (a Lizard) to descend the chimney. Alice kicks her foot down the chimney when Bill approaches. Bill emerges from the chimney ""like a sky-rocket."" The Rabbit suggests burning the house down, but Alice threatens to unleash her cat, Dinah. Pebbles are thrown in, turning into little cakes on the floor. Alice eats one, shrinks, and escapes the house, running into a thick wood.

In the wood, Alice wishes to return to her normal size and find the garden. She encounters an enormous puppy and, after a brief, frightening interaction, manages to escape it. She then finds a large mushroom. Peering over it, she sees a blue Caterpillar smoking a hookah.

The Caterpillar questions Alice's identity, to which Alice replies she hardly knows, having changed sizes so many times. The Caterpillar is dismissive of her confusion. Alice recites a distorted version of ""Father William"" for the Caterpillar, which is deemed ""wrong from beginning to end."" The Caterpillar, three inches high, asks Alice what size she wants to be, then becomes angry when Alice calls three inches a ""wretched height."" The Caterpillar eventually leaves, telling Alice that one side of the mushroom will make her grow taller and the other side shorter. Alice breaks off two pieces. Nibbling one side causes her chin to strike her foot as she shrinks rapidly; nibbling the other causes her neck to grow immensely long, like a serpent, above the treetops. A Pigeon mistakes her for a serpent, complaining about serpents eating eggs. Alice asserts she is a little girl, but the Pigeon refuses to believe her. Alice eventually uses the mushroom pieces to return to her normal size. She then sees a small house and, deciding she is too large to approach it politely, shrinks herself to nine inches high.

Outside the small house, Alice observes a Fish-Footman delivering a croquet invitation from the Queen to a Frog-Footman for the Duchess. Alice, frustrated by the Frog-Footman's nonsensical replies to her attempts to enter, pushes open the door herself. Inside, she finds a smoke-filled kitchen. The Duchess is nursing a sneezing baby, and a Cook is stirring a peppery cauldron, throwing dishes at the Duchess and baby. A grinning Cheshire Cat sits by the fire.

Alice asks about the Cat's grin. The Duchess explains it's a Cheshire Cat, then yells ""Pig!"" at the baby. The Duchess is rude to Alice, then sings a violent lullaby to the baby, shaking it severely. She flings the baby at Alice and leaves to play croquet. Alice struggles to hold the oddly shaped baby, realizing it is turning into a pig. She puts the pig down, and it trots into the wood.

Alice then sees the Cheshire Cat again. She asks for directions. The Cat explains that depending on her destination, she could go to the Hatter or the March Hare, both of whom are mad. The Cat explains they are ""all mad"" here, including Alice, for having come. The Cat offers proof of its own madness (growls when pleased, wags tail when angry). The Cat mentions playing croquet with the Queen and then vanishes and reappears several times, eventually fading away completely except for its grin. Alice walks in the direction of the March Hare's house, which is adorned with ear-shaped chimneys and a fur-thatched roof. She eats more mushroom to grow to two feet tall before approaching.

At the March Hare's house, Alice finds the March Hare and the Hatter having a tea-party under a tree, with a Dormouse asleep between them. They declare ""No room!"" but Alice sits down. They offer wine, which isn't there, and make rude personal remarks and nonsensical statements. The Hatter asks a riddle (""Why is a raven like a writing-desk?"") for which he and the March Hare have no answer. The Hatter reveals they are perpetually at tea-time (six o'clock) because he quarreled with ""Time"" after singing at the Queen's concert. They move around the table as cups get dirty. The Dormouse, repeatedly pinched to stay awake, tells a sleepy story about three sisters who lived in a ""treacle-well"" and drew ""treacle"" and things beginning with ""M."" Alice becomes frustrated by their rudeness and illogic and leaves, vowing never to return.

She finds a door in a tree, enters it, and is back in the long hall. Using the golden key and a piece of mushroom, she adjusts her size to a foot high and finally enters the beautiful garden.

In the garden, Alice sees three card-gardeners (Two, Five, Seven) painting white roses red, fearing the Queen will order their execution for planting the wrong colored rose. The Queen of Hearts arrives with a grand procession of card-soldiers, courtiers, royal children, guests (including the White Rabbit), and the Knave of Hearts. Alice stands her ground as the Queen demands to know her name and who the prostrate gardeners are. When Alice refuses to say, the Queen screams, ""Off with her head!"" but Alice defies her. The Queen orders the gardeners' execution, but Alice hides them in a flower-pot, and the soldiers depart.

The Queen invites Alice to play croquet. The game is chaotic: live hedgehogs are balls, live flamingoes are mallets, and card-soldiers double as arches, constantly moving. The Queen frequently screams ""Off with his head!"" or ""Off with her head!"", and many players are taken into custody. Alice sees the Cheshire Cat's grin appear in the air, then its head. She complains to the Cat about the unfair, rule-less game. The King orders the Cat's head removed, but the executioner argues he cannot cut off a head without a body. The Queen orders the Duchess (who is in prison) to be brought to settle the matter. The Cat's head fades away entirely before the Duchess arrives.

The Duchess is surprisingly pleasant, attributing her previous savagery to pepper. She shares various morals with Alice, connecting substances to temperaments and offering convoluted advice. The Queen suddenly reappears, furious at the Duchess, and threatens her with execution. The Duchess vanishes instantly.

The Queen then sends Alice and the Gryphon to hear the Mock Turtle's story. The Gryphon reveals that the Queen never actually executes anyone; it's just her ""fancy."" They find the Mock Turtle, who, despite the Gryphon's assurances, seems genuinely sad and tearful. The Mock Turtle recounts his time at school in the sea, learning ""Reeling and Writhing,"" ""Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, and Derision,"" and other subjects. The Gryphon explains that ""lessons"" are called so because they ""lessen"" from day to day.

The Mock Turtle then describes the ""Lobster Quadrille,"" a complex dance involving partners and throwing lobsters out to sea. The Mock Turtle and Gryphon demonstrate a portion of the dance, singing a song about a whiting and a snail. They also explain that whitings have their tails in their mouths because they were thrown into the sea, and that ""whitings"" are also used to shine shoes under the sea.

As Alice begins to tell her own adventures, a cry of ""The trial’s beginning!"" is heard. The Gryphon hurries Alice away.

They arrive at a court where the King and Queen of Hearts preside over the trial of the Knave of Hearts, accused of stealing the Queen's tarts. The White Rabbit acts as herald. Jurors (various animals and birds) busily write on slates, even noting down ""stupid things!"" when Alice exclaims it. Alice removes Bill the Lizard's squeaking pencil, forcing him to write with his finger.

The Hatter is called as the first witness, appearing with a teacup and bread-and-butter, nervous and rambling. He gives conflicting dates for when he began tea, and the King incorrectly deduces his hat is stolen. Alice begins to grow again, causing discomfort among the jurors, particularly the Dormouse. The King threatens the Hatter with execution if he doesn't give clear evidence. The Hatter's testimony is nonsensical, full of references to ""twinkling"" and conflicting statements with the March Hare and a sleeping Dormouse. The King dismisses him, but the Queen orders his head chopped off outside, though the Hatter escapes.

The Duchess's Cook is the next witness, refusing to give evidence and only saying tarts are ""Pepper, mostly."" The Dormouse interjects ""Treacle,"" leading to a chaotic scene where the Queen orders the Dormouse beheaded and removed. The Cook disappears in the confusion.

Alice is called as the next witness. Forgetting her rapidly increasing size, she jumps up, overturning the jury-box and scattering the jurymen. The King demands they be put back. Alice testifies she knows ""Nothing whatever"" about the stolen tarts. The King declares this ""important,"" but the White Rabbit corrects him to ""unimportant,"" confusing the jury. The King then reads ""Rule Forty-two: _All persons more than a mile high to leave the court_."" Everyone looks at Alice, who is now very large. Alice refuses to leave, arguing the rule was just invented.

The White Rabbit then produces new evidence: a paper with a set of nonsensical verses, supposedly written by the prisoner, but not in his hand and unsigned. The King attempts to interpret the verses as proof of the Knave's guilt, making strained connections to the Knave and the tarts, and even puns on the word ""fit."" The Queen demands, ""Sentence first—verdict afterwards!"" Alice vehemently protests this injustice, shouting ""Stuff and nonsense!"" The Queen, enraged, screams, ""Off with her head!""

Alice, now at her full size, declares, ""Who cares for you? You’re nothing but a pack of cards!"" At this, the entire pack of cards rises into the air and flies down upon her. Alice screams and tries to beat them off.

Suddenly, Alice finds herself lying on the riverbank, her head in her sister's lap. Her sister wakes her, brushing dead leaves from her face. Alice recounts her ""curious dream"" to her sister. Her sister then closes her eyes and dreams of Alice's adventures, picturing the White Rabbit, the Mouse, the Mad Tea-Party, the Queen's croquet ground, the Gryphon, and the Mock Turtle. She imagines how Alice will grow up and, with her loving heart, share these strange tales and memories of happy summer days with other children."
Anna Karenina-Leo Tolstoy,"This detailed summary covers the plot of the provided text, encompassing ""Anna Karenina"" Parts One through Eight.

**Part One**

The story begins in a state of confusion in the Oblonskys’ household. The wife, Darya Alexandrovna (Dolly), has discovered that her husband, Prince Stepan Arkadyevitch Oblonsky (Stiva), has been having an affair with their former French governess. This revelation has caused a three-day estrangement, with Dolly refusing to leave her room and Stepan absent from home. The entire household is affected, with children running wild, the English governess quitting, and servants giving notice.

Stepan wakes up in his study, recalling a pleasant dream before being confronted with the painful reality of his marital discord. He acknowledges his own fault but believes Dolly will not forgive him, particularly recalling his ""idiotic smile"" during their initial confrontation, which he feels enraged her. He rationalizes that he cannot repent for not loving his wife, only for being caught. His valet, Matvey, informs him that his sister, Anna Arkadyevna, will arrive the next day, and both hope she can mediate a reconciliation. However, Dolly sends a message via Matvey, stating she intends to leave. The nurse, Matrona Philimonovna, urges Stepan to apologize for the sake of the children and the household's stability.

Stepan dresses, reads a liberal newspaper, and deals with a petitioner, making notes for her application. He gives sweets to his children, Grisha and Tanya, but feels a blush of shame when Tanya's questions about her mother reveal her awareness of the quarrel. He debates whether to confront Dolly, believing it futile, but ultimately decides to enter her bedroom.

Dolly is found packing children’s things, intending to leave for her mother's, though she inwardly acknowledges the impossibility of this due to her continued love for Stepan and the practical difficulties of managing five children alone. She tries to appear severe. Stepan, radiating health, apologizes and tells her of Anna's impending arrival. Dolly vehemently rejects the idea of seeing Anna and screams at him to leave, expressing her loathing for his ""passion and loathsomeness."" Stepan, witnessing her suffering, is deeply affected. He pleads with her to consider the children. Dolly, in tears, calls him ""vicious"" and questions how they can live together after his affair with the governess. She calls him ""loathsome, repulsive,"" and a ""stranger."" A child's cry softens her, and she leaves the room, threatening to call the servants and children to expose his ""scoundrel"" nature. Stepan is mortified by her ""vulgar"" shouts. He instructs Matvey to prepare a room for Anna. He leaves for his club, giving Matvey money. Dolly, alone, continues to wrestle with her grief and the impossibility of her situation, but her daily duties reassert themselves.

Stepan's government position in Moscow, obtained through his brother-in-law Alexey Alexandrovitch Karenin, is lucrative and respected, despite Stepan's idleness. He is widely liked. At his office, he efficiently conducts business. His old friend, Konstantin Dmitrievitch Levin, arrives from the country, surprising Stepan. Levin, who despises Stepan's urban life as much as Stepan mocks his rural pursuits, has come to propose to Kitty Shtcherbatskaya, Dolly's younger sister, to whom he has been secretly devoted since their youth. Levin considers himself unworthy of Kitty, an ""ugly"" and ""ordinary"" country gentleman. After two months of self-doubt in the country, he has returned to Moscow determined to propose.

Levin stays with his elder half-brother, Sergey Koznishev, a well-known philosopher, who is engaged in a deep philosophical debate. Levin finds the discussion superficial, avoiding the profound questions of life and death that torment him. Sergey is uninterested in Levin’s farming. Sergey reveals their dissipated brother Nikolay is in Moscow, and advises against seeing him due to his past scandals. Levin, horrified but resolute, decides to visit Nikolay later. He then goes to Stepan's office for news of the Shtcherbatskys, learning Kitty will be at the Zoological Gardens.

At the Zoological Gardens, a nervous Levin spots Kitty among the skaters, finding her radiant. He feels an overwhelming mix of joy and terror. Kitty, after greeting him, invites him to skate together, making him euphoric. As they skate, her face suddenly loses its friendliness when he expresses confidence in her, and she subtly pushes him away, suggesting he talk to her governess. Levin feels he has offended her. Upon her return, Kitty, composed, asks about his plans. Levin, resolved to propose, tells her his stay depends on her. She skates away. Devastated, Levin prays. He then attempts a difficult skating trick. Kitty, leaving with her mother, Princess Shtcherbatskaya, is internally touched by Levin but wonders about his words. The Princess stiffly invites Levin to call, but Kitty offers a warm ""Good-bye till this evening."" Stepan arrives, and he and Levin agree to dine together. Levin is ecstatic, replaying Kitty’s words, while Stepan plans the dinner menu.

At the restaurant, Levin is repulsed by the artificiality of urban life, finding solace only in thoughts of Kitty. Stepan orders an extravagant meal, which Levin dismisses as part of a ""civilized"" aim for enjoyment, preferring to be a ""savage."" Stepan calls all Levins ""savages."" Stepan then asks about Kitty, subtly indicating he knows Levin's intentions, and confirms his wife, Dolly, believes Kitty will marry Levin. Levin is overcome with joy, proclaiming his love is a powerful, external force. He confesses his past sins and unworthiness. Stepan offers comfort, but implies that Levin's ""all of a piece"" nature is both a strength and a weakness, and life requires more flexibility.

Stepan then warns Levin about Vronsky, describing him as a wealthy, handsome, and promising rival for Kitty. Levin is angered by this comparison, feeling his pure love is profaned. Stepan advises him to propose quickly. Stepan then asks Levin for advice on his own infidelity, portraying the ""other woman"" as a sympathetic victim. Levin vehemently rejects this, calling fallen women ""vermin."" Stepan describes the ""fearful tragedy"" of a marriage where love has died. Levin, recalling his own sins, unexpectedly agrees. Both feel a growing distance between them. Stepan finds relief in superficial conversation with an aide-de-camp. Levin pays the exorbitant bill and leaves for the Shtcherbatskys', determined.

Kitty, at eighteen, is a successful debutante with two suitors. Her father favors Levin; her mother, who seeks a ""brilliant match,"" prefers Vronsky, a wealthy, aristocratic officer who openly flirts with Kitty. The princess is anxious about the changing social customs around marriage and fears Vronsky might not propose. Kitty reveals Vronsky is waiting for his mother's arrival before an ""important undertaking,"" which her mother interprets as a forthcoming proposal. When Levin reappears, the princess worries he will complicate matters. Kitty, distressed by her mother's mercenary view, asks her not to speak of it.

That evening, Kitty feels immense pressure. She fondly recalls Levin, but Vronsky promises a brilliant future. She realizes Levin has come to propose and she must reject him, which pains her. She resolves to tell the truth. Levin enters, finds her alone, and proposes. Kitty is ecstatic but remembers Vronsky and hastily refuses, saying, ""That cannot be ... forgive me."" The princess enters, relieved. Countess Nordston arrives and teases Levin. Vronsky then enters, and Kitty's brightening eyes reveal her love for him to Levin. Vronsky, with a tender look, shakes Kitty's hand. Levin feels despair and hatred. The conversation turns to spiritualism, which Levin dismisses. The old prince, Kitty's father, arrives, warmly embracing Levin but coolly greeting Vronsky. He makes a joke against table-turning. Levin, seeing Kitty's happy face as she discusses a ball with Vronsky, leaves in despair.

Kitty, after refusing Levin, feels glad to have received an offer but is haunted by his dejected face. Her happiness is ""poisoned by doubts."" Her parents argue, the prince furious that his wife ruined Kitty's chance with Levin for a ""feather-head"" like Vronsky. The princess defends her actions, hinting at Vronsky's imminent proposal. The prince accuses her of preparing wretchedness for Kitty. The parents part, each convinced of their own view. The princess, in terror, prays.

Vronsky, having no traditional home life, views marriage as ridiculous. He has enjoyed his ""discovery"" of pleasure with Kitty, never believing it could be wrong or lead to marriage. He feels a stronger bond with Kitty after their evening together. He dismisses social life for a quiet evening. The next day, at the railway station, he meets Stepan, who teases him about being in love with Kitty. Stepan reveals Levin's proposal and rejection, and Kitty's illness. Vronsky dismisses Levin, feeling Kitty deserves better. He sees Anna Karenina, Stepan's sister, for the first time, and is captivated by her ""caressing and soft"" expression. He helps call Stepan. Anna and his mother exchange pleasantries. Anna, aware of Vronsky's attention, returns his subtle flirtation. A railway guard is crushed by a train; Anna is agitated, and Vronsky immediately gives money for the widow. Anna sees the accident as an ""omen of evil."" Stepan, still hoping Anna will reconcile him and Dolly, tells her they expect Vronsky to marry Kitty. Anna asks ""Yes?"" softly.

Anna spends the day with Dolly and her children, who are suffering from scarlatina. Anna reconciles Dolly and Stepan. Kitty, recovering from her illness, admires Anna. Anna subtly hints at her own hidden ""skeleton"" and confesses she is leaving Moscow early to avoid Vronsky, who she believes made Kitty jealous at the ball. Anna asserts that she only meant to be a matchmaker. Dolly is skeptical, but Anna dismisses her concerns, embracing Dolly as a dear friend. Anna feels she is ""lost"" but finds comfort in Dolly's love. She leaves for Petersburg. On the train, Anna is overcome by a sense of shame and nervous delirium. At a station, she encounters Vronsky, who has followed her. He declares his love, saying he cannot help it. Anna is terrified but also blissful. She tells him his words are wrong and asks him to forget them, but feels they are drawn ""fearfully closer."" She does not sleep, experiencing visions. In Petersburg, she is struck by her husband, Alexey Alexandrovitch's, ""frigid and imposing figure"" and ""sarcastic smile."" She feels a ""disagreeable sensation"" and ""hypocrisy"" in his presence. Alexey Alexandrovitch dismisses Vronsky and tells Anna to visit Countess Lidia Ivanovna.

Seryozha, Anna's son, joyfully greets her, but Anna feels a slight disappointment, having idealized him. She dismisses Vronsky's words as ""silly"" and believes she can ignore his pursuit, convincing herself that there's no need to tell her husband. Alexey Alexandrovitch, after observing Anna's public interaction with Vronsky, decides to speak to her. He struggles with the idea of jealousy, seeing his wife's potential infidelity as an illogical chasm in his ordered life. He plans to warn her about public opinion and the religious significance of marriage. Anna, sensing his purpose, pretends misunderstanding and irritation. He accuses her of behaving improperly. Anna, angered by his ""coarseness,"" calls his approach ""base."" He forces her to sit down and accuses her of forsaking husband and child for a lover while living off his bread. Anna, feeling the justice of his words, is silent. He threatens divorce and to take Seryozha. Anna pleads with him to leave Seryozha. Alexey Alexandrovitch, enraged, leaves.

Alexey Alexandrovitch visits a lawyer to discuss divorce, but is disturbed by the lawyer's cynical approach, which includes methods like ""adultery by mutual consent."" He refuses to fabricate a case, citing religious scruples and a desire to avoid public scandal, which would also ruin Anna. He sends Anna a letter, stating he will not break their ties but expects her to cease all intercourse with her lover, threatening her and Seryozha if she fails. He finds satisfaction in this ""religious sanction"" to his decision, believing he is giving her a chance to reform. Anna, devastated by the letter, sees it as his ""mean character"" to torture her. She realizes her initial hope for a clean break is shattered, and she is still bound to a life of ""lying and deceit."" She contemplates suicide, but then resolves to find Vronsky, believing he alone can help. She writes a brief, cold reply to her husband and leaves for Betsy's, hoping to find Vronsky.

At Betsy's croquet party, Anna, though she knows Vronsky will not be there, feels a strange fascination in the ""playing with words"" and ""hiding of a secret."" She meets Sappho Shtoltz, a new, bold figure in society, and Liza Merkalova, a languid beauty. She finds Liza more attractive and sincere. They discuss the ""new manner"" of relationships and the ""husband's rôle."" Anna confesses her inability to understand it. Betsy, sensing Anna's plight, offers to help. Anna, in a moment of impulse, writes a note to Vronsky, asking him to meet her at the Vrede garden.

**Part Two**

Kitty's health declines after her refusal of Levin and Vronsky's apparent abandonment. Doctors recommend a trip abroad. Her father, the prince, believes her illness is due to emotional distress, not physical. He blames his wife's matchmaking. Dolly visits, concerned for Kitty and her own marital troubles. Kitty, in a fit of anger, lashes out at Dolly, accusing her of having accepted an unfaithful husband. Dolly, hurt, realizes Kitty's suffering is due to Vronsky's deception. Kitty reveals her self-loathing and shame. Dolly soothes her, and Kitty agrees to stay with Dolly's children, who are ill with scarlatina. The Shtcherbatskys then go abroad for Kitty's health.

Anna, in Petersburg, is unhappy with her husband's official set and Countess Lidia Ivanovna's hypocritical religious circle. She now frequents Princess Betsy Tverskaya's fashionable world, where she meets Vronsky and is filled with ""agitating joy."" She realizes his pursuit is the ""whole interest of her life."" Vronsky, also finding their affair to be his sole interest, is caught in its grip. After a fulfilling evening, he feels compelled to take ""some step."" He goes home, but cannot sleep, replaying their moments. He meets Stepan at the station, where a railway guard is killed. Anna sees this as an ""omen of evil."" Vronsky, after giving money to the widow, dismisses the news of Levin proposing to Kitty. He is struck by Alexey Alexandrovitch's coldness and Anna's reserve.

Vronsky and Anna's love is consummated. Anna feels ""sinful"" and ""guilty,"" but also a ""blissful"" new life. Vronsky feels like a ""murderer"" of their initial love. He is haunted by the shame. Anna says, ""All is over; I have nothing but you."" She experiences vivid nightmares where both Alexey Alexandrovitch and Vronsky are her husbands.

Levin, though still pained by Kitty's rejection, focuses on his farming and work. He resolves to live a pure and independent life. His brother Nikolay, in failing health, visits him, and Levin helps arrange for him to go to a watering-place abroad. Levin begins writing a book on agriculture. Spring arrives, invigorating him. He enjoys mowing with the peasants, finding deep satisfaction in physical labor and human connection. He discovers a profound truth in the simple words of a peasant, that one must live ""for God, for my soul,"" which transforms his worldview and brings him spiritual peace. He then encounters Kitty and her family in a carriage, reinforcing his love for her.

Alexey Alexandrovitch struggles with Anna's public affair and his own humiliation. Countess Lidia Ivanovna, deeply in love with Alexey Alexandrovitch, offers him spiritual guidance and manages his household. He embraces a new, mystical Christian faith as a defense against his shame. He becomes cold to his son, Seryozha, whom Lidia Ivanovna tells is motherless. Seryozha, though outwardly complying with his father's strict, formal education, secretly longs for his mother.

Vronsky is recovering from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, which he claims was an accident. He feels the shame of his actions has been ""washed away."" He resolves to renounce Anna and go to Tashkend for a military appointment. Betsy, however, tells him Alexey Alexandrovitch has agreed to a divorce. Vronsky, forgetting his resolutions, rushes to Anna. She embraces him, confessing he has ""conquered"" her. She still worries about Seryozha and the divorce, and reveals she is pregnant, recalling her nightmare of death in childbirth. Vronsky declines the Tashkend appointment and retires from the army for her sake. They decide to go abroad without a divorce.

**Part Five**

Levin and Kitty marry after a hurried wedding. Levin, in a state of delirious happiness, lets others manage the arrangements. He finds the required confession and communion painful due to his unbelief. However, he goes through with it, and finds a subtle, positive impression from the priest's words. On the wedding day, Levin experiences intense anxiety, doubting Kitty's love. He confronts her, offering to call off the wedding. Kitty, distressed, reassures him of her love, saying she understands him completely. They reconcile. The wedding ceremony is performed, with Levin and Kitty both deeply moved, though Kitty is barely conscious of the words, overwhelmed by the joy of a new life beginning.

Vronsky and Anna travel in Europe. They meet Golenishtchev, an old comrade of Vronsky's, who is writing a book. Vronsky, bored with their aimless life, is pleased by the distraction. They visit the studio of a Russian artist, Mihailov, whose painting of Christ fascinates Anna. Mihailov is initially dismissive of them as dilettantes but is delighted when Golenishtchev and Anna praise his work. Vronsky buys one of Mihailov's paintings and commissions a portrait of Anna. Vronsky's own attempts at painting quickly wane. He and Anna grow tired of their life abroad and decide to return to Russia.

Levin is happy in his marriage but surprised by the domestic realities. He struggles with Kitty's focus on household details, initially finding it jarring but then admiring her instinct for homemaking. Their early married life is marked by frequent quarrels, often over trivial matters, which he finds humiliating. He learns to suppress his anger and soothe her. He confesses his feelings of unworthiness, and she assures him of her love. Kitty becomes pregnant. He is delighted but also mystified by this new development.

Marya Nikolaevna informs Levin that his brother Nikolay is dying in a provincial hotel. Levin and Kitty travel there. Nikolay, emaciated and irritable, is still clinging to hope for recovery. Kitty takes charge, cleaning his room and arranging for a new doctor. Her practical compassion contrasts with Levin's horror and helplessness. Nikolay eventually dies, saying, ""I'm setting off. It's the end."" Levin is devastated by the enigma of death but finds solace in Kitty's love, which becomes stronger. The doctor confirms Kitty is pregnant.

Alexey Alexandrovitch, after Anna's departure, is crushed by his loneliness and perceived public contempt. Countess Lidia Ivanovna offers him moral support and manages his household. He embraces a new, mystical interpretation of Christianity, believing it offers salvation and justifies his actions. He refuses Anna's request to see Seryozha, claiming it would harm the child. Vronsky, after his suicide attempt, is released from his sense of shame. He rushes to Anna, and they reaffirm their love. Anna reveals her pregnancy and expresses her desire for a divorce. Vronsky gives up his military career for her. They go abroad without obtaining a divorce.

**Part Six**

Dolly and her children spend the summer at the Levins' estate. The old princess and Varenka also join them. Levin feels his ""Levin world"" is overwhelmed by the ""Shtcherbatsky element."" Kitty, now pregnant, proposes that Sergey Ivanovitch and Varenka, who show signs of mutual interest, go mushroom picking together. Levin, in a state of jealousy and irritation over Veslovsky's flirtation with Kitty, is vexed by the various guests.

The ladies make jam on the terrace. Dolly, Kitty, and the princess discuss marriage, comparing their own experiences and views on love versus practicality. Kitty asks her mother how her father proposed, and they reminisce. Kitty is excited for Sergey and Varenka, but also expresses her deep love for Levin. Levin, consumed by jealousy, overhears a conversation between Kitty and Veslovsky. He becomes enraged, feeling Veslovsky is flirting with his wife. He confronts Kitty, expressing his ""wounded, humiliated"" feelings. She reassures him of her love, and he, calling himself a ""criminal,"" resolves to keep Veslovsky there and be civil.

The next day, Levin, Stepan, and Veslovsky go shooting. Levin, still battling jealousy, finds Veslovsky's presence irritating. Veslovsky, in his eagerness, drives the horses into a marsh, getting them stuck. Levin is vexed but hides his anger. They have lunch. Levin expresses his disgust for capitalists like Malthus, calling their wealth dishonest. Stepan defends them, and challenges Levin's own privileges. They argue about the nature of work and social justice. Veslovsky, noticing women singing, leaves to join them. Stepan suggests they go too, but Levin refuses, wanting to leave early for shooting.

At the Gvozdyov marsh, Levin and Stepan try to get rid of Veslovsky. Levin, shooting poorly, becomes more frustrated. Veslovsky, undeterred, continues to enjoy himself. Levin, exhausted and disgusted by his failures, sits down. He has only five birds. He returns to Stepan, who has shot fourteen.

They return to the peasant's hut. Veslovsky praises the peasants' hospitality. The conversation turns to wealth and privilege. Levin argues against dishonest gain, while Stepan defends his own large salary. Levin admits the inequality but struggles with how to act. Veslovsky suggests they join women singing. Levin declines, still wrestling with his principles. He resolves to go shooting early.

Levin wakes early and goes shooting alone. He is successful, killing three snipe. He finds a note from Kitty, assuring him she is well and happy, and has a midwife with her. Levin is pleased. He returns to find all the food packed by Kitty has been eaten by Veslovsky, which initially vexes him but then he laughs about it. In the evening, they shoot again, and Veslovsky is successful. On the way home, Veslovsky entertains them with stories of his flirtations. Levin feels his hostility towards Veslovsky has vanished.

The next day, Levin, still battling jealousy, is disturbed by Veslovsky's continued flirtation with Kitty. He is also troubled by his mother-in-law's discussions about Kitty's confinement in Moscow. Levin feels increasingly angry and humiliated. He resolves to send Veslovsky away. He confronts Veslovsky, ordering him to leave, claiming he expects visitors. Veslovsky is initially surprised, then bows and leaves. Stepan Arkadyevitch is furious at Levin's ""ridiculous"" behavior, but Levin defends his actions, citing his and Kitty's suffering. Veslovsky departs with a mechanician. Despite the princess's anger, the household becomes lively again.

Dolly visits Anna at Vozdvizhenskoe. On the journey, Dolly reflects on her unhappy marriage and the burden of childbearing. She constructs an imaginary love affair for herself, similar to Anna's, which makes her smile. She is impressed by Vronsky's luxurious estate and Anna's confident, elegant appearance. Anna, blushing slightly, expresses her happiness and says she's ""inexcusably happy."" Dolly is initially reserved but softens. Anna reveals she and Vronsky call their baby daughter Annie (Karenina). Anna also admits she has chosen not to have more children, shocking Dolly. Dolly is unsettled by Anna's arguments, feeling a growing distance between them. Anna then tells Dolly about her attempts to keep Vronsky entertained in the country. Dolly is impressed by Vronsky's enthusiasm for his hospital project, but still feels uneasy. She resolves to return home the next day.

Anna and Vronsky spend the summer and autumn together. Anna dedicates herself to pleasing Vronsky, studying his interests. Vronsky, however, experiences _ennui_ and feels stifled by her devotion. His ambition, reawakened by his friend Serpuhovskoy's success, conflicts with his love for Anna. He becomes deeply involved in his estate management. In October, Vronsky attends the provincial elections, intending to support Sviazhsky. He is surprised by Anna's composure at his departure, feeling she is hiding something.

**Part Seven**

Levin has been in Moscow for three months for Kitty's confinement, which is overdue. Kitty is calm and happy, her heart filled with love for her unborn child. Levin, however, is restless and feels out of place in the city. He tries to work on his book but finds his ideas muddled. Kitty meets Vronsky at a social gathering. She manages to be composed and indifferent, which pleases her father and reassures Levin. Levin tells Kitty about his meeting with Anna, and Kitty, consumed by jealousy, accuses him of being in love with Anna. They quarrel, but reconcile after he confesses to being swayed by Anna's ""artful influence"" and his own ""degeneration"" in Moscow.

Levin accompanies Natalia (Lvov's wife) to a concert and a public meeting, where he is bored by the intellectual discussions. He visits Countess Bola, finding the social call equally tiresome. He is continually reminded of his financial difficulties. He later returns to Lvov's, discussing children's education and religion. He is touched by Lvov's sincerity.

At the club, Levin dines with Stepan and other friends. He is pleased to meet Vronsky, with whom he feels no hostility. Stepan expresses his desire for Levin and Vronsky to be friends. Stepan then takes Levin to Anna's Moscow apartment. He tells Levin that Anna is waiting for her divorce, living in seclusion. Anna greets Levin warmly. He is struck by Mihailov's portrait of Anna and by her living beauty. Anna, in turn, praises Levin's wit and insights into art. She speaks of her charitable work, teaching an English girl and helping a poor family. Levin is drawn to her truth and depth of feeling, but also senses the ""bitterness of her position."" She hints at her despair. She asks him to tell Kitty that she loves her and wishes she never suffers as Anna has. Levin blushes, promising to tell Kitty.

Anna is consumed by jealousy and feels Vronsky is becoming cold. She blames him for her misery and the delayed divorce. She struggles with impulses of anger and despair. She confronts Vronsky, accusing him of ""obstinacy"" and of not loving her. She confesses her feelings of being on the ""brink of calamity."" He tries to soothe her, assuring his love. She then hints at her impending death in childbirth, recalling her dream of the peasant. He dismisses her fears. They reconcile, and she suggests they get a divorce and go to Moscow. Vronsky agrees, but Anna sees a ""vindictive look"" in his eyes. They travel to Moscow, living as a married couple.

**Part Eight**

Two months after Anna's death, Sergey Ivanovitch's scholarly book is a failure. He finds new purpose in the Slavonic question and the Servian War, seeing it as a manifestation of the people's will. He and Katavasov travel to the country. At the station, they witness volunteers leaving for Servia. Sergey Ivanovitch talks to a princess who informs him Vronsky is on the same train, going to Servia. Stepan Arkadyevitch also appears, praising the volunteers. Sergey Ivanovitch finds Vronsky on the platform, suffering and silent. Vronsky, consumed by his grief over Anna, states his life is worthless and he welcomes death in battle. He recalls Anna's ""bloodstained body"" and her last, bitter words. They part.

Sergey Ivanovitch and Katavasov reach Levin's estate. Kitty is happy with her baby, Mitya. She reflects on Levin's spiritual journey. Levin, haunted by his brother Nikolay's death, grapples with his unbelief. He finds solace in the simple faith of Kitty and the peasants, embracing the idea of living ""for God."" He sees this as a moral compass that reason cannot provide. He resolves to live according to these truths. He then recalls a childhood memory, realizing he has always lived by these spiritual truths, though he sought to intellectualize them. He comes to terms with the ineffability of faith. He is filled with joy and gratitude.

Levin is called to the nursery for Mitya's bath. He had felt only disgust for the baby before, but now, seeing Mitya recognize him, he is surprised and delighted, feeling a new, intense apprehension and love. Kitty is radiant with maternal happiness.

Stepan Arkadyevitch, in Petersburg, finds his finances in disarray. He seeks a lucrative appointment. He visits Countess Lidia Ivanovna, who is deeply in love with Alexey Alexandrovitch and has become his spiritual guide. She describes Alexey Alexandrovitch's transformed heart and his new, mystical Christian faith. She reveals Anna and Vronsky are in Petersburg and that Alexey Alexandrovitch, after consulting Landau (a clairvoyant), has refused Anna's divorce. Stepan is confused by this religious fervor. He later reports this refusal to Anna.

Anna is in despair. She reflects on Vronsky's perceived waning love and her own mounting jealousy. She feels he is merely tolerating her. She decides they must either live together or separate, and she will write for a divorce. Vronsky is angered by her defiance and her claim that he no longer loves her. He tells her she tries his patience. She claims she will die, recalling her nightmare. They reconcile, but she senses a ""vindictive look"" in his eyes. Anna writes to Alexey Alexandrovitch for a divorce and goes to Moscow with Vronsky, establishing themselves as a married couple.

Kitty's confinement is delayed. Levin struggles to adapt to Moscow life, finding it purposeless. Kitty meets Vronsky, remaining composed, which reassures Levin. Levin visits a savant, Metrov, to discuss his book on agriculture. He realizes his ideas, derived from his unique understanding of Russian labor, are distinct from conventional economic theories. He asserts that schools are useless without economic improvement.

At the club, Levin has a pleasant time, reconciled with Vronsky. Stepan suggests they visit Anna. Levin is intrigued. He is struck by Anna's beauty and intelligence, her charitable work, and her subtle sadness. She asks him to tell Kitty she loves her but wishes Kitty never has to suffer as she has. Levin, deeply affected, promises.

Levin receives a letter from his bailiff about wheat prices and from his sister about her property. He makes quick decisions, but feels guilty about his sister's unfinished business. He tells Kitty about his meeting with Anna. Kitty, overwhelmed by jealousy, accuses him of being in love with Anna and demands they leave Moscow. He soothes her, admitting his pity for Anna and his own ""degeneration"" in Moscow. They reconcile.

Levin hears of his brother Nikolay's final decline. Kitty insists on accompanying him. They find Nikolay gravely ill. Kitty takes charge, bringing comfort and order to the chaotic sickroom. Nikolay dies, expressing a sense of ""setting off."" Levin is again faced with the mystery of death, but is saved from despair by Kitty's love. The doctor confirms Kitty is pregnant.

Alexey Alexandrovitch, after Anna's departure, is lost and alone. Countess Lidia Ivanovna solidifies her control over his household and spiritual life. Seryozha still secretly misses his mother. Anna, distraught after seeing Seryozha, feels Vronsky's love waning. She believes he has deserted her. Driven by despair and a desire for revenge, she goes to the railway station and throws herself under a train, dying instantly.

Sergey Ivanovitch, after the failure of his book, embraces the Slavonic cause. He meets Vronsky, who is going to Servia, seeking death in battle. Levin, at his country estate, finds peace in his family and work, guided by an inner sense of faith that transcends reason. He accepts his inconsistencies, finding meaning in goodness and love.

The text ends with Levin on his estate, reflecting on his newfound faith. He acknowledges that despite his intellectual doubts and personal flaws, his life now holds a ""positive meaning of goodness"" derived from an inner, inexplicable conviction. He understands that while he will continue to face challenges and personal struggles, his spiritual foundation is firm. He accepts that his profound connection to his wife and child, and his dedication to living a life of goodness, provide an unshakeable purpose."
Crime and Punishment-Fyodor Dostoyevsky,"The story begins on a hot July evening with a young man, Raskolnikov, leaving his cramped garret apartment in S. Place. He is deeply in debt to his landlady and avoids meeting her, not out of cowardice, but due to his overstrained, irritable, and isolated condition, exacerbated by poverty and a month of self-absorption. He walks towards K. bridge, contemplating a mysterious ""plan"" or ""exploit."" He is particularly anxious about his noticeable, worn-out hat, fearing it will draw attention and spoil his scheme.

He makes his way to a large house, where he had previously visited an old pawnbroker, Alyona Ivanovna. He notes that a German clerk is moving out of a flat on the fourth floor, meaning only the old woman will be home. He rings her bell, and she, a diminutive, withered woman of sixty, opens the door suspiciously. Raskolnikov states he is a student and is there on the ""same errand"" as a month ago. He offers to pawn an old silver watch. Alyona Ivanovna, named Alyona Ivanovna, offers him a meager sum, reminding him his previous pledge is overdue. He eventually accepts a rouble and fifteen copecks for the watch. Before leaving, he casually asks if her sister, Lizaveta, is always at home.

Leaving the pawnbroker's, Raskolnikov is overwhelmed by repulsion and agitation, questioning the ""atrocious thing"" he has been contemplating. He enters a tavern, drinks beer, and feels temporarily relieved, dismissing his earlier thoughts. There, he meets a drunken, retired government clerk named Marmeladov. Marmeladov, in a long, self-pitying confession, reveals his extreme poverty, his wife Katerina Ivanovna’s consumption, and his daughter Sonia's forced entry into prostitution to support the family. He describes Sonia's silent sacrifice of thirty roubles, her ""yellow ticket,"" and how he stole her last money to drink. He asks Raskolnikov for pity, then, in a moment of despair, delivers a religious monologue about God's mercy. Marmeladov then insists Raskolnikov accompany him home, expressing fear of his wife's eyes and the children's hunger, but not her physical blows, which he sees as ""consolation.""

At Marmeladov's squalid room, Katerina Ivanovna, emaciated and coughing, confronts her drunken husband, accusing him of wasting their money and leaving the children hungry. She drags him by the hair while he cries out in perverse satisfaction. Raskolnikov, witnessing this, covertly leaves coppers on the windowsill before departing. He bitterly reflects on Sonia's situation and his sister Dounia's impending marriage, seeing parallels between their sacrifices. He then questions his own nature, pondering if man is a scoundrel.

The next day, Raskolnikov wakes up bilious and irritable in his tiny, dusty garret. Nastasya, his landlady's servant, brings him tea and mentions the landlady, Praskovya Pavlovna, plans to complain to the police about his unpaid rent. He tells Nastasya he is ""thinking"" as work and admits he desires ""a fortune."" He receives a letter from his mother, Pulcheria Alexandrovna. The letter details his sister Dounia's difficult time as a governess with the Svidrigaïlovs, where the husband, Mr. Svidrigaïlov, harassed her with ""infamous proposals."" Dounia's reputation was later cleared by Marfa Petrovna (Svidrigaïlov's wife) after she discovered the truth. The letter then announces Dounia's engagement to Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin, a wealthy, forty-five-year-old counselor who wants to marry a poor girl he can be a benefactor to. His mother hopes this marriage will secure Raskolnikov's future and allow them all to move to Petersburg.

Raskolnikov is enraged by the letter, seeing Dounia's marriage as a sacrifice for his benefit, comparable to Sonia's prostitution. He vows to prevent it. He then encounters a severely drunken young girl on a boulevard, being stalked by a gentleman. Raskolnikov intervenes, calling the gentleman ""Svidrigaïlov"" and giving a policeman money to help the girl. However, a sudden change of heart makes him tell the policeman to let them be. He reflects on his own inability to save others. He then remembers he was going to see his friend Razumihin for work.

He falls asleep in a park and has a horrific dream of a small boy witnessing a group of drunken peasants brutally beat an old mare to death. He wakes up horrified, connecting the dream to his ""plan"" of murder. He feels he cannot commit the act. Yet, as he returns, he coincidentally overhears Lizaveta Ivanovna, the pawnbroker's sister, arranging to be away from home at seven o'clock the next day, leaving the old woman alone. This unexpected opportunity seals his resolve, and he feels ""everything was suddenly and irrevocably decided.""

On the day of the planned murder, Raskolnikov discovers Nastasya is in the kitchen, preventing him from taking the axe he intended. He finds an axe hidden in the porter's room and secures it in a specially made noose under his coat. He goes to Alyona Ivanovna's flat, rings the bell, and gains entry. The old woman, suspicious, opens the door slightly. He forces his way in, presents the ""pledge"" (a fake, weighted cigarette case) to distract her, and while she is preoccupied, strikes her on the head with the blunt side of the axe, killing her. He then finds her keys and hurries into the bedroom to find her valuables. While searching, he hears Lizaveta enter the main room. Panic-stricken, he kills Lizaveta with the sharp side of the axe, as she silently backs away in terror.

Overwhelmed by fear and loathing, he cleans the axe and his blood-stained hands and boots. He discovers the outer door has been open all along. As he tries to escape, he hears two men (Koch and a student, later identified as Pestryakov) approaching the door. He slips into an empty flat on the floor below, hiding from them. He overhears them discussing the locked door and their subsequent return with the porter to find it unlatched. They speculate the murderer was inside and escaped. Raskolnikov then slips away and returns home, burying the stolen money and jewels under a stone in a deserted courtyard.

The next morning, Raskolnikov discovers congealed blood on his trousers and sock, which he attempts to hide. He is summoned to the police station regarding an unpaid IOU to his landlady. There, he faints when he overhears officials discussing the pawnbroker murder, including details about a painter named Nikolay, who confessed to the crime after trying to hang himself and being found with the old woman's earrings. Raskolnikov, relieved the summons is not about the murder, defiantly argues with the assistant superintendent, Ilya Petrovitch.

Upon returning home, Raskolnikov disposes of the bloody items and the remaining stolen trinkets under a stone. He encounters Razumihin, who is concerned about his illness and has bought him new clothes with his mother's money. Razumihin, now friends with police clerk Zametov, tells Raskolnikov about the ongoing murder investigation, strongly arguing for Nikolay's innocence based on his ""childish scuffling"" at the time of the murder, which doesn't fit the profile of a cunning killer. Razumihin suggests the true murderer was inside, dropped the earrings, and then escaped. Raskolnikov is agitated when Razumihin mentions the earrings found ""behind the door.""

Later, Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin arrives at Raskolnikov's room. Raskolnikov, still ill and agitated, aggressively rejects Luzhin's presence and insults him, accusing him of marrying Dounia for control. He threatens to throw Luzhin downstairs if he mentions his mother again. Zossimov and Razumihin are present during this confrontation. Svidrigaïlov, the former employer of Dounia, then appears, claiming to have heard about Dounia's engagement and offering Raskolnikov 10,000 roubles to break it off. Svidrigaïlov also reveals that Marfa Petrovna left Dounia 3,000 roubles in her will. Raskolnikov, suspicious, refuses Svidrigaïlov's offer and tells him to leave.

Raskolnikov's mother and sister arrive, having learned of the broken engagement. Raskolnikov, still in a feverish state, reaffirms his opposition to Dounia's marriage to Luzhin. Dounia, however, asserts her independence and says she is marrying Luzhin for her own sake, to escape poverty. Raskolnikov accuses her of lying. They discuss Luzhin's insulting letter to his mother, which contained false accusations against Raskolnikov and Sonia. Dounia then decides to confront Luzhin that evening.

Sonia Marmeladov arrives, invited by Katerina Ivanovna to the funeral dinner. She is shy and timid. Raskolnikov introduces her to his mother and sister. He then takes her aside and, after much internal struggle, confesses to murdering Alyona Ivanovna and Lizaveta. Sonia is horrified but responds with deep compassion, urging him to confess publicly, to ""kiss the earth"" and say ""I am a murderer!"" He resists, arguing about the nature of crime and his belief in being an ""extraordinary man"" who has the right to transgress. He ultimately rejects her suggestion to give himself up, claiming he will fight his case. Sonia gives him a cypress wood cross.

Lebeziatnikov interrupts, reporting that Katerina Ivanovna, in her madness, is dragging her children into the street to perform with a barrel-organ and beg, hoping to shame a general she blames for her misfortunes. Sonia rushes to them, followed by Raskolnikov. At the chaotic scene, Katerina Ivanovna collapses, spitting blood. She is carried to Sonia's room, where she dies. Svidrigaïlov appears, having heard everything from his adjoining room (he had been listening through the wall). He offers to take care of Katerina Ivanovna's children, placing them in orphanages and setting aside money for them. He reveals he knows Raskolnikov's secret, having overheard his confession to Sonia.

Later, Raskolnikov is again visited by Porfiry Petrovitch, who, despite Nikolay's confession, subtly reveals he still suspects Raskolnikov. Porfiry uses psychological tactics, hinting at Raskolnikov's article about ""extraordinary men"" and their ""right to crime,"" and mentions Raskolnikov's visit to the old woman's flat after the murder, questioning him about seeing workmen there (which Raskolnikov denies, though he had seen them on his ""rehearsal"" visit). Porfiry openly states his conviction that Raskolnikov is the murderer, but offers him a ""mitigation of sentence"" if he confesses, telling him to ""suffer."" He tells Raskolnikov he won't run away because he is ""psychologically unable"" and will eventually confess.

Raskolnikov is deeply agitated but also feels a strange sense of clarity and a renewed will to live. He goes to see his mother, who is delighted by his visit, but reveals she senses a great sorrow within him. He tells her he loves her and asks her to pray for him. He then sees Dounia, who tells him she knows his secret through Razumihin. She offers her unwavering support. Raskolnikov, despite his earlier resistance, is now softened. He tells Dounia that Razumihin is a good man, implying a connection between them, and gives her a portrait of his deceased fiancée. He acknowledges he is a ""contemptible person"" but still believes he can fight his fate.

In a dramatic shift, Raskolnikov, after much internal conflict, decides to give himself up. He goes to the Hay Market and, remembering Sonia's words, kneels down and kisses the earth, but the words ""I am a murderer"" die on his lips due to the mocking comments of the crowd. He then goes to the police office, where he encounters Ilya Petrovitch. Ilya Petrovitch, now in a good mood and full of praises, informs him that Svidrigaïlov has shot himself. Shocked, Raskolnikov, with white lips, finally confesses to Ilya Petrovitch: ""_It was I killed the old pawnbroker woman and her sister Lizaveta with an axe and robbed them._""

**EPILOGUE**

Raskolnikov is sentenced to eight years of penal servitude in Siberia. His trial is straightforward due to his clear and precise confession, including details about the fake ""pledge"" and the hiding place of the stolen goods. The fact that he never used the money or trinkets, and couldn't even remember them, leads some psychologists to conclude the crime was due to temporary mental derangement. Raskolnikov, however, maintains he killed out of poverty and a desire to provide for his future, and that he confessed out of ""heartfelt repentance."" The court takes into account his abnormal mental state, his rescue of children from a fire, and his support for a fellow student, resulting in a merciful sentence.

During the trial, Raskolnikov's mother falls ill with a nervous disorder. Dounia and Razumihin move her away from Petersburg and invent a story about Raskolnikov's business trip. Pulcheria Alexandrovna, in her partial mental derangement, believes he is in hiding from powerful enemies and will become a great statesman. She continually reads his article and boasts of his talents. Dounia realizes her mother senses the truth but is afraid to acknowledge it.

Five months after his confession, Raskolnikov is sentenced. Razumihin and Sonia visit him. Dounia and Razumihin plan to move to Siberia in five years to be with him. Raskolnikov, before leaving, predicts his mother's death, which occurs within a fortnight from brain fever. In her delirium, she reveals she knew much more about his terrible fate.

Sonia follows Raskolnikov to Siberia, making preparations with Svidrigaïlov's money. She visits him regularly, providing factual updates to the Razumihins. Raskolnikov is initially sullen and isolated, disliked by fellow prisoners, who call him an ""infidel"" and a ""gentleman"" unsuitable for ax-murder. However, the prisoners grow fond of Sonia, calling her ""little mother.""

Raskolnikov falls seriously ill and is hospitalized. During his feverish delirium, he dreams of a plague from Asia, causing madness and destruction, with only a few chosen ones surviving. This dream deeply troubles him. After recovering, he notices he misses Sonia's visits.

One warm spring morning, by the Irtish river, Sonia appears and sits beside him. He is suddenly overcome by emotion, falls at her feet, and weeps. Sonia, at first frightened, then understands his love and feels immense happiness. They embrace, both pale and thin, but now filled with hope for a new life. Raskolnikov feels his crime and punishment are external facts, and ""life had stepped into the place of theory."" He picks up Sonia's New Testament, which she had given him and from which she had read the story of Lazarus. He thinks about her convictions and her feelings.

The story concludes, stating this is the beginning of a new narrative: Raskolnikov's gradual renewal and regeneration into a new, unknown life, for which he will have to strive and suffer, but which will be filled with love."
Death in Venice-Thomas Mann,"On a spring afternoon in 19--, Gustav Aschenbach, a renowned writer officially known as von Aschenbach after his fiftieth birthday, takes a long walk in Munich. Overwhelmed by his demanding work, which has prevented him from achieving his usual midday restorative sleep, he seeks fresh air and movement. While waiting for a tram at the North Cemetery, near a silent Funeral Hall, he observes a man of unusual, almost savage appearance: red-haired, pug-nosed, with prominent teeth and a bold, commanding bearing. Aschenbach feels an uncomfortable military stare from the stranger and turns away.

Shortly after, Aschenbach is seized by a powerful, almost hallucinatory desire for travel, a ""roving unrest"" and ""youthful longing."" He envisions a tropical swampland, full of exotic, dangerous life. This yearning is an urge to escape his rigorous work, which, despite his love for it, has left him weary and creatively blocked, feeling his recent productions lack ""fiery and fluctuating emotionalism."" He decides a short, three-to-four-week break at a southern resort is necessary. As he boards the tram, he looks for the stranger but finds he has vanished.

The narrative then delves into Aschenbach's background. He is a celebrated author known for his epic ""Frederick of Prussia,"" the fictional tapestry ""Maya,"" the moral tale ""The Wretch,"" and a treatise on ""Art and the Spirit."" From a family of severe, disciplined officials, he inherited a strong will, but from his Bohemian mother, a more sensuous nature. Despite a frail constitution, he achieved fame early through relentless discipline and meticulous work, which he believed was a constant ""battle."" He developed a hero-type characterized by ""intellectual and youthful masculinity"" facing adversity with stoic grace, a reflection of his own life of ""self-mastery"" over inner decay. In his maturity, he moved away from youthful skepticism towards dignity, even rejecting knowledge that could cripple the will, which he associated with a ""miracle of reborn ingenuousness."" This period coincided with an ""excessive strengthening"" of his feeling for beauty, leading to a classical, formal style that was even adopted in school readers. He was ennobled on his fiftieth birthday. A widower with a married daughter, he lived a respectable middle-class life in Munich. Physically, he is described as somewhat short, dark, with thinning grey hair, gold spectacles, and a face marked by the ""imaginary and spiritual adventures"" of his art, showing ""lasting voluptuousness, over-refinement, fatigue, and curiosity of the nerves.""

Two weeks after his Munich walk, Aschenbach finally departs, taking a night train to Trieste, then a ship to Pola. His initial stop at a well-known Adriatic island disappoints him due to persistent rain, a heavy atmosphere, and the lack of a sandy beach. Feeling restless, he abruptly decides his true destination is Venice. He leaves the island after a week and a half, taking a motorboat to a naval port, then boarding a decrepit, sooty Italian steamer bound for Venice. A grotesque, theatrical booking agent processes his ticket. On deck, Aschenbach observes the passengers, including a group of boisterous young clerks. He is horrified to realize one of them, a primped-up ""youth"" in a bright yellow suit, is actually an old man with painted cheeks, a wig, false teeth, and dyed facial hair, yet his companions accept him without question. Aschenbach feels a ""dream-like estrangement.""

The ship sails under a grey, damp sky. Aschenbach eats a poor meal and continues to feel the dreariness. As the ship approaches Venice, he is struck by the ""blinding composition of fantastic buildings"" and feels this is the only proper way to approach the ""most unreal of cities."" At the lagoon, the ship waits for a health department barque. The old dandy from the ship, now painfully drunk, attempts to bid Aschenbach farewell, his false teeth falling out as he mumbles about a ""sweetheart."" Aschenbach again experiences a sense of the world distorting into the grotesque.

Upon disembarking, Aschenbach requests a gondola to take him to the Lido steamer dock. The gondolier, a brutal-looking man who seems non-Italian and has no visible license, insists on taking him directly to the Lido, claiming the _vaporetto_ (public steamer) won't take luggage. Aschenbach, despite irritation at the man's insolence, is lulled by the gondola's motion and his own inertia. He vaguely considers the gondolier a criminal but is too passive to resist. When he asks the fare, the gondolier merely says, ""You will pay."" Aschenbach, feeling strangely resigned, thinks of his money being taken or even being struck by an oar, yet relaxes in the thought that he is being rowed well. A boat of musical brigands briefly joins them, singing for money. When Aschenbach gets off at the Lido dock, the unlicensed gondolier vanishes before he can be paid, leaving Aschenbach to learn from a hotel employee that the man was known for operating without a license.

Aschenbach arrives at his Lido hotel and is shown to a pleasant room with a sea view. He reflects on how loneliness heightens perceptions, making the strange encounters on his journey profoundly disturbing. He greets the sea with pleasure. After tea and a walk, he dresses for dinner and observes the hotel guests. He is particularly drawn to a Polish family, specifically a boy of about fourteen. This boy, with honey-colored hair and a face recalling ""Greek sculpture of the noblest period,"" is ""absolutely beautiful."" His sisters are chastely dressed, but the boy is pampered, with long curls and a luxurious English sailor suit. Aschenbach, as an artist, feels a deep sympathy and reverence for such aristocratic beauty. He watches the boy and his family enter the dining hall, and for a moment, their eyes meet. After dinner, Aschenbach's thoughts on beauty and art are profound but ultimately feel empty. He sleeps, his dreams filled with ""apparitions.""

The next day, the weather remains dreary. Aschenbach feels depressed and contemplates leaving, recalling a past illness in Venice. However, at breakfast, he sees the Polish girls and their governess, and then Tadzio (as Aschenbach silently names him, deducing it from his playfellows' calls), who enters with an ""extraordinary charm"" and ""godlike beauty."" Aschenbach is ""astonished, terrified even."" On the beach, Aschenbach decides to stay, drawn by the ocean's allure for a weary artist. He observes Tadzio playing with other children, including a stocky boy named Jaschu. He notices a ""cloud of scorn and detestation"" on Tadzio's face when he passes the Russian family, which Aschenbach finds ""divinely arbitrary"" and charming. He later sees Tadzio swimming, emerging from the sea ""graceful and clean-cut... lovely as some frail god,"" a sight that evokes a ""sense of myth."" Aschenbach feels a ""paternal affection."" Back in his room, he examines his aging face. He sees Tadzio in the lift and notices the boy's ""jagged and pale"" teeth, concluding he is ""very frail, he is sickly"" and ""will not grow old""—a thought accompanied by a strange ""gratification.""

Later that afternoon, Aschenbach takes the _vaporetto_ to Venice. The oppressive heat, foul smells, and crowds sicken him, giving him a fever. He decides he must leave Venice, as the city's climate is unhealthy for him. He plans to go to another watering place. His gondola ride back to San Marco is frustrating, as the gondolier tries to steer him to shops. Back at the hotel, he announces his departure for the next morning. However, the next morning, despite the overcast sky, the air feels fresher, and he begins to regret his hasty decision, wishing he had delayed. He is irritated by the hotel staff's eagerness to rush him out. As he finally rises to leave, Tadzio enters the buffet room, and their eyes meet again. Aschenbach silently bids him farewell, then adds, ""God bless you!""

On the steamboat trip across the lagoon, Aschenbach is overwhelmed by regret and a ""spiritual hunger."" He realizes how deeply attached he is to Venice and the thought of never seeing it again is unbearable. He feels his physical defeat, which forced his departure, is dishonorable. At the station, his trunk is mistakenly sent to Como. Instead of being distressed, Aschenbach is seized by ""adventurous delight"" and ""unbelievable hilarity."" He declares he will not travel without his trunk and will return to the Lido hotel to await its return. He is back on the Grand Canal within minutes, returning to Venice, laughing at the comical twist of fate. He sees this as an opportunity to undo his ""grave error.""

Back at the hotel, he is given a similar room. He sits by the window, content to be back, but disapproves of his own ""irresolution."" He sees Tadzio returning from the sea and realizes with a ""conflict of pain and pleasure"" that Tadzio is why he found it so hard to leave. He performs a ""spontaneous act of welcome, of calm acceptance.""

In the following days, the weather turns sunny and delightful. Aschenbach settles in, enjoying the comfortable rhythm of life at the Lido. He finds himself in an almost ""Elysian"" state of blessed inactivity. He sees Tadzio constantly, on the beach, in the hotel, and during trips to the city. This daily presence of beauty makes his stay precious. He rises early to watch Tadzio on the beach, admiring his every movement. He connects Tadzio's ""godlike sculpture"" to his own artistic process, feeling he is seeing ""the beautiful itself, form as the thought of God."" He enters a state of ""drunkenness,"" reflecting on Socrates' philosophy of beauty as the ""sensitive man's access to the spirit."" Inspired, he begins writing again in Tadzio's presence, shaping his prose to reflect the boy's form. This ""rare creative intercourse between the spirit and a body"" yields a highly admired piece of writing, but leaves Aschenbach exhausted, his conscience ""complaining after some transgression.""

One morning, Aschenbach attempts to approach Tadzio on the beach, intending to strike up a friendly acquaintance, but his heart pounds, and he becomes short of breath and afraid of arousing suspicion. He passes the boy with bowed head, unable to speak. He immediately thinks ""Too late!"" but realizes he doesn't want ""soberness""; his ""intoxication was too precious."" He stops criticizing himself, sending for more money and dismissing thoughts of going home. He learns from the barber that the Polish family arrived only shortly before him. His sleep becomes fitful, filled with ""happy unrest."" He wakes at dawn, seeing the sunrise as the goddess Eros rising, and whispers Tadzio's name. He begins to see the world mythically, imagining Tadzio as Hyacinth, the youth loved by two gods.

An unspoken, intense relationship develops between Aschenbach and Tadzio, based solely on glances. Aschenbach notices Tadzio now habitually walks past his spot on the beach. Their eyes meet often; Aschenbach maintains dignity, but Tadzio's gaze is ""searching,"" then lowers, then returns with ""charming"" hesitation. One evening, as the Polish family returns from dinner in the city, Tadzio, looking paler, smiles at Aschenbach—an ""eloquent, familiar, charming"" smile, like Narcissus admiring his own reflection. Overwhelmed, Aschenbach flees to the dark park, whispering, ""I love you!""

In his fourth week, Aschenbach notices the hotel emptying. The barber inadvertently mentions ""the plague."" In Venice, Aschenbach detects a ""sweetish and drug-like"" odor everywhere, seeing municipal posters warning euphemistically about gastric diseases. A shop owner offers a vague explanation of police precautions due to the heat. Back at the hotel, newspapers confirm his suspicions: a cholera epidemic is being covered up by authorities to protect tourism. Aschenbach, feeling a ""dark contentment,"" recognizes this ""wicked secret"" of the city is entwined with his own. He fears Tadzio's departure, realizing he ""would not know how to go on living if this occurred.""

He begins to actively stalk Tadzio, following him through Venice's labyrinthine streets, even bribing a gondolier to pursue Tadzio's boat. He finds himself intoxicated by his ""illicit experience,"" rationalizing his passion as a form of heroism, like ancient warriors under Eros's yoke. He confronts the hotel manager about the disinfectants, receiving evasive answers. That evening, a band of street singers performs. The leader, a ""buffo baritone"" with a ""shabby felt hat"" and ""red hair,"" reminds Aschenbach of the stranger he saw in Munich. This singer's performance is vulgar, and he emits a ""strong carbolic smell."" Aschenbach again questions him about the disinfection, and the clown, with ""comical embarrassment,"" denies any plague, insisting it's just a precaution. Aschenbach understands the cover-up. He feels caught in a trance by the laughter, the hospital smell, and Tadzio's nearness. He believes Tadzio is sickly and won't live long, feeling a ""rakish gratification.""

The English travel agent finally confirms the devastating truth: Indian cholera, with an 80% fatality rate, is rampant in Venice. Authorities are suppressing the news, but panic is inevitable, and crime and debauchery are on the rise. He advises Aschenbach to leave immediately, before a quarantine. Aschenbach, now feverishly excited and triumphant in his knowledge, contemplates warning Tadzio's mother but ultimately decides against it. He whispers, ""It must be kept silent!"" and ""I will keep silent!"" The ""consciousness of his share in the facts and the guilt intoxicated him,"" and he embraces the ""advantages of chaos,"" choosing to remain.

That night, Aschenbach has a ""frightful dream"" of a Dionysian orgy, a raging mob of people and beasts, howling Tadzio's name. He resists at first, defending his ""intellectual poise and dignity,"" but is overcome by the tumult and the ""pungent smell of the bucks, the scent of moist bodies, and a waft of stagnant water"" mingled with the ""smell of wounds and prevalent disease."" He joins the revelers, his soul tasting ""the unchastity and fury of decay."" He awakens ""unnerved, shattered, and hopelessly under the power of the demon."" He no longer cares about appearances. Guests are fleeing, but Tadzio remains. Aschenbach feels laws of morality have fallen away.

Driven by a desire to please Tadzio, he tries to rejuvenate his appearance, adding youthful details to his dress, using perfumes, and visiting the hotel barber. The barber dyes his hair black, curls it, and applies cosmetics to his face, making him look young and vibrant. The barber states, ""Now the gentleman can fall in love unhesitatingly."" Aschenbach leaves, ""happy as in a dream,"" wearing a red necktie and a broad-brimmed straw hat.

A storm wind rises, bringing rain and the ""smell of things rotting."" Under the ""fever of his cosmetics,"" Aschenbach feels food is poisoned. He tracks Tadzio through the diseased city, becoming lost and exhausted. Tadzio, walking behind his companions, looks back at Aschenbach with his ""peculiarly dark-grey eyes,"" confirming he is being followed but not betraying him. Aschenbach is ""drunk with the knowledge of this,"" but eventually loses sight of Tadzio.

Exhausted, feverish, and trembling, Aschenbach buys and eats soft, over-ripe strawberries. He sits on the steps of a cistern in a quiet square, a place where he had once planned his flight. He, the dignified artist, author, and knighted figure, now a cosmetic-enhanced man, reflects on the Socratic dialogue, twisting it to conclude that the path of beauty is ""perilous,"" ""wrong and sinful,"" leading poets inevitably to ""intoxication and to desire,"" and ultimately to the ""precipice."" He concludes that ""mastery of our style is all lies and foolishness,"" and art's training is a ""precarious undertaking."" He sees knowledge itself as a precipice. He finishes his internal monologue with, ""And now I am going, Phaedrus. You stay here; and when you no longer see me, then you go too.""

A few days later, Aschenbach is unwell, experiencing vertigo and a sense of ""bafflement and hopelessness."" He learns Tadzio's family is leaving after lunch. He goes to the beach, which is now uninviting, like autumn. Tadzio is playing with his remaining companions. Jaschu, in a fit of anger, forces Tadzio into a wrestling match, pinning him down and almost strangling him by pressing his face into the sand. Aschenbach is about to intervene when Jaschu releases him. Tadzio, pale, rises and walks slowly to the water's edge, then onto a sand-bank, isolated from his companions and the shore. He turns and looks back. Aschenbach, watching, feels as though Tadzio is smiling and beckoning him ""towards egregious promises."" Aschenbach stands up to follow him.

Minutes later, Gustav von Aschenbach collapses in his chair. The same day, ""a respectfully shocked world received the news of his death."""
Don Quixote-Miguel de Cervantes,"The story begins by introducing a gentleman from a village in La Mancha, nearing fifty years of age, of hardy habit, lean, and a sportsman. He lives with a housekeeper, a niece, and a lad. This gentleman, whose surname is believed to be Quixada or Quesada, spends all his leisure time reading books of chivalry with such passion that he neglects his property, even selling land to acquire more of these books. He particularly enjoys the works of Feliciano de Silva. So consumed does he become that he loses his wits, believing the fantastical events in these books—enchantments, battles, loves—to be true.

His madness leads him to conceive the strangest notion: he decides to become a knight-errant himself, roaming the world in armor to right wrongs and achieve eternal renown. He envisions himself as Emperor of Trebizond. His first act is to clean his great-grandfather’s rusty armor, but he finds it lacks a closed helmet. Resourcefully, he constructs a pasteboard half-helmet, which, after breaking on a test and being reinforced with iron, he deems perfect. He then spends four days naming his old hack, Rocinante, a name he believes signifies its transformation into the foremost hack in the world. He then takes eight more days to name himself, settling on ""Don Quixote,"" and adds ""of La Mancha"" to honor his country, imitating famous knights. Finally, he realizes a knight-errant needs a lady to love. He chooses Aldonza Lorenzo, a local farm-girl he once admired (though she was unaware), and renames her ""Dulcinea del Toboso.""

With these preparations complete, Don Quixote sets out before dawn on a hot July morning. He immediately remembers he has not been dubbed a knight, a crucial step in chivalry. He resolves to be knighted by the first person he encounters. As he rides, he imagines a sage chronicling his deeds and addresses Dulcinea with passionate words. After traveling all day without incident, he spots an inn at nightfall, which he perceives as a magnificent castle. At the door, he sees two local girls whom he mistakes for fair maidens or ladies of the castle. When a swineherd's horn sounds, Don Quixote believes it's a dwarf announcing his arrival. He courteously addresses the laughing girls as ""ladyships."" The innkeeper, a fat man, comes out and, though amused by Don Quixote's appearance, speaks respectfully, offering lodging. Don Quixote, believing the innkeeper to be the ""castellan"" of a fortress, accepts with knightly phrases. He dismounts with difficulty and instructs the host to care for Rocinante. The girls help remove his armor, but his pasteboard helmet, tied with ribbons, cannot be removed. He remains helmeted while eating a meager supper of stockfish (which he perceives as trout) and bread, with one of the girls feeding him. He is still distressed about not being formally knighted.

Driven by this concern, Don Quixote kneels before the innkeeper, begging to be dubbed a knight. The innkeeper, realizing his guest's madness, decides to play along. He claims to have been a knight-errant himself, recounting a history of petty crimes, and explains that a chapel isn't necessary for the vigil of arms; the courtyard will suffice. He also advises Don Quixote to carry money, clean shirts, and ointment, as true knights secretly do. Don Quixote agrees. He places his armor on a trough by a well and begins his vigil. Later, two carriers attempt to move the armor to water their mules. Don Quixote, invoking Dulcinea, attacks the first, knocking him senseless. He then attacks a second, splitting his head. An uproar ensues, and the carriers stone Don Quixote, who, calling on Dulcinea, defends himself. The innkeeper intervenes, explaining Don Quixote is mad. To avoid further trouble, the innkeeper performs a burlesque knighting ceremony, reading from an account book, striking Don Quixote on the neck and shoulder, and having the two ""damsels"" (La Tolosa and La Molinera) gird on his sword and spur. Don Quixote, now formally a knight, expresses thanks with florid rhetoric, and the innkeeper, eager to be rid of him, lets him depart without payment.

Don Quixote leaves the inn, delighted with his new knighthood. Remembering the innkeeper's advice, he decides to return home for money, fresh clothes, and a squire. He plans to enlist a poor neighbor. Shortly after, he hears cries and finds a youth, Andres, stripped and being flogged by a farmer, Juan Haldudo. Don Quixote, enraged, calls the farmer a ""Discourteous knight"" and demands he pay Andres his overdue wages. He dismisses the farmer's claimed deductions and makes him promise on ""the order of knighthood"" to pay Andres. Don Quixote then rides off, believing he has righted a wrong. However, the farmer immediately re-ties Andres and flogs him more severely, mocking Don Quixote's intervention. Andres, weeping, vows to find Don Quixote and report the renewed abuse. Don Quixote, unaware, is deeply satisfied with his noble start.

He then encounters a group of Toledo traders. Imagining them to be knights, he challenges them to confess that Dulcinea is the fairest maiden. The traders, recognizing his madness, politely ask for a portrait. Don Quixote, furious at their effrontery, charges. Rocinante stumbles, and Don Quixote falls, unable to rise in his heavy armor. A muleteer beats him with his broken lance. The traders depart. Don Quixote, battered, attributes his fall to his horse and considers it a knight-errant's mishap. Unable to move, he recites a ballad about a wounded knight. A passing peasant from his village, Pedro Alonso, recognizes him and, seeing his delusion, carefully removes his helmet and helps him onto his ass. Don Quixote, now imagining himself to be the Moor Abindarraez, continues his chivalric ramblings. The peasant, realizing his neighbor is mad, hurries to the village.

At Don Quixote's house, they find the curate, the barber, the housekeeper, and the niece in distress over his three-day absence. The housekeeper and niece blame his books of chivalry. The peasant recounts Don Quixote's madness. Don Quixote, still delusional, claims bruises from a fight with giants. The curate and barber decide to wall up the book room and tell him a magician carried the books away. Two days later, Don Quixote discovers his library is gone. His niece and housekeeper tell him the sage Friston, his enemy, enchanted them away. Don Quixote, accepting this, believes Friston is persecuting him out of envy for his future victories.

After fifteen days of quiet, Don Quixote convinces his neighbor, Sancho Panza, a poor farm laborer, to become his squire, promising him an island to govern. Sancho, believing the promise, leaves his family. Don Quixote pawns property for money, repairs his helmet, and they set out at night. Sancho rides his ass, Dapple, eagerly anticipating his island. Don Quixote assures him he will soon win a kingdom.

They encounter a plain with thirty or forty windmills. Don Quixote declares them monstrous giants and charges. Sancho tries to tell him they are windmills, but Don Quixote dismisses his warnings, attributing Sancho's disbelief to fear. Don Quixote invokes Dulcinea and attacks a mill, shattering his lance and falling with Rocinante. Sancho helps him up. Don Quixote blames the sage Friston for transforming the giants into mills. Lamenting his broken lance, he vows to make a new one from an oak branch. He states that knights-errant are not permitted to complain of wounds, but allows Sancho to do so. Sancho eats from his saddlebags, and they spend the night under trees. Don Quixote makes a new lance.

The next day, Don Quixote warns Sancho not to interfere in battles with knights, only with ""rabble."" They then see two Benedictine friars on mules, followed by a coach with a Biscay lady. Don Quixote believes the friars are magicians abducting a princess. He charges, knocking one friar off his mule. The other flees. Sancho dismounts and begins stripping the fallen friar, claiming his gown as spoils. The friars' muleteers attack Sancho, beating him senseless. Don Quixote, oblivious, demands the lady in the coach go to El Toboso to present herself to Dulcinea. A Biscayan squire in the coach challenges Don Quixote. They fight. The Biscayan wounds Don Quixote, taking off part of his helmet and ear. Don Quixote, invoking Dulcinea, strikes the Biscayan, knocking him from his mule. The coach ladies beg Don Quixote to spare the squire. Don Quixote agrees, on condition that the Biscayan go to El Toboso and present himself to Dulcinea.

The narrator reveals he found the rest of the story in an Arabic manuscript by Cid Hamete Benengeli. He had it translated, and the text continues with the conclusion of the battle. Sancho, having recovered from his beating, praises Don Quixote's daring and asks for his promised island. Don Quixote explains this was only a ""cross-roads"" adventure, but promises a future island. Sancho expresses fear of the Holy Brotherhood. Don Quixote laments not having the balsam of Fierabras (the recipe of which he knows), which could cure any wound. Don Quixote, seeing his shattered helmet, swears an oath not to eat from a tablecloth or embrace his wife until he finds a new one. Sancho, ever practical, worries about finding a new helmet and points out the impracticality of such an oath. Don Quixote assures him they will find armor and that his will provides for Sancho's wages. They seek shelter, ending up near goatherds.

The goatherds welcome them and offer food. Don Quixote insists Sancho sit and eat with him, praising the honor of knight-errantry. Sancho, preferring to eat informally, is forced to sit. Don Quixote then delivers a long discourse on the Golden Age and the noble purpose of knight-errantry, reminding him of his duty to protect the weak. A goatherd, Antonio, sings a ballad of unrequited love. Another goatherd relates the story of Chrysostom, a student-shepherd who died of love for the beautiful, elusive shepherdess Marcela. Don Quixote is invited to the burial the next day.

At the burial site, they find shepherds preparing Chrysostom's grave. Ambrosio, Chrysostom's friend, intends to burn the deceased's love poems as per his will. Vivaldo, a traveler, argues against this, suggesting the poems should preserve Marcela's cruelty as a warning. Vivaldo reads a ""Lay of Despair"" from Chrysostom's papers. Marcela appears and defends herself, explaining her right to live freely and that Chrysostom's death was his own obstinacy, not her fault. Don Quixote forbids anyone from following her. The burial proceeds, and an epitaph is placed.

Don Quixote and Sancho search for Marcela, but find no trace. Resting in a glade, Rocinante tries to mate with some Yanguesan carriers' ponies, who beat him. Don Quixote and Sancho intervene but are severely beaten by the carriers with stakes. Sancho again asks for the balsam. Don Quixote, blaming himself for fighting non-knights, again promises the balsam. Sancho, in pain, argues for returning home, but Don Quixote insists on continuing. Sancho discovers his saddlebags (and money) are missing.

Later, Don Quixote mistakes two flocks of sheep for two vast armies and charges them. The shepherds stone him, breaking his teeth and his balsam flask. Don Quixote vomits balsam onto Sancho, who then vomits back onto his master. Sancho, again suffering, laments his lost saddlebags and considers leaving. Don Quixote, however, consoles him with philosophical reflections on fortune and the nature of battle wounds. They eventually reach an inn, which Don Quixote again mistakes for a castle. Maritornes, a serving girl, mistaking Don Quixote's bed for her lover's, enters his room. Don Quixote, believing her to be the lady of the castle, declares his love but reaffirms his fidelity to Dulcinea. The carrier, her true lover, becomes jealous, beats Don Quixote, and a general brawl erupts in the dark. A quadrillero (officer of the Holy Brotherhood) intervenes, believing Don Quixote is dead. The officer accidentally hits Don Quixote with a lamp. Don Quixote, still believing it's an enchanted castle, prepares his balsam. Sancho, also injured and given the balsam, suffers violently.

Don Quixote, recovered, refuses to pay the innkeeper, citing the laws of knight-errantry. Sancho, likewise refusing, is blanketed by other guests. Don Quixote, unable to intervene, vows vengeance.

After leaving the inn, Sancho, frustrated, suggests his master broke his oath. Don Quixote, after some argument, gives Sancho permission to speak freely. He decides to imitate Amadis of Gaul's penance, going mad in the Sierra Morena. Sancho recognizes this as another folly. Don Quixote reveals Dulcinea's true identity as Aldonza Lorenzo. Sancho, though knowing her, still tries to make Don Quixote believe her to be a great lady. Don Quixote writes a letter to Dulcinea and an order for three ass-colts for Sancho. Sancho departs after seeing Don Quixote perform a few mad capers.

Sancho meets the curate and barber, who had walled up Don Quixote's library. Sancho, despite trying to be secretive, reveals his master's madness and the details of Dulcinea's supposed enchantment. He realizes he lost Don Quixote's letter and the ass-colt order. The curate promises to renew the order. They decide to disguise themselves to lure Don Quixote home. The curate will be a distressed damsel, the barber her squire. Dorothea, a beautiful maiden from a nearby town, offers to play the damsel, as she is well-versed in chivalric tales. She has her own story to tell.

Dorothea, disguised as the Princess Micomicona of Ethiopia, explains her kingdom has been usurped by a giant, Pandafilando of the Scowl. Her late father prophesied Don Quixote would defeat the giant and marry her. Don Quixote, delighted, vows to help. Sancho is ecstatic, envisioning himself as a marquis, even if his vassals are black (he plans to sell them). Don Quixote, however, refuses marriage due to his fidelity to Dulcinea. Sancho, enraged, argues with his master, leading Don Quixote to beat him with his pike. Sancho retracts his words.

Suddenly, a group of guards appears with the notorious Gines de Pasamonte, who had stolen Dapple. Sancho reclaims his ass. Ricote, the Morisco shopkeeper from their village, is among the pilgrims with the guards. Ricote, disguised, tells Sancho how he was banished from Spain and returned to retrieve buried treasure. He offers Sancho money to help, but Sancho, loyal, refuses.

Cardenio, the madman, reappears and tells his story of love for Luscinda and betrayal by Don Fernando. Luscinda was forced to marry Don Fernando but feigned a swoon and revealed she was already married to Cardenio. Don Fernando left in a rage, and Luscinda fled to a convent. Don Fernando and his friends later found and abducted her. At the inn, Luscinda, Cardenio, Don Fernando, and Dorothea are unexpectedly reunited. Luscinda reaffirms her love for Cardenio, and Dorothea, kneeling before Don Fernando, reminds him of his promise to her. Moved by their arguments and tears, Don Fernando yields, embracing Dorothea and allowing Luscinda and Cardenio to be together.

The Duchess and Duke, having read Don Quixote's history, decide to play a joke on him. They instruct their majordomo to impersonate Merlin and stage a scene to disenchant Dulcinea. During a hunting trip, Sancho is terrified by a wild boar and ends up hanging from an oak tree. When night falls, the Duke's servants, disguised as demons and enchanters, stage a procession of carts. Merlin (the majordomo) appears on a triumphal car with a nymph (Altisidora, one of the Duchess's damsels). Merlin declares that Dulcinea will be disenchanted if Sancho receives 3,300 lashes on his bare buttocks. Sancho vehemently refuses, but Altisidora, feigning death and lamenting Don Quixote's coldness, pleads with him. Under pressure, Sancho agrees to the lashes, with conditions. Clavileño, a wooden horse, appears. Don Quixote and Sancho mount it, blindfolded, and are convinced they are flying through the air (they feel wind from bellows and heat from tow). The horse explodes, and they fall to the ground, singed. A parchment reveals that the adventure is complete, the duennas are shaved, and Dulcinea will be disenchanted upon completion of Sancho's whipping.

Don Quixote, believing in the enchantment, is pleased. Sancho, though, is annoyed by the ""flying"" and the whipping. The Duchess asks Sancho about his governorship. Sancho recounts his judgments, including the cases of the gold crowns in the stick, the pig dealer, and the tailor. He also tells of the letter he wrote to his wife, Teresa Panza, and the Duchess's reply. Sancho's government ends when a fake invasion forces him to wear two shields and a lance, making him immobile. He is trampled and then resigns, declaring himself unsuited for governing. He departs on Dapple, only to fall into a deep pit. Don Quixote, having also been the victim of another prank (cats and bells in his room), discovers Sancho in the pit and helps rescue him.

On their journey home, they encounter Don Álvaro Tarfe, a character from a spurious ""Second Part"" of Don Quixote's history. Don Álvaro confirms that our Don Quixote is not the one in his book. Don Quixote, to prove the other book a lie, makes Don Álvaro sign a declaration before a magistrate. Don Quixote then instructs Sancho on his final 3,000 lashes, which Sancho administers to trees rather than his own back.

They reach their village. Don Quixote interprets two boys' quarrel and a hare chase as bad omens. He meets the curate and bachelor Samson Carrasco, who, now aware of his defeat and year-long retirement, suggest he become a shepherd. Don Quixote, embracing this new madness, plans their pastoral life, giving them all shepherd names.

Don Quixote falls ill with a fever. His friends believe it's from melancholy over his defeat. A doctor confirms his physical decline. After a long sleep, Don Quixote wakes up sane. He denounces books of chivalry as absurd and deceitful, regretting his madness. He asks for a confessor and notary. He makes his will, forgiving Sancho all debts, stipulating that his niece should not marry a man who reads books of chivalry, and asking forgiveness from the author of the spurious ""Second Part."" He then dies peacefully in his bed, like a Christian. The notary records his natural death to prevent any false resurrection by other authors. Samson Carrasco writes epitaphs for Don Quixote, Dulcinea, Rocinante, and Sancho. Cid Hamete concludes the history, stating his purpose was to bring books of chivalry into detestation."
Dracula-Bram Stoker,"The provided text, a portion of the novel ""Dracula,"" details the harrowing experiences of Jonathan Harker in Transylvania and the subsequent efforts of his friends in England to combat a mysterious evil, culminating in a dramatic confrontation.

**Jonathan Harker's Ordeal in Transylvania:**
The story begins on **May 3**, with Jonathan Harker, an English solicitor, traveling by train through Europe to Transylvania. He notes the transition from Western to Eastern traditions. In Klausenburgh, he dines on ""paprika hendl"" and observes the local customs. Having researched Transylvania in London, he is aware of its wild nature and the numerous superstitions associated with the Carpathian Mountains.

Upon arriving in Bistritz on **May 4**, Harker checks into the Golden Krone Hotel, where he is expected by a letter from Count Dracula. The landlord and his wife react with fear when Harker inquires about the Count and his castle, crossing themselves and refusing to speak further. Before Harker departs, the old lady gives him a crucifix, warning him that the upcoming night is the ""eve of St. George’s Day"" when ""all the evil things in the world will have full sway."" Feeling uneasy but compelled by business, Harker accepts the crucifix.

On **May 5**, Harker boards a diligence (coach). His fellow passengers exhibit pity and make signs against the ""evil eye,"" using words like ""Satan,"" ""hell,"" ""witch,"" and ""were-wolf or vampire."" The journey is fast and wild through rugged mountains. As night falls, the passengers offer Harker gifts (charms against evil). At the Borgo Pass, the diligence driver attempts to send Harker away, claiming no carriage awaits him. However, a mysterious calèche with four black horses appears, driven by a tall, dark-bearded man whose eyes gleam red in the lamplight. A passenger whispers, ""For the dead travel fast."" This driver, later revealed to be Count Dracula himself, assists Harker into the calèche with prodigious strength.

The calèche then appears to drive in circles. Around midnight, dogs begin howling, followed by wolves. The horses panic, but the driver soothes them. They turn onto a narrow, dark road where snow begins to fall and the howling of wolves intensifies. The driver repeatedly stops to investigate flickering blue flames, which he explains are signs of hidden treasure. Once, Harker observes the driver standing between him and a flame without obstructing it, a ghostly flicker. When the driver is away from the carriage, a ring of wolves surrounds them, but the driver returns and, with a sweep of his arms, causes the wolves to retreat. The Count then drives Harker to a vast, ruined castle.

Inside the castle, the Count welcomes Harker, his handshake icy cold and unnaturally strong. Harker dines alone, the Count stating he has already eaten. Harker observes the Count's striking features: an aquiline nose, sharp white teeth that protrude, pointed ears, and an ""extraordinary pallor."" He notices hairs in the center of the Count's palms and long, sharp fingernails. When the Count's hands touch him, Harker feels a horrible nausea. As dawn breaks, Harker hears wolves and the Count calls them ""the children of the night.""

On **May 7**, Harker explores the castle, finding no servants, only evidences of great wealth but no mirrors. He deduces the Count performs all menial tasks, leading him to realize the Count was the calèche driver and controlled the wolves. He discovers all doors are locked, confirming he is a prisoner. The Count reveals he has been studying English through books, preparing for his move to London, and wants Harker to refine his English. He explains the blue flames were a sign of treasure in the Wallachian-Saxon-Turk battlegrounds, appearing on St. George's Eve, which cowardly peasants fear to seek.

On **May 8**, Harker cuts himself while shaving. The Count, appearing silently and without a reflection in the shaving glass, grabs at Harker's throat upon seeing the blood. The crucifix on Harker's neck causes an instant repulsion in the Count, whose fury quickly subsides. The Count then smashes the shaving glass, warning Harker about the dangers of cuts in this country, and departs. Harker realizes the castle is a prison.

On **May 12**, the Count asks Harker to write letters to his employer, Mr. Hawkins, and others, extending his stay for a month (until June 29), ensuring Harker will not expose him. Harker writes secret shorthand letters to Mina. The Count burns the shorthand letter, calling it ""vile.""

On **May 15**, Harker sees the Count crawl face-down like a lizard down the castle wall. Harker explores and finds a partially open door to another wing of the castle. Later, he witnesses three beautiful, shadowy women (who cast no shadows) approach him in his sleep. One, a fair woman, bends to kiss his throat. Suddenly, the Count appears in a rage, throwing the woman away and declaring Harker ""belongs to me!"" He promises the women they can ""kiss him at your will"" after he is done with Harker. He then throws a moving bag to them, from which Harker hears a ""gasp and a low wail, as of a half-smothered child,"" before the women and bag disappear through the window. Harker faints.

On **June 24**, Harker sees the Count leave the castle by the window, wearing Harker's clothes and carrying the terrible bag. Harker realizes the Count intends to impersonate him, making others believe Harker is still free and active in England. Later, the three ghostly women appear again as ""floating motes of dust"" in the moonlight, hypnotizing Harker until he breaks free, screaming. He then witnesses a woman in the courtyard crying, ""Monster, give me my child!"" The Count's voice calls, and wolves pour in, devouring the woman. Harker is filled with despair.

On **June 25**, Harker resolves to escape by scaling the castle wall. He successfully enters the Count's room, which is empty except for old gold and jewels. He finds a hidden passage leading to an old, ruined chapel where the Slovaks' large wooden boxes are stored. In one of the boxes, on newly dug earth, lies the Count. He is ""gorged with blood,"" appearing younger, with dark hair and mustache, full cheeks, ruby-red skin, and lips dripping with fresh blood. His eyes are open and hateful. Harker attempts to find a key on him but recoils from the Count's ""basilisk horror"" eyes. He strikes the Count's face with a shovel, inflicting a gash on his forehead, but the Count's eyes paralyze him. The lid falls back. Harker hears the Szgany and Slovaks arriving. He flees back to his room, but the doors are locked. He realizes the Count has left, taking the last box. He vows to climb the castle wall, take gold, and escape or die.

**Lucy Westenra's Decline and Death:**
Meanwhile, in England, Lucy Westenra, Mina Murray's friend, receives three marriage proposals on **May 24** from Dr. John Seward, Quincey P. Morris, and Arthur Holmwood. She accepts Arthur, whom she loves.

In **July and August**, Lucy is in Whitby with Mina. She begins sleepwalking, is often found pale and weak, and has two tiny, unhealing puncture marks on her throat. On **August 8**, a Russian schooner, the _Demeter_, arrives in Whitby during a fierce storm, with its dead captain lashed to the helm, holding a crucifix. An immense dog leaps from the ship and disappears. The ship's cargo is 50 wooden boxes of ""mould"" (earth) consigned to a solicitor in Whitby, Mr. S. F. Billington, for Carfax. The ship's log details the mysterious disappearances and deaths of the crew during the voyage, and the first mate's encounter with ""It, like a man, tall and thin, and ghastly pale"" that passed through his knife. The log ends with the captain tying himself to the wheel with a crucifix to save his soul from ""Him—It!"" A large dog is later found dead with its throat torn. On **August 10**, old Mr. Swales is found dead with a broken neck on Lucy and Mina's favorite seat in the churchyard, with a look of fear on his face. A dog howls mournfully during the captain's funeral, then cowers in terror when placed on the tombstone. On **August 14**, Mina sees Lucy sleepwalking, leaning out her window, with ""something that looked like a good-sized bird"" (a bat) on the sill, Lucy holding her hand to her throat.

Lucy's health deteriorates, becoming paler and weaker. On **August 17**, Mina notices the two tiny wounds on Lucy's throat are larger and have white edges. Unbeknownst to Mina, Mrs. Westenra (Lucy's mother) is dying of heart disease. The 50 earth boxes are delivered to Carfax.

Dr. Seward's patient, Renfield, a ""zoöphagous maniac"" in a lunatic asylum adjacent to Carfax, exhibits strange behavior. He consumes flies, spiders, and birds, believing he is absorbing their lives. His moods fluctuate dramatically, linked to the moon and the presence of ""the Master."" He escapes his room twice, going to the chapel at Carfax and professing loyalty to his ""Master."" Seward observes Renfield's ""unnatural strength.""

On **September 17**, Renfield attacks Dr. Seward with a knife, then licks Seward's blood, repeating ""The blood is the life!"" That same night, Lucy's mother, anxious about Lucy's stuffy room, removes a wreath of garlic flowers from Lucy's neck and opens the window. A great gaunt gray wolf crashes through the window. Mrs. Westenra cries out, tears away the remaining flowers, and falls dead from shock, her head hitting Lucy. Lucy, semi-conscious, sees ""little specks"" (the three women) blow in and remembers nothing more. The maids are drugged. Lucy writes a desperate memorandum, believing she is dying.

On **September 18**, Dr. Seward and Van Helsing break into Lucy's house, finding the drugged maids and Mrs. Westenra dead. They find Lucy ""horribly white and mangled,"" with the garlic flowers on her mother's bosom and her throat bare, showing the two enlarged, mangled wounds. Van Helsing declares Lucy needs an immediate blood transfusion. Arthur Holmwood arrives and gladly gives his blood. Van Helsing notices a red mark on Lucy's throat. He insists Seward watch Lucy all night, preventing sleep.

The next day, Lucy, despite her seeming recovery, exhibits strange behavior related to the garlic flowers, pushing them away when lethargic but clutching them when awake. Van Helsing is horrified to discover the wounds on Lucy's throat have ""absolutely disappeared."" Lucy soon dies, but not before, in a moment of ""sleep-waking,"" she voluptuously asks Arthur to kiss her. Van Helsing physically throws Arthur back, shouting, ""Not for your life! not for your living soul and hers!"" A spasm of rage and sharp teeth is seen on Lucy's face.

Van Helsing reveals that Lucy is ""Un-Dead,"" a vampire, and must be destroyed. He explains that if Arthur had kissed her, he too would become ""nosferatu."" He proposes to drive a stake through her heart and cut off her head. Arthur is initially horrified but agrees to the gruesome task to free Lucy's soul. That night, in the churchyard, Lucy appears as a ""dim white figure"" holding a child. She flings the child away callously and attempts to lure Arthur, but Van Helsing repels her with a crucifix. She then passes through the narrow crack in her tomb door. The next night, Arthur, Quincey, Seward, and Van Helsing gather. Arthur, with a stake and hammer, performs the ritual. Lucy's body writhes, screams, and champs its teeth, but then transforms into her former beautiful self, with a look of peace. Her body then crumbles to dust. Van Helsing, with Seward, then cuts off her head and fills her mouth with garlic, sealing the coffin.

**The Hunt for Dracula:**
Jonathan Harker, recovering from his brain fever in Buda-Pesth, marries Mina. He gives her his diary, which she types. Mina reads Jonathan's journal and then Seward's phonograph diary, realizing the terrible truth about Count Dracula. She is horrified but determined to help. She also learns of the Hampstead ""bloofer lady"" incidents, where children are found with punctured throats.

Van Helsing, now in London, gathers their group: Jonathan and Mina Harker, Dr. Seward, Lord Godalming (Arthur), and Quincey Morris. He explains the nature and powers of vampires, including their weaknesses: they cannot enter a place uninvited, their power ceases at daybreak, they can only change form at specific times (noon, sunrise, sunset), they cannot cross running water except at slack or flood tide, and they are repelled by garlic, crucifixes, wild rose, and sacred wafers. A stake through the heart or decapitation destroys them, turning them to dust. He reveals the Count is indeed Voivode Dracula.

The group discovers that 21 of the 50 earth boxes have been moved from Carfax. They visit Carfax and find the old chapel infested with rats, which are driven away by Lord Godalming's terriers. They ""sterilize"" the remaining 29 boxes by placing pieces of Sacred Wafer (the Host) in each. Mina is marked by the Sacred Wafer on her forehead, which sears her flesh, causing her to scream, ""Unclean! Unclean!"" The mark signifies her partial contamination by the Count.

Mina, in a hypnotic trance induced by Van Helsing, reveals that the Count has escaped London by ship (the _Czarina Catherine_) to Galatz (not Varna as previously believed, due to a deceptive invoice). He is taking his last earth-box with him, heading for the Danube. Mina, through her trance, describes hearing lapping waves, creaking masts, and other sounds indicating he is still at sea.

The group devises a plan. Jonathan, Arthur, and Van Helsing (who will protect Mina) will pursue the Count by river (the Sereth and Bistritza) on a steam launch, while Dr. Seward and Quincey Morris will follow on horseback along the riverbanks. Mina insists on accompanying them, as her hypnotic abilities can track the Count's movements and she feels safer with them. Before they leave, she extracts a solemn promise from all the men: if she ever becomes a full vampire, they must kill her by staking and decapitation. Jonathan reads the Burial Service over her.

The pursuit is arduous. Jonathan and Arthur on the launch find it difficult in the rapids. Seward and Quincey on horseback face cold and snow. Van Helsing and Mina travel by carriage. On **November 5**, Van Helsing leaves Mina in a ""Holy circle"" created with Sacred Wafer, which repels the three vampire women (who materialize from mist and snow, calling Mina ""sister""). He then enters Dracula's castle, finds the three vampire women's tombs, and, though repulsed by their beauty, destroys them by staking and decapitation, causing their bodies to crumble to dust. He places Sacred Wafer in Dracula's empty tomb, effectively banishing him from his home. He returns to Mina, who is pale but pure.

As the sun sets on **November 6**, the entire party converges on a cart of gypsies transporting the Count's last earth-box. Jonathan, Arthur, Seward, Quincey, Van Helsing, and Mina all confront the gypsies. Jonathan and Quincey fight their way to the cart. Quincey is mortally wounded by a gypsy knife, but, with Jonathan, they manage to open the box. Inside lies the Count, deathly pale, his eyes glaring with hate, but turning to triumph as he sees the setting sun. Just as the sun dips below the horizon, Jonathan's Kukri knife shears through the Count's throat, and Quincey's bowie knife plunges into his heart. The Count's body instantly crumbles into dust, a look of peace on his face in his final moment.

Quincey Morris, smiling, dies with his hand on Mina's forehead, declaring, ""The snow is not more stainless than her forehead! The curse has passed away!"" The castle of Dracula looms against the red sky. The gypsies flee. The wolves follow.

The plot concludes with the destruction of Count Dracula and the liberation of Lucy's soul, as well as Mina's. Quincey Morris sacrifices his life to achieve this."
Frankenstein-Mary Shelley,"The narrative begins with **Robert Walton**, an English explorer, writing letters to his sister, Mrs. Saville, from St. Petersburgh. He is preparing for a daring voyage to the North Pole, driven by a thirst for discovery and glory. He details his preparations and desire for a friend to share his intellectual pursuits, expressing a deep longing for companionship.

Walton's ship becomes trapped in ice near the North Pole. During this time, they witness a massive, man-like figure on a dog-drawn sledge speeding across the ice. The next morning, they discover another sledge, also on a large fragment of ice, containing a nearly frozen and emaciated European man. This man, who speaks English with a foreign accent, is taken aboard after he confirms the ship's northern destination. Walton nurses him back to health and finds himself captivated by the stranger, who is both melancholy and eloquent. The stranger reveals he is pursuing someone who fled from him, and when Walton's lieutenant mentions seeing a similar sledge with a gigantic man the day before, the stranger's attention is piqued, confirming his pursuit. Walton grows fond of the stranger, seeing in him the friend he longed for.

The stranger, identified as **Victor Frankenstein**, eventually agrees to tell his story to Walton, warning him against the dangerous pursuit of knowledge and suggesting his tale might serve as a moral lesson.

**Victor Frankenstein's Narrative:**

Victor begins by recounting his privileged Genevese upbringing. His father, Alphonse, a respected public figure, married Caroline Beaufort, the daughter of his impoverished friend. Victor, born in Naples, was their eldest child, showered with affection. When he was five, his mother adopted **Elizabeth Lavenza**, a beautiful orphaned girl of noble Milanese descent, presenting her to Victor as a ""present."" Victor grew up believing Elizabeth was his to cherish. Later, his close friend **Henry Clerval**, a talented and imaginative boy, joined their circle.

Victor's early intellectual pursuits were sparked by old alchemists like Cornelius Agrippa, Paracelsus, and Albertus Magnus, leading him to dream of discovering the ""elixir of life"" and making man invulnerable. However, a violent thunderstorm at age fifteen, which shattered an oak tree, redirected his interest towards modern science, specifically electricity and galvanism, making his previous alchemical studies seem obsolete.

At seventeen, Victor left for the University of Ingolstadt. Before his departure, Elizabeth contracted scarlet fever, and his mother, Caroline, died after nursing her back to health, extracting a deathbed promise from Victor and Elizabeth to marry. Victor's journey to Ingolstadt was delayed by grief. There, he initially disdained M. Krempe, a professor of natural philosophy, but was inspired by M. Waldman, a chemistry professor, whose praise of modern science's ""unlimited powers"" ignited in Victor a fervent desire to uncover the ""deepest mysteries of creation.""

Victor dedicated himself to natural philosophy and chemistry for two years, making rapid progress. His particular focus became the ""principle of life."" He delved into anatomy and observed human decay, eventually discovering the secret of bestowing ""animation upon lifeless matter."" Driven by ambition and a desire to create a new species that would bless him as its creator, he secretly began constructing a human being. To facilitate his work, he decided to make it of gigantic stature, about eight feet tall. He collected materials from dissecting rooms and charnel-houses, becoming emaciated and nervous, neglecting his family and health.

On a ""dreary night of November,"" Victor successfully animated his creation. However, the sight of the creature's ""dull yellow eye"" opening and its convulsive motions instantly filled him with ""breathless horror and disgust."" Despite having chosen beautiful features, the resulting being was hideous. Victor fled his apartment. Tormented by nightmares, he was later startled to find the creature standing over his bed, reaching out a hand. He again fled, passing the night in agitated wandering.

The next morning, Henry Clerval arrived in Ingolstadt, uplifting Victor's spirits. Victor, fearing Clerval would see the creature, rushed to his apartment, finding it empty. Overcome by relief and intense emotions, Victor succumbed to a nervous fever that lasted several months. Henry nursed him, hiding the true extent of his illness from his family. In his delirium, Victor constantly raved about the monster, leading Henry to suspect a terrible event.

Upon his recovery, Victor received a letter from Elizabeth, detailing family news: his father was well, his brother Ernest was growing up, and **Justine Moritz**, a beloved servant who had been part of their family, had returned to live with them after the death of her own mother. Elizabeth also mentioned little William, now a ""sweet child.""

Victor recovered his health and spirits, finding solace in new studies with Clerval, specifically Oriental languages, which he pursued to distract himself from his past. His return to Geneva was delayed until spring. They took a walking tour, and Victor's joy was almost fully restored.

However, a letter from his father then arrived with devastating news: William had been brutally murdered. His father described finding William's body with ""the print of the murderer's finger on his neck."" Elizabeth, who had given William a valuable miniature of Victor's mother, blamed herself as the miniature was missing, presumed stolen by the murderer. Victor, instantly realizing the creature was the killer, was consumed by despair. During a thunderstorm near Geneva, he saw the gigantic form of his creature and was convinced of its guilt. Yet, he decided to remain silent, fearing his story would be dismissed as madness.

Upon reaching home, Victor learned that Justine Moritz was accused of William's murder. Ernest explained that the miniature had been found in Justine's pocket. Victor vehemently declared Justine's innocence, knowing the true murderer. Elizabeth also staunchly defended Justine, but Justine, after being tormented by her confessor, confessed to the crime, hoping for absolution. Victor and Elizabeth visited Justine in prison, where Justine tearfully recanted her confession, explaining she had been pressured. Elizabeth and Victor believed her, but Justine was condemned and executed. Victor was overwhelmed by guilt, recognizing himself as the true murderer of William and Justine.

Consumed by remorse and suicidal thoughts, Victor sought solace in the Alps. During an ascent of Montanvert, he encountered his creature. Victor furiously denounced him as a ""devil"" and ""vile insect"" and attempted to fight him. The creature easily eluded him and, in turn, reproached Victor for his abandonment and hatred. The monster declared that his misery made him malicious and swore ""everlasting war against the species, and more than all, against him who had formed me."" He pleaded with Victor to hear his story, claiming that if Victor provided him with a companion, he would retreat from humanity and become harmless. Victor, recognizing his duties as a creator and fearing the monster's threats, reluctantly agreed to create a female companion, on the condition that they leave Europe forever.

**The Creature's Narrative:**

The creature then began his own story, detailing his confused awakening, his initial helplessness, and his slow process of learning about the world through his senses. He learned to control fire, which he discovered accidentally, and to distinguish objects. He was terrified when humans shrieked and attacked him at a shepherd's hut and a village. He found refuge in a hovel next to a cottage inhabited by the benevolent De Lacey family: a blind old man, his daughter Agatha, and his son Felix.

From his hovel, the creature secretly observed the family, learning their language and their routines. He discovered their poverty and secretly helped them by providing wood. He learned about human society, history, and the concepts of virtue and vice from Felix's lessons to a foreign woman named Safie. Safie's arrival brought joy to the De Lacey family, and her story, of being the daughter of a Turkish merchant rescued by Felix from unjust imprisonment in Paris, further immersed the creature in human affairs. He learned that Felix and his family were ruined and exiled due to Felix's efforts to help Safie's father, who then betrayed them. Safie, refusing to return to Turkey, found her way to Felix.

The creature found a portmanteau containing books (*Paradise Lost*, *Plutarch's Lives*, *The Sorrows of Werter*) and, crucially, Victor's journal, which minutely detailed his own creation. Reading these, he saw himself as a ""monster"" and a ""blot upon the earth."" He identified with Adam as a solitary creation but also with Satan, filled with envy at the bliss of the De Laceys. He became filled with despair at his hideous deformity, but still hoped that the De Laceys' benevolent nature would allow them to overlook his appearance.

He decided to introduce himself to the blind old man first. One day, while the others were out, he entered the cottage. De Lacey, unable to see his appearance, listened kindly as the creature spoke of being a friendless, unfortunate outcast seeking protection. As the creature was about to reveal his identity, Felix, Safie, and Agatha returned. Their reactions were immediate horror; Agatha fainted, Safie fled, and Felix violently attacked him. Overcome with ""pain and anguish,"" the creature fled.

Rejected, the creature's ""mildness of nature had fled,"" replaced by ""rage and revenge."" He declared ""everlasting war against the species."" That night, he burned down the De Laceys' cottage. He then resolved to seek out Victor, his creator, from whom he demanded pity and redress. He journeyed towards Geneva, traveling only at night. On the way, he attempted to save a drowning girl, but the rustic accompanying her, upon seeing him, shot him and fled. This act of violence further solidified his hatred for mankind.

He reached Geneva and, seeing William, approached him, hoping the child's innocence would allow for companionship. But William, terrified, called him a ""monster"" and threatened to tell ""M. Frankenstein."" Enraged at the sound of his creator's name, the creature strangled William, exulting in the act of creating ""desolation"" for Victor. He then took a miniature from William's body and planted it in the dress of the sleeping Justine Moritz, thus framing her for the murder. The creature concluded his tale by demanding Victor create a female companion for him, vowing that he would then disappear from human society forever.

**Victor's Narrative (continued):**

Victor initially refused to create another creature, fearing their combined wickedness would desolate the world. The monster then threatened to unleash unimaginable horrors on Victor's remaining friends if his demand was not met. He argued that his malice stemmed from his misery and solitude, and that a companion would restore his benevolence. Swayed by the monster's arguments and threats, Victor reluctantly consented, on the condition that the creatures leave Europe permanently.

Victor delayed starting the work, filled with repugnance. His father, noticing his melancholy, suggested an immediate marriage to Elizabeth. Victor, remembering the monster's threat to ""be with you on your wedding-night,"" believed he was the intended victim. He agreed to the marriage, seeing it as sealing his own fate but potentially protecting Elizabeth by making himself the sole target. He arranged to travel to England, ostensibly for scientific study, to complete the new creation. Henry Clerval accompanied him.

In England and Scotland, Victor gathered materials, tormented by his task. On a remote Orkney island, he began to assemble the female creature. However, he stopped, reflecting on the potential dangers: the female might be more malicious, refuse the compact, or they might reproduce, creating a ""race of devils."" He shuddered at the thought of inflicting such a curse on mankind. At that moment, he saw the monster watching him through a window, grinning. Filled with rage and a renewed sense of the wickedness of his promise, Victor tore the half-finished creature to pieces. The monster, howling in ""devilish despair and revenge,"" withdrew.

Later that night, the monster confronted Victor, enraged by the destruction of his hopes. He renewed his threat: ""I will be with you on your wedding-night."" Victor attempted to seize him, but the monster escaped by boat.

Victor disposed of the female creature's remains at sea. He was then caught in a storm, driven far from shore, and eventually landed in Ireland. There, he was immediately arrested and accused of murder. Brought before Magistrate Kirwin, he learned the victim was Henry Clerval, who had been strangled, with finger marks on his neck. Victor collapsed in convulsions and fell into a fever, confessing in his delirium to the murders of William, Justine, and Clerval. Kirwin, finding letters on Victor, contacted his father.

Victor's father arrived. Victor was eventually acquitted of Clerval's murder because it was proven he was on the Orkney Islands at the time. Despite his release, Victor remained in deep despair, haunted by the specter of the monster and the deaths he caused. His father tried to console him, but Victor confessed to him that he was the murderer of William, Justine, and Henry, which his father dismissed as delirium.

Victor received a letter from Elizabeth, expressing her love and concern about their marriage, asking if he truly loved her. Victor, still fixated on the monster's threat against him on their wedding night, decided to proceed with the marriage, believing his own death was inevitable and would protect Elizabeth. He wrote back, promising to reveal a ""dreadful secret"" the day after their union.

They returned to Geneva, and the marriage was set. Victor took precautions, carrying pistols and a dagger, as they traveled to their estate at Evian for their wedding night. Elizabeth, sensing evil, was melancholy, while Victor remained outwardly cheerful to deceive his father.

On their wedding night, in the inn at Evian, Victor, pistol in hand, awaited the monster, believing himself to be the target. He sent Elizabeth to her room. Suddenly, he heard her ""shrill and dreadful scream."" He rushed in to find Elizabeth ""lifeless and inanimate,"" strangled by the monster. The monster appeared at the window, grinning and pointing at Elizabeth's corpse. Victor fired a pistol, but the monster escaped into the lake.

Victor collapsed in agony. His father, upon hearing the news, died of grief a few days later in Geneva. Victor, deemed mad, was imprisoned for several months. Upon his release, consumed by vengeance, he attempted to enlist a criminal judge to hunt the monster, but the judge found his story incredible. Victor, enraged, vowed to pursue the monster himself.

**Victor's Narrative (concludes):**

Victor left Geneva, abandoning his homeland, and swore an oath of vengeance over the graves of his family. The monster, having followed him, laughed hideously and whispered that he was ""satisfied."" Victor pursued the monster for months across Europe, Russia, and Tartary, guided by clues the creature deliberately left. He endured immense hardships in the frozen wilderness, sustained by his burning desire for revenge. He obtained a sledge and dogs and began to gain on the monster in the Arctic. He eventually caught sight of the monster's sledge, but a ground sea caused the ice to split, separating them. Adrift and near death, Victor was then found by Walton's ship.

Victor finishes his tale to Walton, reaffirming his pursuit of the monster. He begs Walton to continue his quest for vengeance after his death, warning him against the monster's deceptive eloquence and urging him to ""thrust your sword into his heart."" Victor dies shortly after, with a gentle smile on his lips.

**Walton's Continuation (Conclusion):**

Walton is interrupted by a sound from Frankenstein's cabin and finds the monster hanging over Victor's coffin, weeping. The monster confesses that Victor's murder, by destroying all he loved, has ""consummated"" his crimes and brought his ""miserable series of being"" to a close. He explains his actions stemmed from the ""impotent envy and bitter indignation"" he felt when Victor sought happiness while denying him a companion and thus condemning him to solitude. He admits his crimes degraded him, turning him into a ""malignant devil,"" but insists he was driven by rejection and misery. He expresses profound self-loathing, stating his abhorrence for himself is greater than any other's. He declares his work is complete, and he will now commit suicide by building a funeral pyre at the northernmost point of the globe and consuming himself in flames, leaving no trace to inspire another ""unhallowed wretch"" to create such a being. He bids farewell, leaps from the cabin window onto an ice raft, and is quickly borne away into the darkness and distance."
Great Expectations-Charles Dickens,"The story begins with Philip Pirrip, who calls himself Pip, an orphan living in the marsh country with his much older sister, Mrs. Joe Gargery, and her husband, Joe, the blacksmith. Pip's parents and five infant brothers are deceased, their tombstones in the local churchyard. One raw afternoon, while visiting the graves, Pip is accosted by a fearful, coarse-clothed man with an iron on his leg, an escaped convict. The convict threatens Pip with death, claiming he has a ""young man"" accomplice, and demands a file and food (""wittles"") be brought to him early the next morning at an old battery on the marshes. Terrified, Pip agrees, fearing for his life.

Back home on Christmas Eve, Pip's guilt over the impending theft weighs heavily on him. His sister, Mrs. Joe, is a harsh woman who has raised him ""by hand"" (often hitting him with a cane called ""Tickler""), while Joe is a kind, mild-mannered man. Joe and Pip share a bond as fellow sufferers under Mrs. Joe's temper. Pip secretly stashes his bread and butter in his trousers for the convict, which Joe notices, leading to Mrs. Joe's angry interrogation and dosing of them both with foul-tasting tar-water. That evening, Pip hears cannon fire, signifying another escaped convict from the nearby prison-ships, or ""Hulks."" He is plagued by thoughts of the convict and his ""young man"" tearing out his heart and liver. Before dawn, Pip steals bread, cheese, mincemeat, brandy, a meat bone, and a pork pie from the pantry, and a file from Joe's forge, then hurries to the misty marshes.

At the battery, Pip first encounters a different man, also a convict, who curses at him and flees. Pip realizes this must be the ""young man"" the first convict mentioned. Soon after, he finds his original convict, shivering and ravenous. Pip gives him the food and file. The convict devours the food, drinking the brandy Pip brought. Pip mentions seeing the other convict, startling the man, who furiously files at his own leg-iron, believing the other is pursuing him. Pip, fearing the convict's rage, slips away.

Returning home, Pip finds the robbery undiscovered, as Mrs. Joe is preoccupied with Christmas dinner preparations for guests: Mr. Wopsle (the church clerk), Mr. and Mrs. Hubble, and Uncle Pumblechook (a cornchandler and Joe's uncle). Pip feels out of place and ashamed of his commonness. During dinner, the guests repeatedly criticize Pip and his upbringing. When Pumblechook drinks the brandy Pip had refilled with tar-water, he suffers a violent, comical fit, leading Pip to believe he has poisoned him. Mrs. Joe then prepares to serve the stolen pork pie. Just as Pip realizes the pie will be discovered, soldiers arrive at the door.

The soldiers' arrival causes a commotion. The sergeant explains they need Joe to mend a pair of handcuffs for two escaped convicts. Joe, the blacksmith, agrees, and the soldiers wait. Pip is relieved the handcuffs are not for him. He overhears the sergeant discussing the search for the convicts on the marshes. Joe fixes the handcuffs. Pip, Joe, and Mr. Wopsle accompany the soldiers on the hunt. In the dark, sleety marshes, they hear shouts and eventually find the two convicts fighting in a ditch. Pip's convict boasts he caught the other and dragged him back to justice. The other convict, severely mauled, accuses Pip's convict of attempted murder. Pip's convict, Magwitch, is then taken into custody. In a hut, Magwitch confesses to stealing food and a pie from ""the blacksmith's,"" surprising Joe, who compassionately states he is welcome to it. Magwitch is then taken to a prison-ship (Hulk).

After Magwitch's departure, Pip is tormented by guilt and shame, particularly towards Joe, whom he feels he has wronged. He fears confessing the truth would make Joe think him worse. Mrs. Joe and the guests speculate on how the convict broke into the house, with Pumblechook offering an elaborate, incorrect theory. Pip begins to learn with Biddy, Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt's granddaughter, who teaches him to read and write. Joe, who cannot read, shares his sad childhood story of an abusive, alcoholic father and how he married Mrs. Joe because she took in Pip. Pip develops a new admiration for Joe, despite his earlier embarrassment.

Pip is later informed that Miss Havisham, the eccentric lady of Satis House, wants him to return. Pumblechook takes credit for this arrangement. Pip, after a harsh scrubbing by Mrs. Joe, accompanies Pumblechook to Miss Havisham's. Estella, Miss Havisham's beautiful but scornful adopted daughter, admits only Pip, dismissing Pumblechook. Inside the decaying Satis House, Pip finds Miss Havisham, a withered lady in a faded bridal gown, whose clocks and watch are stopped at twenty minutes to nine. Miss Havisham, who has not seen daylight since her wedding day, demands Pip ""play."" Estella treats Pip with disdain, calling him a ""common labouring-boy"" with ""coarse hands"" and ""thick boots,"" which makes Pip ashamed. Miss Havisham tells Pip to return in six days. Estella then gives Pip food as if he were a dog. Pip, humiliated, cries, and then has a momentary illusion of Miss Havisham hanging from a beam in the deserted brewery. He walks home, deeply dissatisfied with his life and status.

Pip continues to visit Miss Havisham every other day for many months, pushing her in a chair around her dusty rooms. She subtly encourages his admiration for Estella and frequently tells Estella to ""Break their hearts."" During this time, Pip also suffers the constant presence and patronizing remarks of Miss Havisham's grasping relatives (Mrs. Camilla, Cousin Raymond, Sarah Pocket, Georgiana), who resent Pip's attention. One day, Miss Havisham tells Pip he is growing too tall and should be apprenticed at once. She asks Joe to bring Pip's indentures. Mrs. Joe is enraged by this, but Joe complies. At Satis House, Joe, awkward and addressing only Pip, signs the indentures. Miss Havisham gives Pip twenty-five guineas as a premium, which Joe, addressing Pip, says he will not take for himself, as no money can compensate for losing Pip's ""little child"" self. Miss Havisham, as they leave, tells Joe this is Pip's reward and he should expect no more. Pip feels ashamed of Joe's commonness in Estella's presence. At Pumblechook's, Joe, with Pip's help, exaggerates the sum to Mrs. Joe and lets Pumblechook take credit for the premium. Pip is formally bound as Joe's apprentice, then attends a celebratory dinner where he is again humiliated.

Pip begins his apprenticeship at the forge, but is now ashamed of his home and trade, seeing it as ""coarse and common,"" a direct result of Estella's influence. He imagines Estella's scorn if she saw him working. He tries to improve himself by studying with Biddy, but his heart remains set on Estella. Joe's journeyman, Orlick, resents Pip and frequently clashes with Mrs. Joe. One day, a violent quarrel erupts between Orlick and Mrs. Joe, culminating in a fight between Joe and Orlick, which Joe wins. Mrs. Joe collapses, suffering a severe blow to the back of her head, leaving her with impaired sight, hearing, memory, and speech. The weapon found nearby is a filed-asunder convict's leg-iron. Pip suspects either Orlick or the strange man who showed him the file in the Three Jolly Bargemen. Biddy comes to live with them, becoming an invaluable helper. She deduces from Mrs. Joe's slate drawings that Orlick was the assailant, signified by a crude hammer symbol. Mrs. Joe, strangely, seems to want to conciliate Orlick afterwards.

Pip continues his annual visits to Miss Havisham, receiving a guinea each time. He observes Biddy's growing intelligence and kindness, contrasting her with Estella. He confesses to Biddy his desire to be a gentleman for Estella's sake, but Biddy wisely questions his motives, suggesting Estella is ""not worth gaining over."" Pip is angered by Biddy's realism. He travels to London for his ""great expectations."" There, he meets Mr. Jaggers, his guardian, a formidable lawyer whose office is filled with strange artifacts, including casts of the faces of hanged clients. Pip also encounters Jaggers's clerk, Wemmick, who has a peculiar ""post-office"" mouth and separates his professional life from his private life at his ""Castle"" in Walworth, where he lives with his deaf ""Aged Parent"" and courts Miss Skiffins. Pip finds his fellow student, Herbert Pocket (the pale young gentleman he fought), in London. They become friends, and Herbert reveals Miss Havisham's tragic story: she was jilted on her wedding day by a man named Compeyson, who conspired with her half-brother Arthur to swindle her. This event led her to stop all the clocks and live in eternal mourning.

Pip learns from Herbert that he is secretly engaged to Clara Barley and dreams of becoming a capitalist to marry her. Pip also incurs significant debt, mirroring Herbert's struggles. Pip and Herbert join ""The Finches of the Grove,"" an expensive club. Pip receives a letter from Trabb & Co. informing him of his sister, Mrs. Joe's, death. Pip returns home for the funeral, feeling remorse for his past ingratitude. Pumblechook, however, is overtly condescending and takes credit for Pip's past prosperity. Pip tells Biddy of his plan to leave Joe and marry her, only for Biddy to reveal she is marrying Joe, who has paid off Pip's debts. Heartbroken but understanding, Pip leaves. He sells his possessions, pays his creditors, and joins Herbert as a clerk in Clarriker & Co., a shipping-broker firm in Cairo. Years later, Pip becomes a partner, and Herbert learns of Pip's secret generosity in funding his initial partnership.

Eleven years pass. Pip, now an ""old bachelor"" and partner in the firm, returns to his hometown. He finds Joe, hale and strong, with a young son, also named Pip, sitting on Pip's old stool by the forge fire. Joe and Biddy are happily married. Pip walks with the young Pip to the churchyard, where the boy points out the family tombstones. Pip learns that Estella had led an unhappy life, separated from her cruel husband (Drummle), who died in an accident. Pip revisits the site of Satis House, now demolished, with only the garden wall remaining. He finds Estella there. Her beauty has faded, but her eyes now hold a ""saddened, softened light,"" and her touch is friendly. Estella tells him that suffering has ""bent and broken"" her ""into a better shape"" and that she now understands his heart. They agree to be friends and continue friends apart. The story ends with Pip taking Estella's hand as they walk out of the ruined place, with the evening mists rising, and he sees ""no shadow of another parting from her."""
Hamlet-William Shakespeare,"This detailed summary is based exclusively on the provided text of ""Hamlet, Prince of Denmark,"" and does not incorporate any external knowledge, literary analysis, or philosophical discussion.

**ACT I**

**Scene I: Elsinore. A Platform Before the Castle. Night.**
The play opens on a cold, bitter night on a platform before the castle at Elsinore. Francisco is on his guard post when Bernardo arrives to relieve him. Francisco expresses a feeling of being ""sick at heart."" Bernardo, Horatio, and Marcellus then gather. Marcellus asks Horatio if ""this thing"" has appeared again, but Horatio, a skeptic, dismisses it as ""fantasy."" Bernardo and Marcellus recount having seen an apparition twice before.

As Bernardo begins to describe the previous sightings, the Ghost appears, resembling the recently deceased King Hamlet, clad in the same warlike armor he wore when he battled Norway. Horatio is immediately struck with ""fear and wonder."" Urged by Marcellus, Horatio addresses the Ghost, demanding to know why it walks at night in the form of the ""buried Denmark"" and charges it to speak. The Ghost, however, stalks away without a word.

Horatio, now convinced of its reality, notes that its appearance bodes ""some strange eruption to our state,"" drawing a comparison to omens seen before the fall of Julius Caesar. The Ghost re-enters. Horatio, crossing its path, commands it to speak if it has a voice, if it can perform a good deed, if it knows of the country's fate, or if it guards hidden treasure. The Ghost seems on the verge of speaking but is abruptly startled by the crowing of a cock and vanishes. Horatio explains that spirits flee at the sound of the cock, which heralds the morning. He suggests they report what they have seen to young Hamlet, believing the spirit, silent to them, will speak to his son.

**Scene II: A Room of State in the Palace.**
King Claudius, addressing his court, acknowledges the recent death of his brother, King Hamlet. Despite the lingering grief, he states that ""discretion"" has led him to marry Queen Gertrude, his ""sometime sister, now our queen,"" a union he describes as a ""defeated joy."" He thanks the court for their concurrence in this matter.

He then grants Laertes, son of Polonius, permission to return to France, a request Polonius confirms he granted with ""hard consent."" Claudius turns to Hamlet, questioning his continued melancholic appearance (""How is it that the clouds still hang on you?""). Hamlet replies cryptically, ""A little more than kin, and less than kind,"" and ""I am too much i'the sun."" Queen Gertrude urges Hamlet to shed his ""nighted colour"" and accept that death is a common human experience. Hamlet insists his sorrow is deeply felt, ""I have that within which passeth show; These but the trappings and the suits of woe.""

King Claudius criticizes Hamlet's ""obstinate condolement"" as ""unmanly grief"" and ""impious stubbornness."" He asks Hamlet to consider him as a father, reminding him that Hamlet is ""the most immediate to our throne."" Queen Gertrude also pleads with Hamlet to stay in Denmark and not return to Wittenberg for his studies. Hamlet reluctantly agrees to obey his mother. The King and Queen exit with their retinue.

Alone, Hamlet expresses profound despair, wishing his flesh would melt or that God's law against suicide did not exist. He finds the world ""weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable,"" an ""unweeded garden."" He laments his father's death, which occurred less than two months prior, contrasting his noble father (""Hyperion to a satyr"") with his ""incestuous"" uncle, Claudius. He is disgusted by his mother's hasty marriage to his uncle, which followed so quickly after his father's funeral that the ""bak'd meats Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables."" He concludes, ""It is not, nor it cannot come to, good: But break, my heart, for I must hold my tongue!""

Horatio, Bernardo, and Marcellus enter. Hamlet, surprised and pleased to see Horatio, asks what brings them from Wittenberg. Horatio explains he came for King Hamlet's funeral, which Hamlet bitterly reframes as his mother's wedding. Horatio then cautiously reveals the purpose of their visit: they have seen the apparition of King Hamlet. Hamlet is incredulous and demands details. Horatio describes the armed figure, resembling the late king, seen thrice on watch. He confirms he spoke to it, but it remained silent, only motioning as if to speak before the cock crowed and it vanished. Hamlet, after confirming details of the ghost's appearance (armed, pale, sorrowful, with a ""sable silver'd"" beard), decides to join them on watch that night, determined to speak to the ghost ""though hell itself should gape."" He makes Horatio, Bernardo, and Marcellus swear to keep the sighting secret. Alone, Hamlet suspects ""foul play"" and resolves to await the night, believing ""Foul deeds will rise, Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes.""

**Scene III: A Room in Polonius's House.**
Laertes, preparing to embark for France, advises his sister Ophelia concerning Hamlet's declarations of love. He warns her to treat Hamlet's affections as fleeting, ""a fashion, and a toy in blood,"" because Hamlet, as a prince, cannot choose for himself, and his choice affects the ""safety and the health of the whole state."" He cautions her against believing his ""songs"" to protect her ""honour."" Ophelia promises to remember his advice but playfully warns him not to be a hypocrite by treading ""the primrose path of dalliance"" himself.

Polonius enters and chides Laertes for his delay. He then delivers a lengthy series of precepts to Laertes: don't voice all thoughts, be selective with friends, avoid quarrels but be fierce if in one, listen more than you speak, dress well but not ostentatiously, and neither borrow nor lend. He concludes with, ""This above all,--To thine ownself be true; And it must follow...Thou canst not then be false to any man."" Laertes departs, reminding Ophelia of his advice.

Polonius questions Ophelia about what Laertes discussed, specifically regarding Lord Hamlet. Ophelia admits Hamlet has made ""many tenders Of his affection."" Polonius dismisses Hamlet's advances as disingenuous ""springes to catch woodcocks"" and forbids Ophelia from having any further contact or communication with Hamlet. Ophelia meekly promises to obey.

**Scene IV: The Platform. Night.**
Hamlet, Horatio, and Marcellus stand watch. The bitter cold is noted. From the castle, trumpets and cannon fire indicate the King's late-night revelry, which Hamlet criticizes as a custom ""More honour'd in the breach than the observance."" The Ghost reappears. Hamlet directly addresses it, calling it ""Hamlet, King, father: Royal Dane,"" demanding it speak and explain its return, which makes ""night hideous."" The Ghost beckons Hamlet to follow it alone. Horatio and Marcellus warn Hamlet not to go, fearing it may lead him to madness or harm. Hamlet dismisses their fears, stating he values his life ""not at a pin's fee"" and his soul is immortal. He breaks free from their attempts to restrain him, threatening violence against anyone who hinders him, and follows the Ghost to a more remote part of the platform.

**Scene V: A More Remote Part of the Platform. Night.**
The Ghost leads Hamlet to a secluded area and bids him ""Mark me."" It identifies itself as Hamlet's father's spirit, currently ""Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night, And for the day confin'd to fast in fires,"" until its earthly sins are purged. It commands Hamlet to seek revenge for its ""foul and most unnatural murder."" The Ghost reveals the official story—that a serpent stung him while he slept in his orchard—is a lie. The true ""serpent that did sting thy father's life Now wears his crown,"" revealing Claudius, Hamlet's uncle, as the murderer.

The Ghost denounces Claudius as an ""incestuous, that adulterate beast,"" who seduced Queen Gertrude with ""witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts,"" despite King Hamlet's noble love. The Ghost then describes the murder: while he slept, as was his custom in the afternoon, Claudius stole upon him and poured ""juice of cursed hebenon"" into his ear. This potent poison swiftly coursed through his body, depriving him ""Of life, of crown, of queen, at once."" He died without receiving his last rites (""Unhousel'd, disappointed, unanel'd""), sent to his final account with all his ""imperfections on my head.""

The Ghost urges Hamlet to act, but warns him not to ""Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive Against thy mother aught: leave her to Heaven,"" and to the prickings of her own conscience. As dawn approaches, the Ghost fades, commanding Hamlet to ""remember me."" Hamlet, horrified, vows to erase all other thoughts and dedicate his memory solely to his father's command.

Horatio and Marcellus arrive, anxious for news. Hamlet's replies are disjointed and ""wild and whirling words."" He hints at a villain in Denmark but avoids explicit details. He makes them swear on his sword not to reveal what they have seen. The Ghost's voice from beneath the stage twice commands them to ""Swear."" Hamlet acknowledges the strangeness of the event, stating there are ""more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, Than are dreamt of in your philosophy."" He then warns them that he may ""put an antick disposition on"" (feign madness) and makes them swear not to give any hint that they know his behavior is feigned. Hamlet concludes with a lament: ""The time is out of joint;--O cursèd spite, That ever I was born to set it right!""

**ACT II**

**Scene I: A Room in Polonius's House.**
Ophelia, deeply distressed, reports to Polonius an alarming encounter with Hamlet. She describes him entering her closet dishevelled, pale, with knocking knees and a ""piteous"" look. He gripped her wrist, held her at arm's length, and stared intently at her face ""As he would draw it."" After a long silence, he shook her arm slightly, waved his head thrice, and then sighed so profoundly it seemed ""to shatter all his bulk."" He then released her, backing out of the room with his eyes fixed on her until he was out of sight. Polonius, convinced, concludes Hamlet is ""Mad for thy love."" Ophelia confirms she has obeyed her father's command to repel Hamlet's letters and deny his access, which Polonius now believes is the cause of Hamlet's madness. Polonius decides to immediately inform the King.

**Scene II: A Room in the Castle.**
King Claudius and Queen Gertrude welcome Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, Hamlet's old friends. The King expresses concern over Hamlet's ""transformation"" and asks them to remain at court to observe him, cheer him, and discover the unknown cause of his affliction. They pledge their full obedience.

Polonius enters, confidently stating he has discovered ""The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy."" After a verbose preamble, he declares Hamlet ""mad"" and explains his theory. He produces a love letter from Hamlet to Ophelia, which he reads aloud, containing fervent declarations of love despite Hamlet's claim of being ""ill at these numbers."" Polonius reveals that he observed Hamlet's ""hot love"" and, without being prompted by Ophelia, instructed her to reject Hamlet's advances. He attributes Hamlet's subsequent decline—from sadness to weakness, then ""lightness,"" and finally ""madness""—to this rejected love. The King and Queen find this explanation plausible.

Polonius proposes a test: he will ""loose my daughter to him"" while he and the King hide to observe their interaction, hoping to confirm if Hamlet's madness is indeed rooted in love. The King agrees. As Hamlet approaches, reading, the King and Queen withdraw. Polonius confronts Hamlet. Hamlet, exhibiting erratic behavior, calls Polonius a ""fishmonger"" and warns him to prevent his daughter from ""walk[ing] i'the sun,"" hinting at ""conception"" and a ""breeder of sinners."" Polonius, aside, notes, ""Though this be madness, yet there's method in it."" Hamlet continues with satirical remarks about old men and dismisses Polonius.

Rosencrantz and Guildenstern enter. Hamlet greets them warmly but quickly discerns they were ""sent for"" by the King and Queen. He then confides his recent melancholy: he has lost all joy, seeing the world as a ""steril promontory"" and the heavens as a ""foul and pestilent congregation of vapours."" He marvels at ""What a piece of work is man!"" but declares that ""man delights not me,--nor woman neither."" Rosencrantz mentions that a company of players (tragedians of the city) is on their way, explaining their own amusement that Hamlet, delighting not in man, would give them ""lenten entertainment"" (meager welcome). Hamlet questions why these players travel, noting their decline in popular estimation since his uncle became king.

Trumpets announce the players' arrival. Polonius re-enters, excitedly announcing their presence. Hamlet continues to mock Polonius, using allusions to the biblical figure Jephthah and his daughter, which Polonius again notes as ""Still harping on my daughter."" The Players enter, and Hamlet greets them, commenting on the First Player's grown beard and a young actor's height. He asks for a passionate speech, specifically ""Æneas' tale to Dido"" and Priam's slaughter. The First Player delivers an emotional rendition, which moves Hamlet and even Polonius. Hamlet praises the player's performance and instructs Polonius to treat the players well, reminding him that they are the ""abstract and brief chronicles of the time.""

After Polonius exits with most of the players, Hamlet asks the First Player if they can perform ""The murder of Gonzago"" the following night, and if the player could learn a ""dozen or sixteen lines"" he would insert. The player agrees. Alone, Hamlet delivers a soliloquy, chastising himself as a ""rogue and peasant slave"" for his inaction and lack of emotional display compared to the player, who wept for a fictional Hecuba. He calls himself ""dull and muddy-mettled,"" a ""coward,"" and a ""kindless villain,"" for not having avenged his murdered father. He then devises a plan: he will have the players perform a scene similar to his father's murder before the King. He will ""observe his looks"" closely, believing that if the King shows guilt (""blench""), then the Ghost was honest. He acknowledges the Ghost could be the Devil abusing his melancholy. He concludes, ""The play's the thing Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king.""

**ACT III**

**Scene I: A Room in the Castle.**
The King and Queen inquire of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern about Hamlet's condition. They report that Hamlet confesses to distraction but refuses to reveal its cause, maintaining a ""crafty madness."" They mention Hamlet's enthusiasm for the players and the arranged performance that night. Polonius confirms Hamlet's invitation for the King and Queen to attend. The King, pleased, encourages Hamlet's friends to further engage him with these diversions.

The King then dismisses Gertrude, revealing his plan: Hamlet has been privately summoned to ""Affront Ophelia"" as if by accident. Polonius and the King will hide as ""lawful espials"" to observe their interaction and determine if Hamlet's ""affliction"" is truly due to rejected love. Gertrude expresses hope that Ophelia's beauty will restore Hamlet to his ""wonted way."" She exits. Polonius instructs Ophelia to walk and read a book, using the appearance of piety to ""colour Your loneliness."" The King, aside, feels a pang of conscience, realizing Polonius's remark about sugar-coating evil applies to himself. Polonius hears Hamlet approaching, and he and the King conceal themselves.

Hamlet enters and delivers his famous ""To be, or not to be"" soliloquy. He contemplates suicide as a release from life's suffering, weighing the ""slings and arrows of outrageous fortune"" against taking action to end them. He considers death as sleep, but fears ""what dreams may come"" in the ""sleep of death,"" which ""Must give us pause."" This fear, he concludes, is ""the respect That makes calamity of so long life,"" causing individuals to endure oppression and injustice rather than ending their lives. He concludes that ""conscience does make cowards of us all,"" leading great enterprises to falter and ""lose the name of action.""

Ophelia returns. Hamlet, seeing her, asks her to remember his sins in her prayers. Ophelia attempts to return ""remembrances"" (gifts and tokens) he once gave her. Hamlet denies ever having given them, stating that ""Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind."" He then questions her honesty and beauty, arguing that beauty corrupts honesty more easily than honesty can elevate beauty. He claims he once loved her, then immediately retracts it: ""I loved you not."" He fiercely commands her, ""Get thee to a nunnery,"" lamenting that he himself is a ""breeder of sinners"" and all men are ""arrant knaves."" He asks where her father is, and upon learning he is ""At home,"" declares, ""Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the fool nowhere but in's own house."" Hamlet continues his rant, accusing women of using ""paintings"" and affected mannerisms (""jig, you amble, and you lisp"") to disguise their ""wantonness."" He declares, ""I'll no more of't; it hath made me mad."" He concludes by stating there will be ""no more marriages: those that are married already, all but one, shall live; the rest shall keep as they are. To a nunnery, go."" Hamlet exits.

Ophelia is left heartbroken, mourning the ""noble mind...o'erthrown,"" seeing the ""rose of the fair state"" and ""glass of fashion"" now ""Like sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh."" The King and Polonius re-emerge. The King is unconvinced Hamlet's behavior stems from love, noting his words ""was not like madness"" but rather suggested ""something in his soul, O'er which his melancholy sits on brood."" He decides to send Hamlet ""with speed to England"" for ""neglected tribute,"" hoping a change of scenery will cure him. Polonius, still clinging to his theory of rejected love, agrees to the England plan but proposes one more attempt: after the play, the Queen should ""be round with him"" (speak plainly) alone, while Polonius hides and listens again. If this fails to reveal the truth, then Hamlet should be sent to England or confined. The King agrees, stating, ""Madness in great ones must not unwatch'd go.""

**Scene II: A Room in the Same.**
Hamlet instructs a Player on the art of acting: speak ""trippingly on the tongue,"" avoid overacting or ""saw[ing] the air"" with hands, and always use ""temperance"" even in intense passion. He criticizes actors who ""tear a passion to tatters,"" split the ""ears of the groundlings,"" and ""out-herod Herod."" He stresses that acting's purpose is ""to hold...the mirror up to nature."" He also admonishes clowns for improvising and making ""barren spectators"" laugh during serious parts of a play. The Player assures Hamlet they have reformed their ways ""indifferently,"" but Hamlet insists on reforming ""altogether."" The Player exits.

Hamlet calls for Horatio and praises him as a just and composed man, immune to fortune's whims, whose ""blood and judgment are so well co-mingled, That they are not a pipe for fortune's finger To sound what stop she please."" Hamlet then reveals that the play about to be performed contains a scene resembling his father's murder. He instructs Horatio to keenly observe the King's reaction during this scene. If the King's ""occulted guilt Do not itself unkennel,"" then the Ghost was a ""damned ghost."" They agree to combine their observations.

A march announces the arrival of the court. The King, Queen, Polonius, Ophelia, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, and other attendants enter. The King asks Hamlet how he fares, to which Hamlet replies with nonsensical wordplay about eating air. Hamlet then asks Polonius if he ever acted in the university, and Polonius proudly recounts playing Julius Caesar and being killed by Brutus. Hamlet makes a jest about it. Hamlet declines to sit with his mother, choosing instead to lie at Ophelia's feet, making suggestive and bitter comments about his mother's quick remarriage and his father's swift forgetting. Ophelia asks about the play's meaning, and Hamlet calls it ""Miching mallecho"" (mischief).

The play-within-a-play begins with a Prologue. Then, a Player King and Queen enter. The Player King expresses his impending death and the Player Queen vows eternal fidelity, declaring, ""None wed the second but who kill'd the first."" Hamlet, aside to Horatio, comments, ""That's wormwood."" The Player King, in the play, acknowledges the Queen's present resolve but suggests it may change. The Player Queen vehemently swears curses upon herself if she remarries. The Player King then rests and sleeps. The Player Queen exits. Queen Gertrude comments, ""The lady doth protest too much, methinks."" Hamlet assures her the Player Queen will keep her word. The King asks if the play contains ""no offence,"" to which Hamlet replies, ""no offence i'the world...poison in jest."" He names the play ""The mouse-trap"" and states it's the ""image of a murder done in Vienna,"" where Duke Gonzago is poisoned for his estate.

Lucianus, nephew to the King in the play, enters. Hamlet explains Lucianus's role as the murderer. Lucianus pours a ""leperous distilment"" into the sleeping Player King's ear. At this precise moment, King Claudius cries out, ""Give me some light: away!"" and rushes out, followed by the entire court, leaving only Hamlet and Horatio. Hamlet is ecstatic, declaring, ""O, good Horatio, I'll take the ghost's word for a thousand pounds. Didst perceive?"" Horatio confirms he ""did very well note him"" during the poisoning.

Rosencrantz and Guildenstern return, reporting the King is ""marvellous distempered"" and the Queen is in ""great affliction,"" desiring to speak with Hamlet in her closet. Hamlet agrees. He then berates his friends for trying to ""play upon me"" like a pipe, to ""pluck out the heart of my mystery,"" asserting, ""Call me what instrument you will, though you can fret me, you cannot play upon me."" Polonius enters, again summoning Hamlet to his mother. Hamlet further mocks Polonius by asking him to describe a cloud, which Polonius quickly changes from a camel to a weasel to a whale, agreeing with Hamlet's every suggestion. Hamlet notes, ""They fool me to the top of my bent."" He agrees to come to his mother ""by and by."" Alone, Hamlet feels the ""witching time of night,"" capable of ""bitter business."" He reaffirms his resolve to ""speak daggers"" to his mother but to use ""none,"" remembering the Ghost's command.

**Scene III: A Room in the Same.**
King Claudius, alone with Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, states he finds Hamlet's madness dangerous and plans to send him ""to England"" with them immediately, with ""commission"" for Hamlet's ""speedy voyage,"" to contain ""this fear."" Rosencrantz and Guildenstern readily agree. Polonius enters, confirming Hamlet is going to his mother's closet and reiterating his plan to hide ""Behind the arras"" to overhear their conversation, believing the Queen will ""tax him home"" (reprimand him severely). He exits to hide. The King exits.

**Scene III: The Queen's Chamber.**
Queen Gertrude and Polonius are in her chamber. Polonius advises the Queen to be direct with Hamlet about his ""pranks."" He then hides behind the arras. Hamlet enters. A heated exchange ensues between Hamlet and his mother. Hamlet accuses her of offending his true father, while she accuses him of offending his ""father"" (Claudius). When she asks if he has forgotten her, Hamlet asserts she is the queen, his ""husband's brother's wife,"" and his mother. When she threatens to send others to speak to him, Hamlet forcefully makes her sit, declaring he will ""set you up a glass Where you may see the inmost part of you."" The Queen, alarmed, cries ""Help, help, ho!"" Polonius, from behind the arras, echoes ""What, ho! help!"" Hamlet, thinking it's the King, cries ""How now! a rat?"" and impulsively stabs through the arras, killing Polonius.

The Queen is horrified. Hamlet, returning, asks, ""Is it the king?"" He then confronts her about her ""rash and bloody deed,"" calling it ""almost as bad...As kill a king, and marry with his brother."" The Queen, shocked, asks, ""As kill a king!"" Hamlet confirms, ""Ay, lady, 'twas my word."" Hamlet then addresses Polonius's dead body, calling him a ""wretched, rash, intruding fool,"" admitting he ""took thee for thy better."" He turns back to his mother, condemning her marriage as an act that ""blurs the grace and blush of modesty"" and makes ""marriage vows As false as dicer's oaths."" He shows her two pictures, one of his noble father (""Hypérion's curls; the front of Jove himself"") and one of Claudius, whom he describes as a ""mildew'd ear, Blasting his wholesome brother."" He questions how she could descend from such a man to ""batten on this moor.""

The Queen is deeply affected, confessing, ""O, Hamlet! thou hast cleft my heart in twain."" Hamlet continues his indictment, calling Claudius a ""murderer and a villain,"" a ""cutpurse of the empire,"" and ""A king Of shreds and patches."" The Ghost of King Hamlet reappears, visible only to Hamlet. Hamlet questions its purpose, acknowledging he has been ""laps'd in time and passion"" regarding his command. The Ghost states it comes ""but to whet thy almost blunted purpose"" and urges Hamlet to comfort his mother. The Queen, unable to see the Ghost, believes Hamlet is mad, speaking to ""vacancy."" Hamlet tries to describe the Ghost to her, but she sees nothing. The Ghost exits. Hamlet confirms it was his father ""in his habit as he lived!"" The Queen insists Hamlet's vision is a ""bodiless creation ecstasy"" (madness). Hamlet refutes this, demonstrating his sanity by rationally repeating his accusations. He urges her to ""Confess yourself to heaven; Repent what's past; avoid what is to come."" He advises her to ""throw away the worser part"" of her heart and ""live the purer."" He warns her, ""go not to my uncle's bed; Assume a virtue, if you have it not."" Hamlet expresses repentance for killing Polonius and promises to ""answer well The death I gave him."" The Queen exits. Hamlet exits, taking Polonius's body, stating, ""I must be cruel, only to be kind: Thus bad begins, and worse remains behind.""

**ACT IV**

**Scene I: A Room in the Castle.**
King Claudius demands from the Queen what has happened with Hamlet. The Queen, in a state of agitation, reports that Hamlet is ""Mad as the sea and wind,"" and in a ""lawless fit,"" killed Polonius, mistaking him for a rat behind the arras. The King expresses regret, realizing he himself could have been the victim, and worries about the public reaction to this ""heavy deed,"" which they must ""countenance and excuse."" He immediately summons Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, ordering them to find Hamlet, speak to him ""fair,"" and bring Polonius's body to the chapel. The King tells Gertrude he will gather their wisest friends to discuss how to manage the situation. He laments that they cannot punish Hamlet severely due to the ""distracted multitude"" who love him and judge by appearance rather than the actual offense. Rosencrantz returns, unable to get Hamlet to reveal the body's location. The King orders Hamlet brought before him.

Hamlet, accompanied by Guildenstern and Attendants, enters. The King asks where Polonius is. Hamlet replies mockingly that Polonius is ""At supper,"" being eaten by ""politick worms."" He tells the King to send a messenger to heaven to find him, or to seek him in ""the other place"" himself, adding that within a month he will be found by smell. The King orders Guildenstern to search. The King then informs Hamlet that, for his ""especial safety,"" he must immediately embark ""For England."" Hamlet agrees, bidding farewell to his ""dear mother"" (referring to the King, stating ""Father and mother is man and wife; man and wife is one flesh; and so, my mother""). Hamlet exits for England. The King commands Rosencrantz and attendants to ensure Hamlet is swiftly put aboard the ship. Alone, King Claudius reveals his true purpose: he has sent secret ""letters conjuring to that effect"" to England, demanding ""The present death of Hamlet."" He hopes this act will bring him peace.

**Scene II: A Room in the Castle.**
Queen Gertrude is reluctant to speak with Ophelia, who is ""importunate; indeed, distract."" Horatio advises it would be prudent to speak with her to prevent her from spreading ""dangerous conjectures."" Ophelia enters, singing disjointed, sorrowful songs about a lost love, death, and a white shroud, revealing her madness. The King enters and observes her. Ophelia sings about Saint Valentine's Day and a maid who ""Never departed more."" She distributes symbolic flowers: rosemary for remembrance and pansies for thoughts (to Laertes, who enters), fennel for flattery and columbines (to the King), and rue for sorrow, both for herself and, ""with a difference,"" for the Queen (suggesting repentance). She mentions violets withered when her father died. Ophelia exits, still singing and wishing ""Heaven 'a mercy on his soul!""

Laertes, devastated by his sister's madness, exclaims, ""O rose of May!"" and wishes her sanity could inspire revenge. The King notes that ""One woe doth tread upon another's heel,"" referring to Polonius's death and Ophelia's madness. Marcellus enters, warning the King that ""The young Laertes, in a riotous head,"" has returned from France, leading a rebellion and inciting the rabble to cry, ""Laertes shall be king!"" Laertes, armed and followed by Danes, bursts in, demanding his father from the King. The Queen attempts to calm him, but Laertes fiercely declares his fury, stating that any calm blood in him would brand him a bastard. The King, trusting in his divine protection, allows Laertes to approach. Laertes demands to know where his father is. The King states he is ""Dead,"" and the Queen quickly adds, ""But not by him."" Laertes, rejecting allegiance, vows to be ""reveng'd Most throughly for my father."" The King promises to prove his innocence and grief, and to ensure that ""where the offence is let the great axe fall.""

Bernardo enters with letters from Hamlet, one for the King and one for the Queen. The King reads Hamlet's letter, which announces his unexpected return, stating he is ""set naked on your kingdom"" and will beg leave to see the King tomorrow to explain his ""sudden and more strange return."" A postscript specifies ""alone."" The King and Laertes are bewildered. Laertes, however, is invigorated by the news, eager to confront Hamlet. The King, seeing an opportunity, asks Laertes if he will be ""rul'd by me,"" not to peace. Laertes agrees, provided it does not lead to peace. The King then recalls a Norman gentleman who highly praised Laertes' fencing skill, especially with a rapier. He claims Hamlet was envious and wished for Laertes' return to fence with him. The King proposes a plot: they will arrange a fencing match, where Hamlet, being ""remiss, Most generous, and free from all contriving,"" will not inspect the foils. This will allow Laertes to choose an ""unbated"" (unblunted) and sharpened sword, and ""in a pass of practice, Requite him for your father."" Laertes enthusiastically agrees, adding that he has a potent poison, an ""unction of a mountebank,"" to anoint his sword point, ensuring death even from a mere scratch. The King further devises that if Laertes fails, he will prepare a poisoned ""chalice"" for Hamlet to drink during the match.

The Queen enters, bringing another sorrowful report: Ophelia has drowned. She describes Ophelia weaving ""fantastick garlands"" by a brook, climbing a willow tree, and how a branch broke, sending her into the ""weeping brook."" Ophelia, singing ""snatches of old tunes,"" seemed oblivious to her danger until her clothes, heavy with water, pulled her ""to muddy death."" Laertes is overcome with grief but forces back his tears, stating he has ""a speech of fire, that fain would blaze, But that this folly drowns it."" He exits, followed by the King and Queen.

**ACT V**

**Scene I: A Church Yard.**
Two Clowns (gravediggers) are digging a grave. They debate whether Ophelia, having ""wilfully seeks her own salvation"" (committed suicide), deserves a Christian burial. The First Clown, through convoluted and comically misapplied legal arguments, asserts that the ""crowner"" (coroner) has ruled it a Christian burial. The Second Clown reveals that only her status as a ""gentlewoman"" allowed this, as otherwise she would have been buried in unsanctified ground. The First Clown laments that ""great folks should have countenance"" to take their own lives more easily than common people. They then engage in a riddle about who builds stronger than a mason, shipwright, or carpenter. After the Second Clown guesses ""the gallows-maker,"" the First Clown reveals the answer: a ""grave-maker,"" whose ""houses...last till doomsday."" The Second Clown is sent to fetch liquor.

Hamlet and Horatio enter and observe the First Clown singing while he digs and throws up skulls. Hamlet reflects on the skulls, imagining one to be a politician's, another a lawyer's, musing on the ultimate equality of death. He engages the gravedigger in conversation, asking whose grave it is. The Clown, with more wordplay, claims it's his. Hamlet asks how long he has been a gravedigger. The Clown replies that he started on the day King Hamlet defeated Fortinbras, which was also ""the very day that young Hamlet was born,"" and that he has been a sexton for thirty years. This reveals Hamlet's age to be thirty. The Clown then produces a specific skull, identifying it as Yorick's, the king's jester, who has been dead twenty-three years. Hamlet takes the skull, recalling Yorick as a ""fellow of infinite jest"" who carried him on his back as a child. He laments the horrifying transformation of Yorick's once vibrant face and reflects on the transience of life, stating that ""Imperial Cæsar, dead and turn'd to clay, Might stop a hole to keep the wind away.""

Hamlet and Horatio conceal themselves as a funeral procession approaches with ""maimèd rites."" Laertes, the King, Queen, and mourners follow the corpse of Ophelia. Laertes questions the Priest about the abbreviated ceremony. The Priest explains that because her death was ""doubtful"" (suspected suicide), she would have been denied Christian burial entirely were it not for ""great command"" (the King's intervention). He states they cannot sing a ""requiem"" for her. Laertes, enraged, curses the ""churlish priest,"" proclaims that violets will spring from Ophelia's ""unpolluted flesh,"" and declares she will be a ""ministering angel"" while the priest howls in hell. Hamlet, realizing it is Ophelia's funeral, is overcome. The Queen scatters flowers on the grave, expressing her wish that Ophelia had been Hamlet's wife and that she had decked her bridal bed, not her grave. Laertes, in a fit of passionate grief, leaps into the grave, demanding to be buried with his sister.

Hamlet emerges from hiding, questioning whose exaggerated grief this is, and declares, ""this is I, Hamlet the Dane."" Laertes leaps from the grave and grapples with Hamlet, cursing him. Hamlet, asserting his own dangerous nature despite not being ""splenetive and rash,"" demands Laertes release him. The King and Queen command them to be separated. Hamlet fiercely declares his love for Ophelia, stating, ""forty thousand brothers Could not...Make up my sum."" He challenges Laertes to prove his grief through weeping, fighting, fasting, or tearing himself. The Queen attributes Hamlet's outburst to madness. Hamlet exits, saying, ""Let Hercules himself do what he may, The cat will mew, and dog will have his day."" The King sends Horatio to follow Hamlet and reminds Laertes of their plot to avenge his father. He states, ""This grave shall have a living monument,"" likely referring to Hamlet's impending death.

**Scene II: Hall in the Castle.**
Hamlet tells Horatio he regrets his outburst towards Laertes, recognizing that Laertes' grief for his father mirrors his own. Osric, an effeminate courtier, enters and delivers a message from the King: the King has wagered on a fencing match between Hamlet and Laertes. Osric, in an affected manner, praises Laertes as an ""absolute gentleman,"" ""the card or calendar of gentry."" He details the wager: six Barbary horses from the King against six French rapiers and poignards from Laertes for a dozen passes, with the King wagering Laertes will not exceed Hamlet by three hits. Hamlet agrees to the match, joking about the affected language, and states he will attempt to win for the King. Osric exits to convey Hamlet's acceptance. Horatio expresses a foreboding feeling that Hamlet will lose. Hamlet admits to a ""gain-giving"" (misgiving) in his heart but dismisses it as ""foolery,"" stating, ""Not a whit, we defy augury: there is a special providence in the fall of a sparrow."" He accepts his fate.

**Scene III: Room in the Castle.**
The King, Queen, Laertes, Osric, Lords, Ladies, and attendants gather for the fencing match. Hamlet enters with Horatio. Hamlet sincerely apologizes to Laertes for his recent behavior, attributing it to his ""madness"" and likening it to shooting ""my arrow o'er the house, And hurt my brother."" Laertes accepts the apology on a personal level but states his honor prevents him from fully reconciling until a more formal judgment is rendered. They proceed with the match. Hamlet jokes about being Laertes' ""foil"" to highlight Laertes' skill. The King confirms the wager. He orders wine brought and declares that if Hamlet scores the first or second hit, or answers the third, cannons will fire, and he will drink to Hamlet's health, dropping a valuable ""union"" (pearl) into the cup.

The match begins. Hamlet scores the first hit. Osric confirms it. The King orders the cup brought to Hamlet, but Hamlet defers drinking until after the next bout. Hamlet scores a second hit. Laertes admits, ""A touch, a touch, I do confess."" The Queen, against the King's subtle warning, takes the poisoned cup and drinks to Hamlet's fortune. The King, aside, realizes, ""It is the poison'd cup; it is too late."" Laertes, aside, states he will hit Hamlet now, despite it being ""almost against my conscience."" Hamlet urges Laertes to stop ""dallying"" and use his ""best violence."" They play the third pass. Laertes wounds Hamlet with the poisoned rapier. In the ensuing scuffle, they exchange rapiers, and Hamlet wounds Laertes with the same poisoned blade.

The Queen falls back, crying, ""The drink, the drink!--O, my dear Hamlet,--The drink, the drink! I am poison'd."" She is carried off, dying. Hamlet, realizing treachery, orders the doors locked and demands the ""villainy"" be found. Laertes falls, confessing the entire plot: Hamlet is ""slain,"" no medicine can save him as he has less than half an hour to live, and the ""treacherous instrument"" (the poisoned, unbated rapier) is now in Hamlet's hand. He reveals that ""the foul practice Hath turn'd itself on me,"" and further states, ""Thy mother's poison'd: I can no more: the king, the king's to blame."" Hamlet, upon hearing this, cries, ""Then, venom, to thy work,"" and stabs the King, calling him ""incestuous, murd'rous, damnèd Dane,"" and commands him to ""Follow my mother."" The King is borne away, mortally wounded. Laertes, dying, exchanges forgiveness with Hamlet, absolving him of his and his father's deaths. Laertes dies.

Hamlet, also dying, says, ""Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee."" He then implores Horatio, who is attempting to drink the remaining poison from the cup, to live and ""Absènt thee from felicity awhile, And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain, To tell my story,"" so that his ""wounded name"" may be cleared. Hamlet's last words are, ""The potent poison quite o'er-crows my spirit; The rest is silence."" He dies. The curtain descends slowly."
Jane Eyre-Charlotte Brontë,"The narrative begins with a young orphan named Jane Eyre, living with her aunt, Mrs. Reed, and her cousins, Eliza, John, and Georgiana, at Gateshead Hall. It is a cold, rainy day, and Jane is excluded from the family circle by the fire. Mrs. Reed criticizes Jane's disposition and manners. Jane retreats to a window-seat in the breakfast-room, immersing herself in a book with pictures. Her cousin John Reed soon discovers her, verbally abuses her, and then physically strikes her with the book, causing her head to bleed. In a sudden fit of anger, Jane retaliates, calling John a ""murderer"" and ""slave-driver."" Mrs. Reed, alerted by the other children, orders Jane to be locked in the red-room, a seldom-used chamber where Mr. Reed (Jane's deceased uncle and Mrs. Reed's late husband) died.

Trapped in the red-room, Jane reflects on the constant abuse she endures, contrasting it with the indulgence her cousins receive. She recalls that her uncle, Mr. Reed, had made his wife promise to raise Jane as one of her own children. Overwhelmed by fear and a perceived ghostly presence (her own reflection, but also a mysterious light and sound), Jane screams, drawing the attention of Bessie (the nurse) and Miss Abbot (the maid). Mrs. Reed arrives, chastises them, and insists Jane remain locked up longer. Jane pleads for mercy, but Mrs. Reed, viewing her as a manipulative child, locks her back in, causing Jane to lose consciousness.

Jane wakes in her own bed, attended by Bessie and Mr. Lloyd, an apothecary. Mr. Lloyd assesses her condition and promises to return. Jane overhears Bessie and the housemaid, Sarah, discussing Jane's ""fit"" and the ""Missis"" being ""too hard."" Jane later learns from Bessie that her parents died of typhus and her mother was disinherited for marrying a poor clergyman. Mr. Lloyd suggests Jane needs a change of scene and asks if she would like to go to school. Jane, feeling miserable and isolated, eagerly agrees. Mrs. Reed, eager to be rid of Jane, accepts the recommendation.

Jane prepares to leave Gateshead for Lowood School. She refuses to bid Mrs. Reed farewell, stating her aunt has been a ""foe."" On January 19th, she departs by coach for the distant town of Millcote. During the journey, she is apprehensive. She is eventually met by a servant and taken to Lowood, a large, austere institution for orphans. There, she meets Miss Temple, the kind and intelligent superintendent, and Miss Miller, an under-teacher.

Life at Lowood is harsh. The girls endure bitter cold, frozen washing water, and meager, often burnt, porridge for meals. Jane struggles with the strict rules and difficult lessons. She befriends Helen Burns, a patient and deeply spiritual girl who is constantly chastised and physically punished by Miss Scatcherd for minor faults. Jane is enraged by this injustice, but Helen preaches endurance, forgiveness, and faith in God. Jane tells Miss Temple her history, and Miss Temple, believing her, writes to Mr. Lloyd, who corroborates Jane's account. Miss Temple publicly clears Jane's name, bringing Jane relief and acceptance among her peers. Jane excels in her studies, learning French and drawing.

A typhus epidemic sweeps through Lowood, killing many girls. During this time, rules relax, and the remaining healthy girls, including Jane, enjoy more freedom and better food. Helen Burns falls ill with consumption. Jane, unaware of the severity of consumption, continues her studies and enjoys the spring. She learns from a nurse that Helen is dying. Jane secretly visits Helen at night, and they share a tender conversation about faith and the afterlife. Helen dies peacefully in Jane's arms.

Eight years pass. Lowood undergoes reforms after a public inquiry exposes its deplorable conditions. Jane spends six years as a pupil and two as a teacher. Miss Temple marries and leaves, prompting Jane to desire a new life. She advertises for a governess position and receives a reply from a Mrs. Fairfax at Thornfield Hall. Before leaving Lowood, Bessie visits Jane, informing her of Mrs. Reed's terminal illness and the self-destructive lives of John, Eliza, and Georgiana Reed. Bessie also mentions that Jane's uncle, John Eyre, had sought her out years ago, intending to adopt her.

Jane travels to Thornfield Hall, where she is warmly received by Mrs. Fairfax, the kind housekeeper. She learns her pupil, Adèle Varens, is Mr. Rochester's ward. Jane also discovers a strange, recurring, mirthless laugh from the third storey, which Mrs. Fairfax attributes to a servant named Grace Poole. Jane finds Adèle a lively but undisciplined pupil.

One evening, while out posting a letter, Jane encounters a horseman who has fallen on ice. She assists him, and later discovers he is Mr. Rochester, the master of Thornfield. Mr. Rochester is a moody, enigmatic man. He invites Jane and Adèle to tea, where he interrogates Jane, praising her intellect and artistic talent, but also teasing her about her ""plainness."" He confesses to a past of dissolution and a desire for ""fresh pleasure,"" speaking enigmatically of an ""error"" he committed. Jane, falling in love with him, hides her feelings.

A party of fashionable guests arrives at Thornfield, including the beautiful and haughty Blanche Ingram, whom Mrs. Fairfax believes Mr. Rochester intends to marry. Jane observes Mr. Rochester's close attention to Blanche, feeling both pain and a sense of inferiority, but she is not jealous, as she finds Blanche superficial and unkind. During a charade party, Mr. Rochester disguises himself as a gipsy fortune-teller and ""reads"" Jane's fortune, subtly probing her feelings for him and revealing his true intention was to make her jealous. He also tells Blanche Ingram her fortune, hinting at his true financial status, which makes Blanche look ""wondrous grave."" Jane realizes Mr. Rochester was feigning interest in Blanche.

The same night, a stranger named Mr. Mason arrives from the West Indies. Mr. Rochester reacts with extreme agitation upon hearing his name. Later that night, Jane hears a terrifying shriek and struggle from the third floor. Mr. Rochester calms the household, attributing it to a servant's nightmare, but he then secretly enlists Jane's help. He leads her to a hidden room on the third floor, where Mr. Mason lies wounded and bleeding, having been bitten and stabbed by a woman. Mr. Rochester instructs Jane to tend to Mason, forbidding her to speak to him, and then leaves to fetch a surgeon. Jane discovers that Grace Poole is the attendant for this mysterious, violent woman.

The surgeon, Carter, arrives and treats Mason, who murmurs that ""she bit me"" and ""worried me like a tigress."" Mr. Rochester implies that Mason should have been more careful. Mr. Rochester then ensures Mason is quickly and discreetly taken away. Afterward, Mr. Rochester explains to Jane his past: he was forced into a marriage in Jamaica with Bertha Mason, who was already insane and from a mad family. He brought her to Thornfield, confining her to prevent public scandal, and had intended to commit bigamy by marrying Jane. He claims he loves Jane and wants her to be his wife, not his mistress. Jane is horrified by the revelation of his existing marriage and refuses to be his mistress, asserting her principles and independent will. She tells him she must leave him.

On the eve of what was to be their wedding, Jane flees Thornfield Hall. She walks to Whitcross, destitute and starving. After two days of wandering, she collapses on the doorstep of a house called Moor House, where she is found by Mr. St. John Rivers. He and his sisters, Diana and Mary, take her in, nursing her back to health. Jane, using the alias ""Jane Elliott,"" tells them a partial story of her past. She soon discovers that St. John, Diana, and Mary are her cousins; their uncle, John Eyre, had died in Madeira and left his entire fortune of twenty thousand pounds to ""his brother the clergyman’s orphan daughter""—Jane.

Jane insists on dividing the inheritance equally among the four cousins, giving each five thousand pounds. St. John initially resists, but Jane is resolute, desiring genuine family connection over wealth. The matter is settled by arbitration.

Jane takes a position as a schoolmistress in Morton, a village near Moor House, teaching poor girls. St. John, a zealous clergyman, reveals his ambition to become a missionary in India. He falls in love with Rosamond Oliver, a beautiful local heiress, but suppresses his feelings, believing she is not suited to be a missionary's wife. Rosamond eventually marries another. St. John then asks Jane to marry him and accompany him to India as his helpmeet, arguing it is God's will and that she is ""formed for labour, not for love."" Jane almost yields to his powerful influence and sense of duty, but then she hears a voice, ""Jane! Jane! Jane!"" which she recognizes as Mr. Rochester's, speaking in pain. This spiritual summons confirms her decision to seek out Mr. Rochester. She refuses St. John's proposal, but offers to go with him as a fellow-missionary, which he rejects unless she is his wife. Jane resolves to find Mr. Rochester.

Jane returns to Whitcross and learns from the innkeeper that Thornfield Hall burned down. The innkeeper reveals that Bertha Mason, Mr. Rochester's mad wife, set the fire and then committed suicide by jumping from the roof. Mr. Rochester, in his attempt to save her, was severely injured: one eye was knocked out, a hand crushed and amputated, and the other eye inflamed, leaving him blind and crippled. He now lives in seclusion at Ferndean Manor with old John and his wife.

Jane immediately travels to Ferndean. She finds Mr. Rochester blind, mutilated, and desolate. Pilot, his dog, recognizes her, alerting Mr. Rochester to her presence. He recognizes her voice and touch, and is overwhelmed with joy. Jane reveals her new fortune and her desire to stay with him, to be his companion, nurse, and eyes. She teases him about his looks, and he playfully responds. She describes St. John Rivers, making Mr. Rochester jealous, which Jane enjoys as it lifts his melancholy. Mr. Rochester asks her to marry him, a ""poor blind man,"" a ""crippled man."" Jane accepts, confirming her love for him.

Mr. Rochester recounts hearing Jane's voice calling him near midnight, the same time Jane heard his voice. He believes their souls met. He thanks God for tempering judgment with mercy, believing his past sins and afflictions have led him back to Jane.

They have a quiet wedding with only the parson and clerk present. Jane informs her cousins, Diana and Mary, who approve, and St. John, who does not respond directly. Jane retrieves Adèle from her strict school and places her in a more suitable one, eventually making her a pleasing companion.

Ten years later, Jane writes the conclusion. She and Mr. Rochester are supremely happy in their marriage. Mr. Rochester regained sight in one eye two years into their marriage. He can now see dimly and recognized his first-born son, who inherited his own eyes. Diana and Mary Rivers are both happily married. St. John Rivers went to India as a missionary, sacrificing personal happiness for his calling. He remains unmarried, working tirelessly, and Jane expects to hear of his death soon, but knows he anticipates his ""incorruptible crown"" in heaven."
Madame Bovary-Gustave Flaubert,"This detailed summary is based solely on the provided text, ""Madame Bovary.""

**Part I**

**Chapter One**
The story begins with the arrival of a new, awkward country lad named Charles Bovary, about fifteen, in a classroom. He wears an odd, composite cap that causes much amusement among his schoolmates. The headmaster eventually identifies him as Charles Bovary and punishes him. Charles proves to be a conscientious student.

His father, Monsieur Charles Denis Bartolome Bovary, a retired assistant-surgeon-major, had squandered his wife's considerable dowry and, after a failed attempt at farming, settled into an idle life in the country. Charles's mother, a once lively woman, became ill-tempered and managed the household, silently enduring her husband's infidelities. Young Charles was spoiled by his mother but his father, playing the philosopher, attempted to raise him hardily. Despite these conflicting influences, Charles grew up peaceable and strong.

At twelve, Charles began irregular and ineffective lessons with the local curé. At eighteen, he was sent to school in Rouen, where he was an average, even-tempered student. After three years, his parents withdrew him to study medicine. His mother set him up in Rouen, but Charles struggled with the vast curriculum. He gradually became idle, frequented public-houses, developed a passion for dominoes, and engaged in romantic adventures. He failed his first medical examination but, after intense cramming, passed the second.

Charles decided to practice in Tostes, succeeding an old doctor. His mother soon found him a wife: Madame Dubuc (Heloise), a forty-five-year-old widow with an income, whom Charles's mother deftly secured despite her being considered ugly. Charles expected an easier life, but Heloise proved controlling, monitoring his finances, patients, and social interactions, and constantly complaining of various ailments, accusing him of neglecting her.

**Chapter Two**
One night, Charles and Heloise are awakened by a horseman requesting the doctor for a broken leg at the Bertaux farm, eighteen miles away. Heloise, fearing for Charles, insists he wait for the moonrise and have a boy guide him. Charles sets out at 4 AM, half-asleep, and is guided by a boy to the prosperous farm. He meets Monsieur Rouault, a fat, earring-wearing man of fifty, whose leg fracture is simple.

Charles performs the bandaging. Monsieur Rouault’s daughter, Mademoiselle Emma Rouault, a young woman in a blue dress, assists, pricking her fingers while sewing pads. Charles notices her delicate, almond-shaped nails and bold, dark eyes. After the procedure, Charles is invited to dine with Emma, who expresses her dislike for country life and mentions her convent education. Charles is captivated by Emma's appearance and the encounter.

Instead of returning in three days, Charles visits daily, then twice a week. Monsieur Rouault is impressed by Charles's skill. Charles finds pleasure in these visits, observing Emma's small wooden shoes and her movements. Emma accompanies him to the stairs, where he admires her in the open air.

Heloise becomes suspicious of Charles's frequent trips to the Bertaux, especially after learning Emma is educated. She makes accusations, eventually forcing Charles to swear on a prayer-book that he will no longer visit. Charles, despite obeying, feels a naive sense of entitlement to love Emma. He contrasts Heloise's thin, bony appearance with Emma's beauty.

Charles's mother visits, leading to arguments with Heloise over Charles's habits. Soon after, it is discovered that the notary managing Heloise’s property has absconded with money, revealing that Heloise’s supposed fortune was largely fictitious. Charles's father blames Charles's mother for the marriage. Heloise, in tears, pleads with Charles to defend her. A week later, Heloise suffers a hemorrhage and dies suddenly. Charles is surprised and, leaning against a writing-table, reflects on her love for him.

**Chapter Three**
Old Rouault visits Charles, bringing payment for his leg and a turkey, offering condolences and encouraging him to visit the Bertaux. Charles follows the advice, finding the farm lively and Monsieur Rouault recovered. Charles begins to enjoy his newfound independence and the improved perception of him in the community.

During a visit, he finds Emma sewing. She offers him curacao, which she sips seductively. They converse, discussing their pasts. Emma expresses a desire for town life. Charles becomes infatuated and considers marrying her. Monsieur Rouault, struggling financially, mentally agrees to the match, noting Charles's good upbringing and expecting a modest dowry.

At Michaelmas, Charles formally proposes to Monsieur Rouault, who, having already anticipated it, agrees to consult Emma. Emma, by prearranged signal, indicates her acceptance. The marriage is planned for the following spring. Emma spends the winter preparing her trousseau, dreaming of a grand wedding, but her father insists on a conventional one. The wedding takes place with 43 guests, lasting sixteen hours, followed by days of celebration.

**Chapter Four**
The wedding is a large rural affair, with guests arriving from various villages. Descriptions detail their provincial attire and boisterous behavior. The procession to the church is long, with Emma's dress trailing and Charles waiting for her. The banquet features copious food, including an elaborate confectionery display. Guests indulge in eating, drinking, singing, and rough jokes. Charles, not being facetious, does not shine.

The next day, Charles is transformed, openly affectionate with Emma, calling her ""my wife."" Emma, however, shows no sign of emotion. Two days later, they leave for Tostes, with old Rouault accompanying them partway. He sighs watching their cart disappear, reminiscing about his own wedding.

Charles and Emma arrive in Tostes. The old servant suggests Emma inspect the house.

**Chapter Five**
The Tostes house is described as modest, with Charles's consulting room adjacent to the living area. Emma is immediately struck by the sight of Charles's first wife's bridal bouquet in their bedroom. Charles moves it to the attic, while Emma thinks of her own.

Emma immediately begins redecorating, changing wallpaper, repainting the staircase, and planning garden improvements. Charles, deeply happy, finds pleasure in Emma's presence and small gestures. He adores her, believing his life has finally begun. Emma, however, feels that the happiness she expected from love has not materialized. She questions the meaning of ""felicity, passion, rapture"" learned from books.

**Chapter Six**
Emma’s past is revealed: as a child, she read romantic novels like ""Paul and Virginia."" At thirteen, she was sent to a convent, where she found pleasure in religion and romantic literature. She devoured novels filled with tales of love, suffering, and brave gentlemen. She developed a love for historical events, dreaming of chivalry. She preferred the exciting aspects of life, like storms at sea or ruins in fields, to the calm of the countryside.

After her mother's death, Emma engaged in dramatic mourning, secretly pleased with her ""pale lives"" ideal, but eventually grew tired of it. The nuns noticed her slipping from her religious vocation. Returning home, she found country life disgusting, missing the convent. When Charles first came to the Bertaux, she thought herself disillusioned. However, Charles’s presence made her believe she was finally experiencing the wondrous passion she sought, though the calm in her life did not match her dreams of happiness.

**Chapter Seven**
Emma sometimes believes her honeymoon is the happiest time, but dreams of exotic lands and elegant, accomplished husbands, contrasting them with Charles's commonplace conversation and lack of refinement. She resents his easy calm and his belief that she is happy.

Charles, proud of Emma, displays her sketches and admires her piano playing. Emma manages the household efficiently, bringing respect to Charles. Charles works long hours, returning late, and Emma serves him dinner. He is described as having cold feet, unkempt hair, and ill-fitting boots, which Emma finds irritating.

Charles's mother often visits, criticizing Emma's spending and refined ways, and trying to impose her own economical habits. This causes silent tension between the women, and Charles is caught in the middle. Charles's mother feels Emma has usurped her place in his affections.

Emma tries to force herself to love Charles, reciting romantic verses and singing, but feels no change, and Charles remains unmoved. She concludes his passion is ordinary and habitual. She walks her greyhound, Djali, to escape her boredom, reflecting on her marriage and longing for a different life. She feels her life is cold and monotonous.

An unexpected invitation arrives: the Marquis d’Andervilliers, whom Charles had cured, invites the Bovarys to a ball at his château, Vaubyessard. The Marquis, impressed by Emma, saw it as a polite gesture. Charles and Emma prepare for their trip.

**Chapter Eight**
The Bovarys arrive at the grand, Italianate Château Vaubyessard. Emma is awestruck by the opulent marble vestibule, ancestral portraits, and billiard room. At dinner, she is overwhelmed by the luxury, exotic foods, and elegant company. She is particularly fascinated by the old Duke de Laverdiere, a former courtier and lover of Queen Marie Antoinette, who dines messily. Emma experiences iced champagne, pomegranates, and pineapples for the first time.

Emma meticulously prepares for the ball, while Charles is uncomfortable in his tight clothes. Emma discourages Charles from dancing, saying he would look ridiculous and it's unfitting for a doctor.

At the ball, Emma is initially timid but soon feels transformed by the music and dancing. She observes the distinguished guests, noting their refined appearance and conversation. She dances a cotillion with a Viscount, feeling a ""torpor"" and almost fainting in his arms. The experience is intoxicating.

During the ball, Emma glimpses peasant faces pressed against the windows, which makes her recall the Bertaux and her simple past life, which now fades into insignificance. She is consuming a maraschino ice when she sees a young woman slip something into the Viscount's hat.

After the ball, Emma gazes from her window, wanting to prolong the illusion of this luxurious life. The next day, after a brief luncheon, they tour the stables and hot-houses. Charles finds a green silk cigar case with two cigars, which he puts in his pocket.

Returning to Tostes, Emma, in a fit of temper, fires their servant, Nastasie. Charles, fond of Nastasie, is concerned. Emma scornfully dismisses his attempt to smoke the found cigar, snatching the case and hiding it. The next day, Emma feels a profound sense of loss and disillusionment, realizing the ball has created a ""hole"" in her life. The memory of the ball becomes an obsession.

**Chapter Nine**
Emma frequently retrieves the green silk cigar case, imagining it belonged to the Viscount and symbolizing a life of love and luxury in Paris. She buys a map of Paris and devours society journals, projecting her desires onto imaginary characters and an idealized Parisian life, contrasting it with her ""mediocre"" existence in the country.

She hires a young orphan, Félicité, as her new servant, attempting to transform her into a lady's maid. Emma buys fashionable items for her home and herself, which Charles admires. Charles, though, remains a simple, unambitious doctor, admired by country folk but not by Emma. She is irritated by his lack of refinement and his contentment, which she sees as an ""imbecile insult.""

Emma's inner turmoil, desires, rage, and hate consume her. She is in love with Léon, the notary's clerk, and cherishes his image in solitude, though his presence makes her emotions subside. She struggles to express her feelings, wishing Léon would guess them. Her attempts to be virtuous are tinged with pride and self-pity. She despises Charles, blaming him for her misery, and even wishes he would beat her to justify her hatred. She contemplates fleeing with Léon but is afraid.

Emma suffers from physical symptoms attributed to ""nerves,"" which she tells Félicité not to mention to Charles. Félicité shares a story of a woman who was cured by marriage, to which Emma replies that her suffering began *after* marriage.

The curé, Abbe Bournisien, visits Emma, but his mundane advice about tea and sugared water for ""indigestion"" fails to address her spiritual distress. Emma, pushing her daughter, Berthe, away in irritation, causes the child to fall and cut her cheek. Emma is distraught, but Charles quickly reassures her. Later, Emma observes Berthe, thinking, ""how ugly this child is!""

Charles, having gone to the chemist's, is asked by Homais to obtain information about daguerreotypes for a portrait of himself as a surprise for Emma. Léon, who is there, wonders if Charles suspects his feelings for Emma. Léon, weary of his unrequited love and the monotony of Yonville, decides to move to Paris to finish his law studies. He plans his new life with artistic aspirations.

Léon's departure is filled with sentimental goodbyes from Homais and his family. Léon and Emma share a tense, silent farewell, holding hands. Emma asks him to kiss Berthe. As Léon leaves, Emma watches him from her window, then feels a profound emptiness. Homais, at dinner, speculates about Léon's future dissolute life in Paris, while Charles worries about him. Homais also mentions the upcoming agricultural meeting in Yonville.

**Part II (cont.) / Part III (start)**

**Part III**

**Chapter One** (The text provided labels this as Part III, Chapter One. It continues the plot after Léon's departure from Yonville).
The day after Léon's departure, Emma feels enveloped in a ""black atmosphere,"" consumed by melancholy and despair. Léon's memory haunts her. She regrets not seizing happiness with him, yearning for his lips, and curses herself for not loving him. She is consumed by her unfulfilled desires. However, with time and absence, her passion for Léon gradually fades, replaced by a dull ache. She attributes her dislike for Charles to her aspirations for Léon.

Emma returns to her frivolous ways, buying a Gothic prie-dieu, spending on nail polish, ordering a cashmere gown, and wearing a fine scarf from Lheureux while reading. She tries to learn Italian, history, and philosophy, but her efforts are sporadic. She has fits of folly, like drinking a glass of brandy. She becomes pale, speaks of old age, and frequently faints.

Charles, worried, writes to his mother, who suggests Emma needs manual labor and criticizes her ""bad books"" and lack of religion. They decide to stop Emma from reading novels. Charles's mother goes to Rouen to cancel Emma's library subscription.

During this time, Monsieur Rodolphe Boulanger, a wealthy landowner from La Huchette, visits Charles to have his ploughman bled. Rodolphe, a brutal but intelligent man with much experience with women, is immediately attracted to Emma. During the blood-letting, both the ploughman and Justin (Homais's apprentice) faint. Emma ministers to Justin. Rodolphe observes Emma, noticing her beauty, and contrasts her with Charles, whom he finds stupid and unkempt. He decides he will seduce her, seeing her as a ""carp gaping after water on a kitchen-table."" He resolves to find opportunities, planning to visit them and invite them to his estate.

**Chapter Eight** (The numbering in the text is continuous from Part II, Chapter 7 to 8. This refers to the agricultural show.)
The agricultural show in Yonville-l’Abbaye is a grand event. Homais is prominent, dressed up, discussing his role on the consulting commission, and delivering a long, scientific discourse on agriculture. Madame Lefrancois reveals to Homais that Lheureux is ruining Pere Tellier, the cafe owner. Homais, shocked, goes to greet Emma.

Rodolphe, avoiding Homais, takes Emma aside. They walk among the crowds and livestock. Rodolphe mocks the provincial show and the Yonville ladies, contrasting his own negligent but elegant attire. He speaks of his own depression and missed opportunities, hinting at his deep capacity for love. Emma feels a connection. A cannon announces the arrival of Monsieur Lieuvain, the councillor, who delivers a long, bombastic speech praising the government, agriculture, and progress.

Rodolphe, meanwhile, whispers to Emma, criticizing societal conventions and ""duty,"" and asserting that passions are the only beautiful thing. He describes love as a treasure that comes suddenly, for two souls destined to be together. He takes her hand. Emma feels faint, recalling the Viscount from the Vaubyessard ball, and is simultaneously aware of Rodolphe's scent and the distant sight of the ""Hirondelle,"" reminding her of Léon.

Lieuvain continues his speech, praising hard-working farmers and servants. Monsieur Derozerays gives another speech. Rodolphe, pulling Emma closer, talks of dreams, magnetism, and affinities, claiming their meeting was fated. He seizes her hand; she does not withdraw it. As the speeches continue, Rodolphe and Emma gaze at each other, their fingers intertwined.

Catherine Leroux, an old servant with 54 years of service, receives a silver medal and 25 francs, declaring she will give the money to the curé for masses. Homais scoffs at her ""fanaticism.""

After the speeches, Rodolphe walks Emma home, dreaming of their future together. At the evening fireworks, Emma is with Charles and the Homais family. The fireworks are a failure. Emma nestles against Charles, but Rodolphe watches her in the lantern light. They part.

Two days later, Homais publishes a self-congratulatory article in the local newspaper about the show, praising progress and subtly criticizing the clergy.

**Chapter Nine** (The numbering in the text is continuous from Part III, Chapter 8 to 9. This refers to Rodolphe's re-engagement with Emma.)
Six weeks later, Rodolphe reappears, having deliberately delayed his return to heighten Emma's anticipation. Emma, pale, is alone. Rodolphe feigns illness and claims he didn't want to return, then confesses his constant thoughts of her and his irresistible attraction. Emma is moved by his words, her pride swelling. He describes watching her house at night. She sobs, ""Oh, you are good!"" He declares his love, and as Charles enters, Rodolphe covers his tracks by claiming he was discussing Emma's health and suggesting horse riding as a remedy.

Emma initially refuses Rodolphe's offer of a horse, but Charles, eager for her health, insists she accept and buy a riding habit. She agrees. The next day, Rodolphe arrives with two horses. Emma, dressed in her new habit, rides with him. Justin and Homais watch them leave, with Homais offering cautions.

During their ride, Rodolphe removes ferns from her stirrup, brushing her leg. They dismount in the forest. Rodolphe declares his love, expressing it calmly and sadly. Emma, stirring wood with her foot, initially resists, calling it impossible. He seizes her wrist. She looks at him with an ""amorous and humid look,"" then asks to return. He shows anger, then becomes timid and respectful, putting his arm around her. He leads her to a secluded spot by a pool. Emma, murmuring, ""I am wrong! I am wrong! I am mad to listen to you!"" eventually yields, leaning on his shoulder, and gives herself to him.

Returning to Yonville, Emma is transformed. She looks at herself in the mirror, repeating, ""I have a lover! a lover!"" experiencing a ""second puberty."" She feels a ""satisfaction of revenge"" and tastes this love ""without remorse."" They meet regularly, exchanging letters. Emma hides hers in a wall fissure. She makes daring daytime visits to Rodolphe's house when Charles is out, arriving breathless and flushed. Rodolphe, however, eventually finds her visits ""imprudent.""

**Chapter Ten**
Rodolphe's concerns about Emma compromising herself lead her to be more cautious. One morning, returning from Rodolphe's, she encounters Captain Binet duck-hunting illegally. She gives a flimsy excuse about visiting the nurse, fearing Binet will guess her secret. At the chemist's, she sees Binet again, who is buying corrosive chemicals. Emma is consumed by anxiety that Binet will expose her.

They arrange night time rendezvous in the garden or Charles's consulting room. Emma makes excuses to Charles, who is often chatting by the fire. She wishes Rodolphe were more dramatic. He finds her sentimental attachment and requests for a ""wedding-ring"" excessive. Rodolphe's passion wanes, and he becomes indifferent, though Emma redoubles her efforts. Their love becomes ""like a married couple.""

Old Rouault sends another turkey and a letter, mentioning Charles's hard work. Emma reads it, recalling her hopeful youth and lamenting her current unhappiness. She suddenly embraces Berthe, washing and doting on her, then just as quickly gives her back to the servant. Rodolphe, finding Emma serious, misses three rendezvous. Emma repents, then sees an opportunity in Homais's new plan.

**Chapter Eleven**
Homais, eager for progress and celebrity, convinces Charles to operate on Hippolyte, the stable-boy, to correct his club-foot. Emma encourages Charles, seeing it as a way to enhance his reputation and her own status. Charles, urged on by Emma and Homais, studies the procedure. Homais persuades Hippolyte with promises of improved health and attractiveness. Emma, paying for the necessary machine, convinces Charles to undertake the operation.

Charles performs the tenotomy, cutting Hippolyte's Achilles tendon. Homais exaggerates the success in a newspaper article, claiming the operation was ""as if by magic."" Five days later, Hippolyte is in agony, his foot swollen and infected. The machine is removed, revealing gangrene. Charles is distraught. Monsieur Canivet, a renowned doctor from Neufchâtel, is called. He disdainfully amputates Hippolyte's leg, condemning Charles's ""Parisian inventions.""

Charles is consumed by guilt and fear of ruin. Emma watches him, filled with contempt for his mediocrity. She feels her own humiliation and the waste of her life. During Hippolyte's amputation, she is distant from Charles, thinking of Rodolphe and ""triumphant adultery."" Charles asks her to kiss him; she rejects him violently, smashing a barometer. Rodolphe finds Emma waiting for him in the garden, and their rancor melts away.

**Chapter Twelve**
Emma and Rodolphe resume their affair with renewed intensity. Emma visits Rodolphe frequently, complaining about Charles and her life. She expresses a desire to run away with him. Rodolphe, however, is amused by her ""mad"" idea and changes the subject. He does not understand her need for love to have a ""motive"" or ""reason."" Emma's tenderness for Rodolphe grows with her increasing repulsion for Charles. She lavishes attention on her appearance for Rodolphe.

Justin, the chemist's apprentice, witnesses Félicité ironing Emma's delicate clothes and cleaning her muddy boots, which Emma frequently replaces. Emma also buys Hippolyte a luxurious, spring-jointed wooden leg, costing Charles 300 francs. Hippolyte, embarrassed by it, requests a more practical one, which Charles also pays for. Lheureux, the draper, supplies the wooden legs and other goods, often visiting Emma to tempt her with Parisian items and never asking for immediate payment. Emma, indulging her caprices, buys a riding whip for Rodolphe.

Lheureux eventually presents a large bill to Emma. She is financially desperate, having many unpaid debts. Lheureux offers to replace Charles's signed bills with new ones, suggesting Emma take over his father-in-law's estate with a power of attorney. Emma, with the money from the Barneville property (a miserable hovel she inherited), pays some debts. Lheureux then presents her with four new bills for 1000 francs each, discounted by his broker friend Vincart, giving her only 1800 francs instead of 2000.

Emma's spending continues. She renews bills, creating a cycle of debt. Charles's mother, visiting, criticizes Emma's extravagance. Emma, in hysterics, defends herself against Charles's mother, who eventually leaves. Emma manipulates Charles into signing another power of attorney. She and Léon then enjoy extravagant rendezvous in Rouen.

One night, Emma does not return to Yonville. Charles, frantic, searches for her. He eventually finds her in Rouen, where she claims to have been ill at her music teacher's. Emma, now feeling she has Charles's permission, frequently visits Léon in Rouen. Léon's master, Dubocage, complains about his absences. Emma also wishes Léon to dress more elegantly and criticizes his lodgings. She tries to make him write love poems, but he copies one from a ""Keepsake."" Léon becomes more passive, almost her ""mistress.""

Léon, feeling obliged, invites Homais to Rouen for dinner. Homais, adopting a ""gay Parisian style,"" enthusiastically accepts. He and Léon dine, with Homais expounding immoral theories about women and their passions. Léon, desperate to be alone with Emma, makes excuses, but Homais insists on accompanying him. Emma, furious at Léon's lateness, initially rejects him but quickly succumbs to his pleas.

Their love becomes more physical, less sentimental. Léon grows tired of her intensity. Emma, feeling ""all the platitudes of marriage"" in adultery, still clings to him. She continues to write love letters, but imagines an idealized, phantom lover.

Financial troubles escalate. Emma receives a summons for a 700-franc bill. She confronts Lheureux, who reveals her mounting debts and threatens distraint on her furniture. He suggests she sell her Barneville property, which he has already arranged to buy at a low price, but then refuses to give her any money. Lheureux hints at her ""little theft"" (the 1800 francs). Emma collapses. Lheureux pushes her out.

**Chapter Seven**
The next day, Maitre Hareng, the bailiff, arrives to inventory Emma’s house. He meticulously lists all her possessions, even opening a desk containing Rodolphe's letters, much to Emma's horror. Emma sends Félicité to keep Charles away while the man in possession is installed in the attic.

Emma feels immense regret and anguish, seeing her possessions stripped away. Charles remains oblivious, pondering their financial woes. He hears a noise from the attic, but Emma lies. The next day, Emma desperately seeks money from brokers in Rouen, but all refuse. She goes to Léon, who reluctantly lets her into their hotel room.

Emma asks Léon for 8000 francs. He calls her mad, but she explains the imminent distraint. Léon, overwhelmed, promises to ask a rich friend, Morel, for 3000 francs, promising to bring it tomorrow. Emma, however, suspects he is lying. She returns to Yonville, mechanically obeying habit.

On the way, she sees the Viscount, the man from the Vaubyessard ball, in his tilbury, driving by. Emma feels abandoned and overwhelmed. At the Croix-Rouge, she sees Homais. The blind beggar sings. Emma, filled with disgust, throws him her last five-franc piece.

The next morning, Emma is woken by a crowd in the Place. Félicité brings her a yellow paper: a notice for the sale of all her furniture. Félicité suggests Emma go to Monsieur Guillaumin, the notary. Emma, hoping for help, goes there.

At the notary’s house, Emma admires his elegant dining room. Guillaumin, who is secretly in league with Lheureux, knows all about her debts. He eats breakfast while Emma tearfully explains her distress. He flirts with her, then refuses to lend her money, but hints at how much she could have made if he had managed her fortune. He then seizes her, confessing his love. Emma recoils, accusing him of taking advantage of her distress, and flees.

Emma, filled with rage and contempt for men, returns home. Félicité asks if she found help. Emma replies, ""No!"" She considers telling Charles everything, imagining his forgiveness, but the thought of his magnanimity exasperates her. She hears Charles approaching. In despair, she runs to Binet, the tax-collector, in his attic.

Madame Tuvache and Madame Caron spy on Emma from a neighboring window. Binet, engrossed in his lathe, is oblivious. Emma tries to explain her situation, her voice trembling. The women outside speculate she is begging for tax relief or making advances. Emma seizes Binet's hands. He recoils in shock, saying, ""Madame! what do you mean?"" The women are scandalized.

Emma flees Binet's, then goes to Nurse Rollet's house, collapsing on the bed, sobbing. She remembers Léon and Rodolphe, thinking Rodolphe will help her. She rushes to La Huchette, unaware of her ""prostitution.""

**Chapter Eight**
Emma arrives at Rodolphe's château. She enters his room, where he is smoking. She tries to ask for advice but cannot speak. He compliments her, but she replies bitterly, reminding him he disdained her. He offers a vague excuse for their separation. She pretends to believe him. She tells him she has suffered. He replies philosophically, ""Such is life!"" She expresses her enduring love. They hold hands, as they did at the show.

She tells him she is ruined and needs 3000 francs. Rodolphe, turning pale, calmly states he does not have the money, admitting he would have given it if he did, but ""a demand for money being, of all the winds that blow upon love, the coldest and most destructive."" Emma accuses him of never loving her, pointing to his luxurious possessions as proof of his self-indulgence. She throws two of his studs, breaking their chain. She reminds him of his promises, his letter, and how he repulses her for 3000 francs. Rodolphe impassively repeats, ""I haven't got them.""

Emma leaves in a stupor, feeling the walls tremble and the ceiling crush her. She stumbles, her memories exploding in her mind. Madness approaches, but she recovers, vaguely, from the money issue, suffering only in her love. She sees Rodolphe's face everywhere. Her situation becomes an abyss. In a moment of ""heroism,"" she runs to the chemist's shop.

She slips in through the gate, finding Justin in the kitchen. She asks for the key to the ""Capharnaum"" (Homais's laboratory), pretending she needs rat poison. Justin, alarmed by her pallor, gives her the key. She enters the laboratory, goes to the third shelf, seizes a blue jar, extracts white powder (arsenic), and begins to eat it. Justin cries, ""Stop!"" She tells him to be silent, or Homais will be blamed.

Emma returns home, feeling a strange calm. Charles arrives, distracted by the distraint news, cries, and faints. Emma is absent. When she returns, he asks what happened. She writes a letter, seals it, and tells him to read it tomorrow, asking no questions. She lies down.

A bitter taste awakens her. She feels cold creeping through her. She sighs for water, says she is choking. Vomiting begins. Charles notices a white sediment. Emma denies it. Charles gently touches her stomach; she cries out. She groans, her body shaking, growing paler. Her pulse is imperceptible. She curses the poison, cries, ""Ah! my God! It is horrible!""

Charles, on his knees, begs her to say what she ate. She points faintly. He reads her letter: ""Accuse no one."" He cries, ""Poisoned!"" Félicité runs to Homais, who alerts the village. Charles is distraught. Homais writes to other doctors.

Charles tries to read his medical dictionary. Homais confirms it's arsenic. Charles collapses, sobbing. Emma tells him not to cry, that she will no longer trouble him. She says, ""It had to be, my dear!"" She passes her hand over his hair.

Emma asks for Berthe. The child is brought in, asking for presents. At the mention of ""nurse,"" Emma turns her head in disgust. Berthe notices Emma's pallor and heat. Emma tries to kiss her hand; the child struggles. Charles, sobbing, takes Berthe away.

Canivet arrives, prescribes an emetic. Emma vomits blood, her limbs convulse, her body covered in spots. She screams, cursing the poison. Doctor Lariviere, Charles's old master, arrives. He immediately recognizes her hopeless condition, telling Charles, ""There is nothing more to be done.""

Homais, seizing the opportunity to impress Lariviere, invites him to breakfast, and boasts of his medical knowledge. Justin drops a pile of plates. Lariviere criticizes Homais's actions. Lariviere leaves, avoiding other patients.

Bournisien arrives with holy oil. Homais, despite his disdain for priests, remains present. Charles stands by Emma, pale and weeping. Emma seems to find joy and serenity in seeing the violet stole, finding ""lost voluptuousness"" in a mystical vision. The priest performs extreme unction, anointing her eyes, nostrils, mouth, hands, and feet.

Emma's face appears serene. Charles holds onto hope. Emma asks for her looking-glass, looks at herself, and then turns away, falling back on the pillows. Her breathing becomes rapid, her tongue protrudes, her eyes roll and grow pale. Félicité kneels before the crucifix. Homais and Canivet watch. Bournisien prays. Charles clasps Emma's hands.

Suddenly, the blind man's song is heard from the street. Emma raises herself, hair undone, eyes fixed, crying, ""The blind man!"" and laughs an ""atrocious, frantic, despairing laugh."" She falls back in convulsions. She is dead.

**Chapter Nine**
After Emma's death, Charles is in shock, crying ""Farewell!"" Homais and Canivet drag him from the room. Charles, left alone in the sitting-room, is distraught. Homais returns, inventing a story about Emma mistaking arsenic for sugar.

Charles, in his grief, dictates his wishes for Emma's burial: in her wedding dress, with white shoes and a wreath, in three coffins (oak, mahogany, lead), covered with green velvet. Homais objects to the expense. Charles angrily dismisses him. The priest tries to console Charles with religious platitudes, but Charles bursts into blasphemies.

Homais and Bournisien sit up with the body, debating religion and science. Charles repeatedly returns to Emma's room, contemplating her. He tries to revive her with his will.

Charles's mother arrives, also trying to control funeral expenses, but Charles, in his anger, sends her to buy what is necessary. Later, Homais, returning to the house, helps Félicité, Madame Lefrancois, and Charles's mother dress Emma for burial. Black liquid issues from Emma's mouth when her head is lifted for the wreath. Homais, despite claiming to be a philosopher impervious to death, cuts a lock of Emma's hair for Charles. The chemist and curé, after their watch, share a meal, giggling from the relief after sadness.

The undertaker's men arrive. Charles endures the sound of hammering. The next day, Emma's three coffins are placed outside. Old Rouault arrives and faints.

**Chapter Ten**
Old Rouault, having received a vague letter from Homais, rides frantically to Yonville, experiencing hallucinations and anguish. He arrives to find Emma dead. Homais separates Charles and Rouault, urging dignity.

At the church, during the funeral mass, Charles and Rouault sit together. Charles is lost in despair. Hippolyte, in his new wooden leg, kneels in the church. Charles angrily throws money to a chorister collecting donations.

The procession leaves the church. Charles walks erect at the head. The priests and choristers recite prayers. Charles is overcome by the rituals. They reach the cemetery. The coffin is lowered into the grave. Charles, throwing handfuls of earth, cries, ""Adieu!"" and tries to throw himself in. He is led away, feeling a vague satisfaction that it is over.

Old Rouault smokes his pipe, which Homais judges inappropriate. Homais also notes the absence of Binet and Tuvache. He expresses regret for not having prepared a eulogy. Charles, back home, undresses. Rouault's face is stained with dye from wiping his eyes on his new blouse. Rouault weeps for his lost wife, son, and now daughter. He refuses to see Berthe and returns to Bertaux, promising Charles future turkeys.

Charles and his mother talk all evening. She plans to live with him, regaining his affection. Charles, awake at midnight, thinks of Emma. Rodolphe sleeps. Léon sleeps. Justin weeps at Emma's grave, where Lestiboudois finds him, realizing he is the potato thief.

**Chapter Eleven**
Berthe is brought back, but soon forgets her mother, her gaiety breaking Charles's heart. Financial troubles resume, with Lheureux pressing Charles for exorbitant sums. Charles refuses to sell any of Emma's belongings. His mother leaves after a quarrel.

Others take advantage of Charles: Mademoiselle Lempereur demands payment for lessons Emma never took, the lending library claims three years' subscriptions, and Mere Rollet demands postage for Emma's ""business affairs."" Charles pays, but more debts appear.

Félicité wears Emma's old gowns. Charles sometimes mistakes her for Emma. Félicité eventually runs away with Theodore, stealing the remaining wardrobe.

Charles receives news of Léon's marriage. He later finds Rodolphe's letter, confirming Emma's affair, but his ""vague jealousy"" is lost in his immense grief. He believes all men must have adored her, which makes her seem more beautiful to him. He adopts her tastes, wearing patent leather boots and white cravats, and even signing notes like her. Emma ""corrupted him from beyond the grave.""

Charles sells his silver and drawing-room furniture. Only Emma's bedroom remains untouched. He spends evenings there with Berthe, who is poorly cared for by a charwoman. He mends Berthe's toys and dreams of Emma.

No one visits them anymore. Justin is an assistant in Rouen. Homais, fearing damage to his reputation, successfully conspires to have the blind man, whom he failed to cure, confined to an asylum. This success emboldens Homais, who continues to publish articles and seek the Legion of Honour cross, even designing a star in his garden to represent it.

Charles finally opens Emma's secret desk drawer and finds Léon's letters and Rodolphe's portrait. He is distraught, collapsing in sobs. People assume he has resorted to drink. Some curious onlookers see him weeping in the garden. He visits Madame Lefrancois, seeking someone to talk about Emma with, but she is preoccupied with her own business troubles with Lheureux and Hivert.

One day, Charles sells his last horse at the Argueil market and encounters Rodolphe. They are both pale. Rodolphe, after stammering apologies, invites him for a beer. Charles, lost in reverie, sees Emma in Rodolphe's face and wishes he were him. Rodolphe talks about agriculture. Charles becomes enraged, then falls into ""weary lassitude,"" saying, ""I don't blame you."" He adds, ""It is the fault of fatality!"" Rodolphe finds this remark ""comic and a little mean.""

The next day, Charles is found dead in the arbour, his head back, eyes closed, mouth open, holding a long tress of black hair. Canivet performs a post-mortem, finding nothing.

After everything is sold, 12 francs 75 centimes remain, used to send Berthe to her grandmother. The grandmother dies the same year, old Rouault is paralyzed, and an aunt takes charge of Berthe, sending her to work in a cotton-factory.

Since Charles's death, three doctors have failed in Yonville due to Homais's attacks. Homais now has an enormous practice and is respected by authorities. He has just received the cross of the Legion of Honour."
Mrs. Dalloway-Virginia Woolf,"The story begins with Clarissa Dalloway, a high-society woman in London, who decides to buy flowers herself for a party she is hosting that evening. Her maid, Lucy, is busy with other preparations for the event, which include having doors taken off their hinges by Rumpelmayer’s men. As Clarissa walks through London, she is overcome by the beauty of the June morning and her deep affection for the city. She reminisces about her youth at Bourton, particularly a moment involving Peter Walsh, an old friend whom she expects to return from India soon. She reflects on her decision not to marry Peter, preferring the independence she has with her husband, Richard Dalloway, a Member of Parliament. She recalls a painful breakup scene with Peter by a fountain, convinced that marrying him would have destroyed them both.

Clarissa encounters Hugh Whitbread, another old friend who works at court. Hugh informs her that he and his wife, Evelyn, are in London to see doctors due to Evelyn being ""out of sorts,"" and he confirms he will attend Clarissa's party that night. Clarissa feels a mixture of affection and slight inadequacy around Hugh. She continues her walk, pondering her life, her aging, and her complex feelings, particularly her intense dislike for Miss Kilman, her daughter Elizabeth's history tutor. Clarissa sees Miss Kilman as a resentful, religious woman who imposes her superiority.

While Clarissa is at Mulberry’s, the florist, a loud backfire from a motor car startles her and Miss Pym, the florist. The car, with its blinds drawn, is stopped outside the shop, and rumours immediately circulate among the passers-by about the identity of the important person inside, speculated to be the Prince of Wales, the Queen, or the Prime Minister.

Among the crowd is Septimus Warren Smith, a war veteran, who is deeply disturbed by the motor car. He believes the world is on the verge of bursting into flames and that he is being watched and judged. His young Italian wife, Lucrezia (Rezia), tries to calm him, urging him to move on. She is deeply worried about Septimus, who has recently threatened to kill himself and frequently talks to himself or to a dead friend named Evans. Rezia is distraught, having been advised by Dr. Holmes that Septimus is merely ""a little out of sorts.""

As the mysterious car drives off, an aeroplane appears in the sky, writing letters in smoke. The crowd attempts to decipher the words, guessing ""Glaxo"" or ""Kreemo."" Septimus, sitting with Rezia in Regent's Park, believes the plane is sending messages directly to him, filled with ""unimaginable beauty."" He weeps with emotion. Rezia, however, is told by a nursemaid that it's just advertising ""toffee."" Septimus continues to experience delusions, hearing sparrows sing in Greek about ""no crime"" and ""no death,"" and believing he sees Evans. Rezia, desperate, tries to make him focus on ""real things"" as advised by Dr. Holmes. She feels isolated and tormented by Septimus's condition, wishing he were dead. Septimus, meanwhile, writes down his ""revelations"" on envelopes, such as ""Men must not cut down trees. There is a God. No one kills from hatred. Universal love.""

Rezia attempts to take Septimus away, but he is fixated on his visions. He believes Evans is present and that the ""supreme secret"" must be told to the Prime Minister. His terror escalates when a Skye terrier approaches, which he imagines is turning into a man. He attributes these experiences to a ""heat wave"" and his sensitive brain. He feels he is ""dead, and yet am now alive"" and that ""beauty was everywhere."" When Rezia tells him it's time for their appointment with Sir William Bradshaw, Septimus, smiling mysteriously at his imagined dead friend Evans, tells her the time as the clock strikes the quarter to twelve.

Peter Walsh, passing by in Regent's Park, observes Septimus and Rezia, noting the girl's desperation and the young man's queer appearance, without understanding their plight. He reflects on Clarissa, his past love, and his current situation: he is in London to see lawyers about divorcing his wife in India, with whom he is ""in love."" He remembers Clarissa's refusal to marry him and his ongoing sense of being a failure compared to her and Richard. He also thinks of Sally Seton, another old friend, who surprisingly married a rich man and lives near Manchester. Peter criticizes Clarissa's worldliness, but also acknowledges her enduring qualities and her ""atheist's religion of doing good.""

Septimus and Rezia arrive at Sir William Bradshaw's house. Sir William, a distinguished nerve specialist, quickly diagnoses Septimus with a ""complete physical and nervous breakdown."" He dismisses Dr. Holmes's previous diagnosis. Septimus confesses to having ""committed a crime,"" but Rezia denies it. Sir William tells Rezia that Septimus is very ill, has threatened suicide, and must be sent to a country home for extended rest, away from her. Septimus feels trapped by Holmes and Bradshaw, whom he sees as ""human nature,"" a ""repulsive brute"" persecuting him. He attempts to confess his ""message"" about love and no crime, but cannot articulate it. Sir William, who embodies ""Proportion"" and social order, dismisses them, saying he will make arrangements. Rezia feels deserted and betrayed.

Meanwhile, Lady Bruton hosts a luncheon attended by Richard Dalloway and Hugh Whitbread. Lady Bruton expresses her primary interest: a project to promote the emigration of young English people to Canada. Hugh, skilled in official communication, helps her draft a letter to The Times. Richard finds the subject dull but respects Lady Bruton. During lunch, Lady Bruton mentions Peter Walsh's return. Richard is genuinely pleased, and they briefly discuss Peter's past love for Clarissa and his current troubles with a woman.

After lunch, Richard decides to buy flowers for Clarissa to express his love, a feeling he rarely articulates. He walks across London, reflecting on his life and marriage. Big Ben strikes three as he arrives home. Clarissa, who has been mending her green party dress, is both surprised and touched by his arrival and the flowers. She understands his unspoken feelings. They discuss Peter's return, his divorce, and Miss Kilman. Richard suggests Clarissa rest, then leaves for a committee meeting about ""Armenians"" or ""Albanians.""

Clarissa feels a surge of unhappiness, attributing it to Peter and Richard's unspoken criticisms of her parties. She views her parties as an ""offering"" to life, a way to connect people and create something beautiful. Elizabeth then enters, and Clarissa notes her daughter's unusual seriousness and ""oriental mystery."" Miss Kilman is waiting outside the door, listening. Miss Kilman, who feels cheated by life and views the Dalloways as superficial and privileged, battles intense feelings of hatred and a desire to ""overcome"" Clarissa and Elizabeth through religious conversion. She wants to make Elizabeth hers ""absolutely and forever.""

Elizabeth and Miss Kilman go to the Army and Navy Stores for tea. Miss Kilman's bitterness is evident as she eats and tries to hold onto Elizabeth. Elizabeth, feeling uncomfortable, eventually leaves. Miss Kilman is left feeling ""stricken,"" believing ""Mrs. Dalloway had triumphed. Elizabeth had gone. Beauty had gone, youth had gone."" She then seeks solace in Westminster Abbey, praying to rid herself of hatred and love. Elizabeth, enjoying her newfound freedom, boards an omnibus and finds inspiration in London's busy streets, envisioning a future profession as a doctor or farmer.

Back at his lodgings, Septimus lies on the sofa, with Rezia nearby, sewing a hat. He has a moment of clarity and happiness, helping Rezia design the hat for Mrs. Peters. They laugh together, a rare moment of marital intimacy. He feels proud of the hat. A knock at the door reveals a small girl with an evening paper. Septimus reads about a heat wave. He closes his eyes, feeling happy and tired, but the sounds of Rezia and the child fade, and he is plunged into terror, feeling utterly alone. The visions are gone, replaced by ordinary objects.

Rezia rushes in with news of changed plans and asks about the hat. They reminisce about their first meeting. Septimus then recalls Bradshaw's command that they must be separated. He rages against Bradshaw's power, feeling ""Holmes and Bradshaw are on him!"" He demands to burn his papers, his ""messages from the dead,"" but Rezia saves them, tying them with silk, determined that ""nothing should separate them."" She goes to pack their things.

Hearing Dr. Holmes downstairs, Rezia runs to prevent him from coming up. Holmes insists on seeing Septimus, pushing past Rezia. Septimus, realizing Holmes is forcing his way in, sees his options: Mrs. Filmer’s bread knife, the gas fire. He sits on the window sill. He does not want to die; ""Life was good. The sun hot."" But as Holmes bursts into the room, Septimus cries ""I’ll give it you!"" and flings himself out the window onto Mrs. Filmer’s area railings.

Dr. Holmes, horrified, calls Septimus a ""coward"" and tells Rezia that her husband is ""horribly mangled"" and will not recover. He insists ""no one was in the least to blame."" Rezia drinks something sweet, feeling a detachment, and remembers happy moments with Septimus, contrasting them with his tragic end.

Peter Walsh, passing by, hears the ambulance bell and reflects on the ""triumphs of civilisation"" and the ""privilege of loneliness."" He reaches his hotel and finds a letter from Clarissa, expressing how ""heavenly it was to see him."" He is annoyed by it, feeling it's a typical Clarissa gesture, born of regret but ultimately insincere. He thinks their marriage would not have been a success. He dines alone, but then decides to go to Clarissa's party to confront Richard about India. He feels a sense of anticipation for an ""experience.""

At Clarissa's party, Lucy is busy. The Prime Minister arrives, causing a stir among the guests, particularly Ellie Henderson. Clarissa feels her party is a ""failure,"" but she also sees Peter watching her critically, which brings out her own exaggerated feelings. Richard and Peter greet each other. Clarissa introduces Peter to her aged Aunt Helena. Suddenly, Sally Seton (Lady Rosseter) arrives, embracing Clarissa. They reminisce about their youth.

Wilkins announces ""The Prime Minister,"" who is an ordinary-looking man, but his presence symbolizes English society. Peter observes the snobbery, particularly Hugh Whitbread's deference. Clarissa escorts the Prime Minister, feeling an ""intoxication of the moment,"" but also a ""hollowness."" The sight of a picture reminds her of Miss Kilman, her ""enemy,"" whom she simultaneously hates and loves.

Clarissa circulates among her guests, speaking with Sir Harry, Professor Brierly, and Lord Gayton and Nancy Blow. She is saddened that her young guests don't seem to talk much, wishing for dancing. She briefly talks to Peter and Sally, but tells them she'll return later. Sally and Peter discuss Clarissa, her snobbery, and Peter's own life, including his intention to marry Daisy.

Richard Dalloway talks to the Bradshaws. Lady Bradshaw discreetly informs Clarissa that ""a young man... had killed himself."" Clarissa is profoundly shocked by this news, occurring ""in the middle of my party."" She retreats to a small room, where she visualizes the young man's suicide, leaping from a window onto railings. She reflects on death as ""defiance,"" an ""attempt to communicate,"" and an ""embrace."" She wonders if Sir William Bradshaw, whom she perceives as ""obscurely evil,"" made the young man's life ""intolerable.""

Clarissa feels the young man's death is ""her disaster--her disgrace."" She walks to the window and sees the old lady opposite going to bed, and feels a strange connection to the dead young man. She feels ""glad that he had done it; thrown it away."" The clock strikes, and she feels ""the beauty; made her feel the fun."" She knows she must return to her guests, to Sally and Peter.

Peter and Sally are discussing Clarissa and her alleged snobbery. Sally reveals she has five sons and is now wealthy. Peter admits he has ""not a word"" written despite his past ambitions. They continue to discuss Clarissa and Richard, and the Bradshaws, whom Peter calls ""damnable humbugs."" Elizabeth joins her father, Richard, who had been admiring her beauty without recognizing her at first. Sally observes their devotion and goes to say good-night to Richard, declaring, ""What does the brain matter... compared with the heart?"" Peter is left, filled with a mixture of ""terror"" and ""ecstasy,"" realizing, ""It is Clarissa,"" as the novel concludes with her re-entering the party."
Pride and Prejudice-Jane Austen,"The story begins by introducing the universally acknowledged truth that a single man of good fortune must be in want of a wife. This idea immediately focuses on the arrival of Mr. Bingley, a wealthy young man from the north of England, who has rented Netherfield Park. Mrs. Bennet, whose life's main purpose is to marry off her five daughters—Jane, Elizabeth (Lizzy), Mary, Catherine (Kitty), and Lydia—is overjoyed and determined to secure Bingley for one of them. Mr. Bennet, a man of sarcastic humor and reserve, teases his wife about her schemes but reveals he has already paid Mr. Bingley a visit, surprising his family.

At the Meryton assembly, Mr. Bingley proves to be amiable and popular, dancing frequently with Jane Bennet, whom he finds beautiful. He is accompanied by his two sisters, Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, her husband Mr. Hurst, and his friend Mr. Darcy. Mr. Darcy, a fine, handsome, and wealthy man, quickly draws attention but is soon perceived as proud and disagreeable due to his reserved manners and refusal to dance with many ladies. Elizabeth overhears him remarking that she is ""tolerable, but not handsome enough to tempt me,"" which instantly creates a strong dislike in her for him. Mrs. Bennet is particularly incensed by Darcy's slight to Elizabeth. Despite Darcy's rudeness, the Bennet family, especially Mrs. Bennet, is generally pleased with the ball, as Jane's success with Mr. Bingley is evident.

Elizabeth and Jane discuss the ball, with Jane expressing sincere admiration for Bingley and Elizabeth teasing her for her overly good opinion of people. Elizabeth, however, is critical of Bingley's proud and conceited sisters. The novel provides background on Bingley's acquired wealth through trade and Darcy's inherited fortune and character as haughty and fastidious, contrasting sharply with Bingley's easygoing nature.

The Lucas family, close neighbors to the Bennets, discuss the assembly. Charlotte Lucas, Elizabeth's sensible friend, acknowledges Bingley's admiration for Jane. Mrs. Bennet continues to express her strong dislike for Mr. Darcy. During this conversation, Darcy begins to show an unexpected interest in Elizabeth, observing her intelligence despite his initial dismissal of her looks. Elizabeth remains unaware of this shift, still disliking him for his earlier insult. At a party at Sir William Lucas's, Darcy listens intently to Elizabeth's conversations, leading her to playfully challenge him. Elizabeth plays the pianoforte, followed by her less talented sister, Mary. Sir William Lucas attempts to encourage Darcy to dance with Elizabeth, but she refuses. Miss Bingley, observing Darcy's interest, tries to tease him, but he declares he was ""meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow,"" explicitly naming ""Miss Elizabeth Bennet."" This exchange fuels Miss Bingley's jealousy, leading her to make disparaging remarks about Elizabeth.

Due to Mrs. Bennet's insistence on Jane riding to Netherfield on horseback despite the likelihood of rain, Jane catches a violent cold and is forced to stay at Netherfield. Elizabeth, genuinely concerned, walks three miles through muddy fields to nurse her sister. Her appearance is met with contempt by Miss Bingley and Mrs. Hurst, but with kindness by Mr. Bingley. Mr. Darcy is initially torn between admiration for Elizabeth's ""brightened"" complexion from exercise and doubt about the propriety of her walk. Elizabeth observes the Bingley sisters' indifference to Jane's illness, which reinforces her dislike for them, while Bingley's continued kindness pleases her. Miss Bingley and Mrs. Hurst continue to disparage Elizabeth and her family's low connections, much to Elizabeth's irritation. Darcy, though agreeing that their connections lessen their marriage prospects, defends their agreeable nature against his sisters' ridicule. Darcy experiences an increasing attraction to Elizabeth. Elizabeth and Darcy engage in witty exchanges, with Darcy remarking on his unyielding temper and unforgiving nature, and Elizabeth accusing him of willfully misunderstanding people. Feeling herself too attentive to Elizabeth, Darcy resolves to be more guarded.

Mrs. Bennet attempts to prolong Jane's stay at Netherfield, but Elizabeth insists on their departure, feeling they are intruding. Darcy is pleased by their leaving, as Elizabeth attracts him more than he wishes, and Miss Bingley's teasing has increased.

The Bennet family receives news of a visit from Mr. Collins, a pompous clergyman who is the entailed heir to their estate. His letter expresses a desire for reconciliation and hints at marriage as a form of ""amends"" to one of the daughters. Mr. Collins arrives, a formal, self-important man, who praises Mrs. Bennet's daughters and her home, viewing it as his future property. He constantly praises his patroness, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and her estate, Rosings Park, and describes her sickly but amiable daughter, Miss de Bourgh, whom he believes is destined for Mr. Darcy. Mr. Collins initially intends to propose to Jane, but Mrs. Bennet subtly redirects his attention to Elizabeth, hinting at Jane's likely engagement to Mr. Bingley. Elizabeth becomes his new object of pursuit.

While walking in Meryton with her sisters and Mr. Collins, Elizabeth meets Mr. Wickham, a charming officer. She observes a striking exchange between Wickham and Darcy, where both men change color and exchange a cold, brief greeting. Later, Wickham, seated next to Elizabeth at a dinner at her aunt Mrs. Philips's house, tells her a fabricated story of injustice, claiming Mr. Darcy denied him a valuable church living bequeathed by Darcy's father (Wickham's godfather), due to Darcy's jealousy and pride. Elizabeth is shocked and believes Wickham, cementing her negative opinion of Darcy. Wickham also reveals that Lady Catherine de Bourgh is Darcy's aunt and that Darcy is expected to marry Miss de Bourgh, his cousin, to unite their estates, which makes Elizabeth realize Miss Bingley's hopes for Bingley are in vain.

Bingley and his sisters visit Longbourn to invite the Bennets to a ball at Netherfield. Mrs. Bennet is thrilled, but Elizabeth is dismayed when Mr. Collins claims her for the first two dances, preventing her from dancing with Wickham. At the ball, Wickham is absent, and Mr. Denny implies he stayed away to avoid Darcy. Elizabeth is further angered by Darcy. During her reluctant dance with Darcy, they spar verbally. Elizabeth confronts him about his unforgiving temper and his role in separating Bingley and Jane. Miss Bingley, noticing Darcy's interest in Elizabeth, attempts to undermine Elizabeth by disparaging Wickham, revealing that he is merely the son of Darcy's steward and had behaved infamously. Elizabeth dismisses this as malice. However, Jane, after speaking with Bingley, reports that Bingley vouches for Darcy's character and implies Wickham is not respectable. Elizabeth remains unconvinced, believing Bingley is biased. Mr. Collins, discovering Darcy is Lady Catherine's nephew, introduces himself to Darcy at the ball, much to Elizabeth's mortification. Mrs. Bennet's indiscreet conversations about Jane and Bingley, overheard by Darcy, and Mary's poor singing, further embarrass Elizabeth.

The next morning, Mr. Collins formally proposes to Elizabeth, citing his duty as a clergyman, his personal happiness, and Lady Catherine's advice. He also states his desire to marry one of Mr. Bennet's daughters as ""amends"" for inheriting the estate. Elizabeth firmly refuses him. Mr. Collins, however, misinterprets her refusal as female coyness and expects her to eventually accept. Elizabeth, frustrated, appeals to her father. Mr. Bennet, amusingly, tells Elizabeth that her mother will never see her again if she does *not* marry Mr. Collins, and he will never see her again if she *does*. Mrs. Bennet is enraged by Elizabeth's refusal. Charlotte Lucas, Elizabeth's friend, soon accepts Mr. Collins's proposal, seeking a comfortable home and financial security rather than love. Elizabeth is shocked and dismayed by Charlotte's pragmatic decision, feeling it compromises her friend's dignity.

Jane receives a letter from Caroline Bingley announcing the Bingley party's abrupt departure from Netherfield for London, with no intention of returning. The letter implies Bingley is becoming attached to Miss Darcy and hopes they will marry. Elizabeth correctly interprets this as Miss Bingley's scheme to separate Bingley from Jane, and to secure a wealthy marriage for her brother with Miss Darcy. Jane is heartbroken but tries to maintain her good opinion of Caroline.

Elizabeth travels to Hunsford with Sir William and Maria Lucas to visit the newly married Collinses. She observes Charlotte's contentment in her practical marriage. During her stay, Mr. Darcy and his cousin, Colonel Fitzwilliam, arrive at Rosings Park to visit Lady Catherine. Darcy and Fitzwilliam frequently call at the parsonage. Elizabeth finds Colonel Fitzwilliam agreeable. During a walk, Colonel Fitzwilliam reveals to Elizabeth that Darcy had ""lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage,"" without naming the friend. Elizabeth immediately deduces he is referring to Bingley and Jane, confirming her suspicion that Darcy deliberately separated them. This solidifies her anger and contempt for Darcy.

Later, Mr. Darcy unexpectedly calls on Elizabeth and proposes marriage, confessing his ardent love but also dwelling on his struggles to overcome her inferior connections and family's improprieties. Elizabeth, furious, refuses him vehemently, accusing him of ruining Jane's happiness and cruelly treating Mr. Wickham. Darcy, shocked, admits he actively separated Bingley and Jane due to Jane's supposed indifference and her family's lack of propriety. He then gives Elizabeth a long letter, explaining his true history with Wickham: Wickham was the son of Darcy's late father's steward, given financial support and the prospect of a church living, but squandered it through idleness and dissipation, later trying to elope with Darcy's 15-year-old sister, Georgiana, for her £30,000 fortune. Darcy intervened to protect his sister.

Elizabeth is deeply shocked and humbled by Darcy's letter. She realizes her prejudice against Darcy and her partiality for Wickham had blinded her. She feels shame for her misjudgments and for her family's conduct. She understands that Darcy's objections to Jane's family were valid and that Wickham is a scoundrel. She feels a mixture of respect and gratitude towards Darcy for his honor and generosity, especially concerning his sister.

The regiment leaves Meryton, much to Kitty and Lydia's dismay. Lydia receives an invitation to Brighton with Mrs. Forster, the colonel's wife. Elizabeth tries to dissuade her father from allowing Lydia to go, citing Lydia's wildness and the negative impact on the family's reputation. Mr. Bennet, however, permits it, believing it will teach Lydia a lesson. Elizabeth has a final tense conversation with Wickham, subtly revealing her knowledge of his true character. Lydia leaves enthusiastically for Brighton.

Elizabeth goes on her curtailed summer tour to Derbyshire with her aunt and uncle, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner. They visit Pemberley, Darcy's estate, while believing he is away. Elizabeth is deeply impressed by the beauty of the house and grounds, and by the housekeeper's glowing account of Mr. Darcy as a kind master, landlord, and brother, contrasting sharply with Wickham's portrayal. Unexpectedly, Mr. Darcy returns early and encounters Elizabeth and the Gardiners at Pemberley. He is civil and attentive, surprising Elizabeth and her aunt and uncle. He invites them to dinner the next day and asks to introduce his sister, Georgiana. The Gardiners observe Darcy's clear partiality for Elizabeth.

At Pemberley, Elizabeth is introduced to the shy and amiable Miss Darcy. Mr. Bingley also arrives, expressing his unaffected cordiality. Miss Bingley, still present, attempts to insult Elizabeth by mentioning the Meryton militia and Wickham. Darcy defends Elizabeth, and later, when Miss Bingley criticizes Elizabeth's looks, Darcy declares Elizabeth to be ""one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance.""

Elizabeth receives two urgent letters from Jane, revealing Lydia has eloped with Wickham from Brighton. The second letter confirms Wickham has no intention of marrying her. Jane reports that Mr. Bennet is in London searching for them, and implores Mr. Gardiner's help. Elizabeth, distraught, accidentally encounters Darcy again and tearfully reveals Lydia's disgrace. Darcy is visibly distressed. He offers his assistance to the Gardiners, who are rushing to London. Elizabeth feels she has lost any chance with Darcy due to her family's shame.

Mr. Gardiner finds Lydia and Wickham in London. Wickham had never intended to marry Lydia. Darcy, feeling responsible for not exposing Wickham's true character earlier, finds them and negotiates the marriage himself. He pays off Wickham's substantial gambling debts and buys him a commission in a northern regiment, also settling an additional £1000 on Lydia, beyond her eventual inheritance. He insists on bearing all the expense, refusing Mr. Gardiner's offer to share it, stating it was his duty to remedy the situation caused by his own pride and reserve. Mr. Bennet is informed of the settlement and reluctantly agrees to Lydia marrying Wickham, though he refuses to provide new clothes or receive them at Longbourn. Mrs. Bennet, however, is ecstatic about Lydia's marriage, ignoring the scandalous circumstances. Elizabeth is deeply grateful and humbled by Darcy's magnanimity, realizing he did it for her sake.

Mr. Bennet is eventually persuaded by Jane and Elizabeth to allow Lydia and Wickham to visit Longbourn after their marriage. Lydia arrives, unabashed and boastful of her marriage. She casually mentions that Mr. Darcy was present at her wedding. Elizabeth, astonished, writes to Mrs. Gardiner for an explanation. Mrs. Gardiner's reply confirms Darcy's extraordinary role in arranging and financing the marriage, and she expresses her high esteem for him. Elizabeth is overwhelmed by gratitude and a newfound love for Darcy.

Bingley returns to Netherfield and quickly renews his attentions to Jane. Mrs. Bennet's persistent efforts to leave them alone finally lead to Bingley proposing to Jane, who joyfully accepts. The family is delighted. Mr. Bennet, though teasing, expresses his sincere happiness for Jane.

Lady Catherine de Bourgh, having heard a rumor of Darcy's impending marriage to Elizabeth, unexpectedly visits Longbourn to demand that Elizabeth promise never to marry Darcy, asserting Darcy is destined for her own daughter. Elizabeth firmly refuses, defending her right to choose. Lady Catherine is enraged and departs. Elizabeth realizes that Lady Catherine's aggressive interference actually gave Darcy hope that Elizabeth was not entirely against him, as she would have explicitly denied her feelings if she intended to marry someone else.

Darcy returns to Longbourn. Elizabeth, seizing the moment, thanks him for his kindness to Lydia. Darcy admits his actions were partly motivated by his desire to make her happy, acknowledging he thought ""only of you."" He then confesses his feelings for her are unchanged and asks if hers are still as they were. Elizabeth, with embarrassment, admits her sentiments have changed and she receives his assurances with gratitude and pleasure. Darcy reveals Lady Catherine's visit, which, by prompting Elizabeth's steadfast refusal to promise not to marry him, gave him hope that she was not irrevocably against him. He also explains how her reproof of his initial arrogant proposal ""tortured"" him and led him to self-reflection and humility. He admits his initial purpose for returning to Netherfield was to see her and gauge her feelings.

Mr. Bennet gives his consent to Elizabeth's marriage to Darcy, after Elizabeth explains her change of heart and reveals Darcy's generosity to Lydia. Mrs. Bennet is ecstatic about Elizabeth marrying such a wealthy and distinguished man, her earlier dislike for him vanishing entirely. She focuses on the grand benefits of the match. Mr. Bennet dryly comments on his daughters' successful marriages.

Miss Bingley is mortified by Darcy's marriage but quickly sets aside her resentment to maintain social standing. Lady Catherine de Bourgh is initially indignant and sends an abusive letter, but Elizabeth eventually persuades Darcy to seek reconciliation. Lady Catherine's resentment gives way to curiosity and affection, and she visits them at Pemberley.

Bingley and Jane remain at Netherfield for a year, then move to an estate closer to Pemberley. Kitty, removed from Lydia's influence, matures. Mary remains at home. Wickham and Lydia, however, remain extravagant and heedless, frequently needing financial assistance from Jane and Elizabeth. Darcy, for Elizabeth's sake, helps Wickham in his profession.

The story concludes with Darcy and Elizabeth happily married at Pemberley, and Bingley and Jane settled nearby. They maintain close relationships with the Gardiners. Darcy's initial pride and Elizabeth's initial prejudice are overcome through self-reflection, understanding, and the revealing of true character, leading to a loving and respectful union."
Robinson Crusoe-Daniel Defoe,"The narrative begins with Robinson Crusoe, born in York in 1632 to a German father and an English mother from the Robinson family. His original name was Kreutznaer, but it was corrupted to Crusoe. He had two elder brothers; one was killed in Flanders, the fate of the other is unknown. Despite his aging father's earnest advice to settle into a ""middle state"" of life to avoid misery and hardship, Robinson was filled with ""rambling thoughts"" and a strong desire to go to sea. His father tearfully warned him against this ""foolish step,"" predicting God would not bless him.

Initially affected, Robinson soon forgot his resolution. At eighteen, he tried to persuade his mother to let him make one voyage, promising to return if he disliked it. His mother refused, and his father, upon hearing of it, sighed that Robinson would be ""the most miserable wretch that ever was born"" if he went abroad.

Almost a year later, in September 1651, Robinson went to Hull and, without his parents' blessing, embarked on a ship bound for London with a companion. Immediately, a violent storm arose, terrifying him and prompting vows of repentance. However, when the storm abated, his companion mocked his fears, and Robinson, drinking punch, drowned his repentance and resolutions. Six days later, while anchored in Yarmouth Roads, an even more dreadful storm struck. The ship became disabled, sprang a leak, and the crew, including Robinson, worked desperately at the pumps. They were rescued by a boat from another ship, and minutes later, their ship sank. All eleven men in the boat eventually reached shore near Yarmouth.

Despite this ""visible instruction,"" Robinson's ""ill fate"" compelled him to continue. Ashamed to return home, he travelled to London by land. His former companion's father, who was the master of the shipwrecked vessel, warned him against going to sea again, suggesting his misfortunes were a sign from Heaven. Robinson was undeterred.

In London, he met a shipmaster who had been to Guinea (Africa) and offered him free passage as a messmate. Robinson, with £40 worth of goods, made this his first successful venture, learning navigation and returning with nearly £300 in gold-dust. This success fueled his ambition. The honest captain, his friend, died soon after. Robinson, with £200 of his earnings, embarked on a second voyage to Guinea with the former mate, now captain. This proved disastrous. Their ship was attacked and captured by a Turkish rover from Sallee. Robinson was taken to Sallee, a port of the Moors, and became the rover captain's slave for two years, performing household chores and looking after the ship.

He constantly plotted escape. An opportunity arose when his master often went fishing, taking Robinson and a boy named Xury. Robinson used the master's refitted long-boat, intended for fishing, to escape. He tricked a Moorish kinsman into loading provisions and ammunition, then tossed the Moor overboard and threatened to shoot him if he tried to return. The Moor swam to shore. Robinson secured the loyalty of the boy, Xury, who swore fidelity.

He steered south along the African coast for five days, covering 150 miles beyond the Emperor of Morocco's dominions. They landed for fresh water, encountering wild beasts at night. Xury bravely shot a hare-like creature for food. They continued south, encountering naked black natives who traded dried meat and corn for signs of thanks. Robinson shot a leopard that attacked them, astonishing the natives, who then helped him secure the skin and offered more food and water.

After eleven more days, they reached the Cape de Verde Islands. Spotting a Portuguese ship, Robinson signaled distress. A Scottish sailor on board helped him communicate, and the captain, hearing of his escape from slavery, took them aboard. The generous captain refused payment, promising safe passage and delivery of all his goods in Brazil. He bought Robinson's boat for 80 pieces of eight and Xury for 60 pieces of eight, promising Xury freedom in ten years if he became a Christian.

They arrived in Brazil, where Robinson, with the proceeds from his goods (around 220 pieces of eight), became a planter. He bought land, acquired a Black slave and two European servants, and began cultivating tobacco and sugar cane. He arranged for £100 of his money from London to be sent to him in goods, which arrived with tools. This initial success and prosperity again led to ambition. After four years, he agreed to join three fellow planters on a secret, illegal slave-trading voyage to Guinea, acting as supercargo for a share of the slaves, despite the risks and leaving his thriving plantation behind. He made a will, naming the Portuguese captain his heir.

On September 1, 1659, exactly eight years after his first ill-fated voyage, Robinson set sail. After crossing the equator, a violent hurricane drove them for twelve days, claiming one life and washing two others overboard. The ship was disabled and leaking. They changed course for Barbados, but a second storm struck. The ship ran aground near an unknown island. All eleven men in the boat, including Robinson, were then caught by a raging wave and swallowed by the sea. Robinson was the only survivor, washed ashore, half-dead, and bruised against rocks.

Stranded, he found fresh water and slept in a tree for safety from wild beasts. The next morning, he discovered the ship had floated closer to shore. He swam to it and, over several days, made eleven trips on a self-built raft, salvaging provisions (food, rum), tools (carpenter's chest, grindstone, hatchets, saws, axes), weapons (guns, pistols, powder, shot, swords), clothes, bedding, and even money (which he initially considered useless). On his last trip, a storm broke up the ship completely.

He built a fortified habitation: a tent under a rock face, surrounded by a double fence of stakes and cables, further reinforced with earth. He dug a cave behind it, creating various compartments. A lightning storm made him fear for his gunpowder, so he divided it into many small, hidden parcels. He established a daily routine of hunting (killing goats and fowls), exploring, and working on his habitation. To keep track of time, he cut notches on a large post. He found he had salvaged Bibles, other books, pens, ink, and paper. His dog had swum ashore, and he kept two cats.

Robinson fell ill with a violent ague, experiencing a profound spiritual awakening. He prayed earnestly, reflected on his past sins, and found solace in reading the Bible. He discovered corn and rice growing from spoiled chicken feed he had discarded, seeing it as a sign of Providence. He carefully harvested and replanted, eventually learning to cultivate two crops a year. He also made basic pottery, a wooden mortar, and sieves from old neckcloths to process his grain, and learned to bake bread. He built a ""country bower"" or second dwelling in a fruitful valley on the island, complete with its own fence.

After several years, he built a large canoe, but realized it was too heavy to launch. He then built a smaller periagua (canoe) and, after digging a canal, successfully launched it into the creek. On a voyage to circumnavigate the island, he was caught in a strong current and swept far out to sea, again fearing loss. He eventually found an eddy and, using a favorable wind, returned to the island. This terrifying experience made him resolve to stop venturing out to sea.

During his eleventh year, he started breeding tame goats to ensure a steady food supply as his powder dwindled. He set pitfalls and caught three kids, which he successfully tamed. He built strong enclosures for his growing flock, eventually having over 40 goats, and learned to make butter and cheese.

In his twenty-third year, while harvesting, he saw a fire on his side of the island. He took defensive measures and, from a hill with his spyglass, observed nine naked savages engaged in a cannibal feast. He was filled with horror and rage, considering an attack, but ultimately decided against it, believing it was not his place to judge or punish them. He relocated his boat to a hidden cove to avoid discovery.

A year and a half later, in his twenty-fourth year, a storm brought a shipwreck to the east side of his island. He heard distress guns and lit a signal fire. The next day, he found the wreck of a Spanish ship and, to his sorrow, a drowned boy. He was overwhelmed with a longing for human companionship. He ventured to the wreck, finding a living dog (which he rescued) and the bodies of two drowned men. He salvaged useful items, including a large quantity of money which he considered useless but took anyway, and some provisions.

Robinson continued to live in heightened caution. After two more years, he had a vivid dream of savages landing with a prisoner, who escaped and ran to his grove. In the dream, he rescued the savage, who became his servant. This dream spurred him to actively seek a servant/companion.

One morning, he observed five canoes and thirty savages on his side of the island, preparing another cannibal feast with two prisoners. He positioned himself with Friday (his newly acquired servant, whom he named after the day of his rescue). Friday, an agile and loyal young savage, was about to be eaten by his enemies. Robinson, overriding his moral scruples, intervened, shooting some of the pursuers and knocking down another. Friday, amazed by the guns, then skillfully beheaded the stunned savage with Robinson's sword. They burned the remains of the feast.

To Robinson's great joy, the second prisoner turned out to be Friday's father. After their emotional reunion, Robinson, Friday, and his father (a ""Pagan and a cannibal"") and the rescued Spaniard (a ""Papist"") formed a small community. Robinson gave them clothes, provided food, and instructed Friday and his father in Christianity. Friday proved a quick and loyal student.

The escaped savages, terrified by the ""thunder and lightning"" of the guns, never returned. The Spaniard recounted that sixteen of his countrymen and Portuguese were shipwrecked on the mainland, living among savages, but in dire need. Robinson, after much deliberation and securing a solemn oath of fidelity from the Spaniard, agreed to help them. They expanded their plantations for six months to ensure enough provisions for the larger group.

When ready, the Spaniard and Friday's father departed in a canoe to retrieve the others. Eight days later, Friday rushed to Robinson, announcing the arrival of another boat. Robinson, from his lookout, saw an English ship at anchor and an English long-boat landing. A ""secret hint"" filled him with suspicion. He observed mutineers landing with three bound prisoners. He learned from the ship's captain, one of the prisoners, that his crew had mutinied.

Robinson, with Friday, the captain, his mate, and a passenger, strategically attacked the mutineers. They rescued the three prisoners, disabled one of the mutineers' boats, and captured some of the mutineers on shore. Robinson (presenting himself as ""Governor"" of the island with a large army) forced the captured mutineers to cooperate in recovering the ship. The captain, with his loyal men and some re-armed former mutineers, successfully retook the ship after a brief struggle that resulted in the death of the rebel captain.

Overwhelmed with joy and gratitude, Robinson received abundant provisions and new clothes from the captain. He offered the remaining incorrigible mutineers the choice of being left on the island or taken to England for trial and probable hanging. They chose to stay. Robinson provided them with firearms, tools, seeds, and instructions on how to survive, making them promise to treat the expected Spaniards well. He also sent two of the originally unrepentant mutineers, who had since begged for mercy, to the ship.

On December 19, 1686, after twenty-eight years, two months, and nineteen days, Robinson left the island. He took his goat-skin cap, umbrella, one parrot, and the money he had salvaged. He arrived in England in June 1687. He found his father and mother dead, and his family mostly extinct, but discovered two sisters and two nephews. He rewarded his old benefactress, the widow, and his sisters. The ship owners also gave him £200 for saving their vessel.

Driven by a desire to check on his Brazil plantation, he travelled to Lisbon with Friday. He was reunited with his old Portuguese captain, who informed him of the great wealth his plantation had accumulated over the years, despite the king and a monastery having taken a share. Robinson generously rewarded the old captain and his son, granting them annuities from his estate. He then secured his claim to the plantation, receiving bills of exchange and a vast cargo of sugar, tobacco, and gold.

Now extremely wealthy, Robinson, after initial sickness from the shock of his good fortune, distributed his wealth further. He resolved against sea travel again, due to past misfortunes and a ""strong impulse"" to avoid it. He chose to travel by land through France, accompanied by Friday and several other gentlemen and servants. They faced a perilous journey through the snow-covered Pyrenees, encountering and fighting off multiple wolf attacks, and Friday bravely killing a bear.

After many adventures and challenges, they reached Dover, England, in January. Robinson settled his affairs, sold his Brazilian estate, and married, having three children. His wife died. Years later, influenced by his adventurous nephew, Robinson, though old, embarked on a new voyage to the East Indies in 1694. On this journey, he revisited his island. He found the men he had left there, along with the Spaniards, who had faced their own struggles against mutineers and Caribbean invaders. The Spaniards had also rescued more men and women, resulting in about twenty children on the island. Robinson stayed twenty days, providing supplies, arms, and two workmen (a carpenter and a smith). He divided the land among them, reserving ultimate property rights for himself. He then sent more settlers and livestock (cows, sheep, hogs) from Brazil. The narrative concludes with a promise to recount further surprising incidents from his subsequent ten years of adventures in a second part of his story."
Six Characters in Search of an Author-Luigi Pirandello,"The play opens on a bare stage set for a rehearsal of a Pirandello play, ""Mixing It Up."" The theatrical company, including a Manager, a Prompter, and various actors, is preparing for the second act. The Manager expresses his frustration with modern comedies and Pirandello's work, which he finds absurd and difficult to understand. He instructs the Property Man on set details and bickers with a Leading Man about wearing a cook's cap, explaining the symbolic meaning of the part.

During this rehearsal, six mysterious figures—The Father, The Mother, The Step-Daughter, The Son, The Boy, and The Child—enter the stage, surrounded by a faint, dreamlike light. They interrupt the rehearsal, stating they are ""characters in search of an author"" because the author who created them abandoned their drama. The Manager and actors are initially annoyed and skeptical, believing the newcomers to be mad.

The Father explains that they carry an unfinished drama within them and seek someone to stage it. The Step-Daughter, vivacious and impudent, quickly engages, suggesting they could be the Manager's new play. She alludes to her ""passion"" for the Father and reveals that she, The Boy, and The Child are the Mother's illegitimate children, despised by The Son, who is the Father's legitimate son. The Mother, dressed in black and seemingly crushed by shame, attempts to prevent the full story from being revealed.

Through a series of urgent and conflicting revelations, the Characters' story unfolds:
The Father states that The Mother had a lover, who has recently died, and that her drama revolves around her four children by two men. The Mother protests, claiming the Father forced her to leave him and their first son (The Son) to live with the other man. The Step-Daughter disputes this, saying The Mother lived happily with her second partner and only blames the Father to appease The Son, whom she abandoned.

The Father admits he sent The Mother away, well-provided for, to be free of him, but also admits it was a liberation for himself. He claims he later watched over the new family, particularly the Step-Daughter, out of ""pure interest."" The Step-Daughter confirms he used to follow her from school, bringing her gifts, which her mother eventually noticed.

The drama intensifies when The Father describes his own ""wretchedness"" as a man seeking female companionship. He reveals that after the Step-Daughter's second father died, The Mother and her three children fell into misery and returned to the city, unknown to him. The Mother began working as a modiste for Madame Pace, a woman who used poor girls to attract clients. The Step-Daughter recounts how she herself was exploited by Madame Pace and how, one day, The Father entered the shop and was about to engage in a shameful act with her (the Step-Daughter) before The Mother arrived and recognized him. The Father claims he recognized The Mother ""in time"" and brought them all back to his house.

The Son expresses profound disgust and shame at this entire narrative, declaring himself an ""unrealized character"" who wants no part in their ""vulgar"" drama. He feels like an intruder in his own home. The Father, however, insists The Son is central to the action, particularly in his cruel aloofness towards his reunited mother and the younger children. He explains that the full drama culminates in the disappearance of the extraneous family (Step-Daughter, Boy, Child) and the resulting desolation between himself, The Mother, and The Son.

Despite the chaotic and deeply personal nature of the Characters' story, the Manager becomes increasingly intrigued, seeing its potential for a ""drama."" The Father proposes that the Manager become their author and stage their story, taking it down scene by scene as they perform it. The Manager, though initially hesitant, is tempted by the novelty and agrees to try. The performance is then interrupted for a brief meeting in the Manager's office.

**Act II** begins after the interruption. The Step-Daughter, The Boy, and The Child emerge from the office. The Step-Daughter expresses dissatisfaction with the arrangements and playfully tells The Child that they are about to ""act a comedy, dead serious."" She notices The Boy holding a revolver and mockingly suggests he should shoot the Father and Son instead of himself. The Son enters, lamenting his inability to escape the situation and his shame at having his family's private life exposed.

The Manager returns with The Father and The Step-Daughter, and they begin preparing the stage for Madame Pace's shop, with The Step-Daughter meticulously insisting on details like a yellow, flowered sofa and a specific small table. The Manager instructs the Prompter to take down the dialogue in shorthand.

The Manager then tries to cast the actors in the Characters' roles. The Characters strongly object, especially The Step-Daughter, who finds the Leading Lady utterly unlike her. The Father argues that actors cannot truly embody their inherent ""temperaments"" and ""souls,"" which are their fixed reality, whereas the actors merely ""pretend."" The Manager asserts that the actors give ""body and form"" to the characters and that the ""spirit of the piece"" is created by their performance, not inherent in the Characters themselves.

To everyone's surprise, when the stage is set for Madame Pace's shop (with hats and cloaks from the actresses hung up), Madame Pace herself materializes on stage, drawn by the ""articles of her trade."" The scene between the Step-Daughter and Madame Pace spontaneously begins, with Madame Pace speaking in a comical, unintelligible jargon. The Mother, previously quiet, suddenly cries out, calling Madame Pace a ""murderess.""

The Step-Daughter then directs The Father in his entry, instructing him on his tone and gestures. As The Father performs the scene where he offers the Step-Daughter a hat, The Mother watches in anguished sobs. The Step-Daughter delivers a line about being in mourning, and The Father replies, ""Ah well, then let's take off this little frock."" The Manager, horrified, tries to cut the line, deeming it unsuitable for the stage. The Step-Daughter vehemently insists on the ""truth"" of her experience, including the Father's proposition and her subsequent disgust, threatening to leave if the scene is not accurately portrayed. She asserts that the Father is responsible for her ""faults"" even before her birth.

The Mother, overwhelmed, explains that her torment is ""not a pretended one"" and that she ""lives and feels every minute of my torture,"" with the children serving to make her suffering ""actual and vivid."" The Father adds that The Step-Daughter is here to ""fix me, and hold me eternally in the stocks for that one fleeting and shameful moment of my life."" The Step-Daughter physically re-enacts the near-encounter, leaning on the Father's chest and describing feeling a vein pulse, which awakened ""disgust."" She prompts The Mother to ""Cry out as you did then!"" The Mother cries out and rushes to separate them, calling the Father a ""brute."" The Manager, pleased with the dramatic climax, calls for the curtain, which is then accidentally lowered completely by the Machinist.

**Act III** opens with the stage crew having quickly changed the scenery to a garden with trees and a fountain basin. The Characters are grouped, with The Son still aloof. The Manager discusses the challenges of staging multiple locations simultaneously. The Father passionately objects to the use of the word ""illusion,"" explaining that what is a ""game of art"" for the actors is the Characters' ""sole reality,"" a fixed and immutable reality that contrasts with the transitory nature of human existence. He argues that characters have a life independent of their authors.

The Manager, growing frustrated with the Father's ""philosophizing,"" insists on action over discussion. The Step-Daughter describes her only pleasure as seeing The Child play happily in the garden, away from their shared squalor. She alludes to The Boy being ""consumed"" by some ""project"" indoors.

The Manager attempts to stage a scene in the garden. The Step-Daughter declares The Boy will not speak as long as The Son is present, prompting The Son to try to leave. The Step-Daughter stops him, asserting he ""can't go away"" as he is ""indissolubly bound to the chain."" The Son defiantly states he will not act, insisting he was dragged there by The Father and that the author never wanted them on stage. He claims he walked out of his room to avoid a scene with The Mother.

The Manager presses The Son for details about what happened next in the garden. The Son reluctantly reveals that he saw The Child in the fountain. The Father adds that The Mother was following The Son at that moment. The Son then describes running to save The Child, but seeing The Boy standing motionless, ""with eyes like a madman's, watching his little drowned sister, in the fountain!"" As The Step-Daughter bends over the fountain prop, sobbing, a revolver shot rings out from behind the trees where The Boy is hidden.

The Mother screams and rushes towards the sound. Actors declare The Boy is ""dead!"", while others claim it's ""only make believe, it's only pretence!"" The Father cries out, ""Pretence? Reality, sir, reality!"" The Manager, utterly exasperated and frustrated by the day's events, dismisses it all, declaring, ""To hell with it all! Never in my life has such a thing happened to me. I've lost a whole day over these people, a whole day!"" The curtain falls."
The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn-Mark Twain,"Huckleberry Finn (Huck) begins by explaining that he and Tom Sawyer became rich after finding money hidden by robbers in a cave, each receiving $6,000. Judge Thatcher invested their money, providing a dollar a day. Huck was adopted by the Widow Douglas, who tried to ""sivilize"" him with proper manners, clothes, and religious instruction from her sister, Miss Watson. Finding this life stifling, Huck ran away, but Tom Sawyer convinced him to return by promising him a place in a new band of robbers.

That night, Huck secretly met Tom. While sneaking through the Widow's garden, they narrowly avoided being discovered by Jim, Miss Watson's slave, who later boasted that witches rode him all over the state, a story that earned him local fame. The boys then gathered other friends (Joe Harper, Ben Rogers) and went to a hidden cave to form ""Tom Sawyer's Gang."" The gang took a blood oath to keep secrets and kill anyone who wronged a member's family. When it was pointed out Huck had no family to avenge, he offered Miss Watson. They planned to be ""highwaymen,"" robbing and murdering travelers, and sometimes holding people for ""ransom"" (a concept Tom didn't fully understand but insisted on because it was ""in the books""). They agreed to avoid killing women, instead bringing them to the cave to fall in love with the robbers. The gang's first ""adventure"" involved ambushing a ""Spanish merchants and A-rabs"" caravan, which turned out to be a Sunday-school picnic. Huck became disillusioned with Tom's fantastical adventures, especially when his attempt to summon genies from a lamp failed.

After several months of school, Huck saw distinctive boot tracks in the snow, realizing his abusive, drunken father, Pap, had returned. Fearing Pap would take his money, Huck went to Judge Thatcher and tried to give him all his wealth, which the Judge ""bought"" for a dollar. Huck then consulted Jim and his magic hair-ball, which predicted Huck would have trouble and joy, eventually marry, avoid water, and be hung. That night, Pap confronted Huck in his room, berating him for being ""sivilized"" and educated, and demanding his money. Pap took Huck's dollar for whiskey and threatened to beat him if he continued school. Pap tried to get Huck's money from Judge Thatcher through the courts, but a new judge wouldn't separate them. Pap spent borrowed money on alcohol, leading to jailings. Pap eventually kidnapped Huck, taking him to a secluded log cabin on the Illinois shore.

Pap kept Huck locked in the cabin, beating him frequently, especially when drunk. Huck initially enjoyed the free, wild life but eventually resolved to escape the constant abuse and confinement. During one of Pap's three-day absences, Huck found an old saw and began cutting through a log in the cabin wall. He devised an elaborate plan to fake his own death: he killed a wild pig, used its blood to stage a murder scene, smashed the cabin door, and created false trails leading away from the river to suggest robbers had killed him. He then hid in a stolen canoe on Jackson's Island.

On the island, Huck discovered Jim, Miss Watson's runaway slave, who was hiding after overhearing Miss Watson planning to sell him to New Orleans for $800. Jim was terrified, believing Huck was a ghost, but Huck reassured him. They decided to travel together down the Mississippi River on a raft. They appropriated a section of a lumber raft. One night, they boarded a wrecked steamboat to look for loot. Huck overheard three robbers (Jim Turner, Bill, and Jake Packard) arguing, with Bill wanting to kill Turner. Packard convinced Bill to leave Turner tied up to drown when the wreck broke up, avoiding the ""risk"" of murder. Huck and Jim escaped in the robbers' skiff just as their own raft broke loose. Huck felt pity for the trapped murderers and tried to get help for them from a ferryboat watchman, fabricating a story about a stranded family, but the wreck floated away before help could reach them.

Huck and Jim found their raft and continued downriver. They missed Cairo, the entrance to the free states, in a fog, realizing they were now traveling deeper into slave territory. A steamboat then accidentally smashed their raft, separating them. Huck swam to shore and stumbled upon the Grangerford family's house. He introduced himself as George Jackson and was welcomed into their home. He learned about the long-standing, violent feud between the Grangerfords and the Shepherdsons, which had resulted in many deaths on both sides. He befriended Buck Grangerford, a boy his age. He observed their strict, aristocratic ways and the pervasive violence. Miss Sophia Grangerford secretly used Huck to retrieve a note from church, which read ""Half past two."" Later, Jim (Huck's Jim) found Huck, revealing he had followed him and that the Grangerford ""niggers"" had helped him hide and even repaired their broken raft. Jim explained that Miss Sophia had run off to marry Harney Shepherdson, sparking a renewed outbreak of the feud. Huck witnessed a bloody gunfight between the families, seeing Buck and his cousin Joe shot while trying to escape into the river. Huck was horrified and fled. He found Jim, and they escaped on the repaired raft.

Further downriver, they picked up two con artists: an old man who claimed to be the rightful Duke of Bridgewater, and a younger man who claimed to be the lost Dauphin, Louis XVII of France. Huck quickly recognized them as frauds but played along to keep the peace. The ""duke"" and ""king"" immediately began devising schemes. They learned about the death of Peter Wilks and decided to impersonate his long-lost English brothers, Harvey (the preacher) and William (the deaf-mute). They gathered information about the family from a young man on a steamboat.

Upon arriving in the town, the ""king"" and ""duke"" put on a grand show of grief, convincing the townspeople and Peter Wilks's nieces (Mary Jane, Susan, and Joanna) of their identity. The will was read, revealing $6,000 in gold. Discovering they were $415 short, the king and duke made up the difference from their own money to maintain the illusion of legitimacy. The ""duke"" then had the brilliant idea to give the entire $6,000 to the girls, further cementing the town's trust. Only Dr. Robinson and lawyer Levi Bell suspected them, but their warnings were dismissed by the emotional townspeople. Huck, disgusted by the frauds, stole the $6,000 from their hiding place in the king's room, intending to give it back to the girls. He hid the money in Peter Wilks's coffin.

During the funeral, Huck was anxious about the money's discovery. The undertaker screwed down the coffin lid, leaving Huck uncertain if the money was still inside. The ""king"" then announced he and ""William"" would take the girls to England and immediately put all of Peter Wilks's property, including his slaves, up for auction. Huck was horrified when the ""king"" sold the ""niggers,"" separating a mother from her children. Huck told Mary Jane the truth about the frauds and the money's location, convincing her to leave town so her face wouldn't betray her. He then convinced Mary Jane's sisters that she was visiting a sick friend, inventing a fantastical illness (the ""pluribus-unum mumps"") to explain her sudden departure and prevent them from telling the ""uncles.""

Just as the auction was ending, the real Harvey and William Wilks arrived. A chaotic scene ensued, with Dr. Robinson and Levi Bell challenging the ""duke"" and ""king."" The townspeople demanded proof of identity. The ""king"" and the real Harvey Wilks were both asked to write, revealing the ""king's"" illegible scrawl and Harvey's (copied by William) more convincing hand. The real Harvey then asked what was tattooed on Peter Wilks's breast. The ""king"" guessed a ""blue arrow,"" but the men who laid out the corpse denied it. Harvey then claimed it was ""P—B—W."" The men again denied any marks. The crowd, now enraged, decided to dig up the corpse to verify. As they dug, Huck escaped in the confusion, but was intercepted by the ""king"" and ""duke"" who had also fled.

Huck lied to the ""king"" and ""duke"" that he had escaped when the gold was discovered, and that he was worried about their safety. The ""king"" and ""duke"" then had a furious argument, accusing each other of trying to double-cross the other by hiding the gold in the coffin. They eventually reconciled, both drunk. Huck, feeling he had to steal Jim out of slavery again, hid the raft and went to the Phelps plantation, where he discovered Jim was being held. Tom Sawyer then arrived and, to Huck's astonishment, agreed to help him ""steal"" Jim, but only by enacting a wildly elaborate and unnecessary escape plan full of ""style"" and ""adventure,"" involving digging a tunnel with case-knives, making a rope ladder from sheets, and collecting various animals (rats, spiders, snakes) to keep Jim company. They even tricked Aunt Sally into believing that missing items (spoons, sheets, candles) were due to rats and her own absent-mindedness.

As they finalized their plan, Tom wrote anonymous warning letters to the Phelps family and staged signs (skull and crossbones, coffin) to terrorize them, claiming a gang of cutthroats was coming to steal Jim. He also wrote a final letter, supposedly from a reformed gang member, instructing the Phelpses to ambush the ""cutthroats"" by locking them in the cabin. The night of the escape, Huck, dressed in Aunt Sally's clothes, snuck to the cellar for butter. Aunt Sally caught him, thinking he had ""brain-fever"" as the butter melted down his face, and sent him to bed. Huck rushed to Tom, telling him the house was full of armed farmers waiting for the ambush. Tom, delighted by the added danger, insisted on proceeding. As the farmers entered the cabin, Huck, Jim, and Tom slipped out through their dug tunnel. Tom's britches caught on the fence, making a noise, and the farmers opened fire. They escaped through the woods, with the Phelps's dogs (who recognized them) running past them towards the noise. They reached their canoe and then the raft.

Tom revealed he had been shot in the calf. Jim refused to proceed without a doctor. Huck went to town, lying to a doctor that his brother had shot himself while hunting on an island. The doctor took Huck's canoe to treat Tom. Huck returned to the Phelps's, lying to Uncle Silas that he and ""Sid"" (Tom) had been out hunting the runaway ""nigger."" At dinner, the townspeople discussed the bizarre escape attempts from Jim's cabin, blaming the ""nigger's"" madness and accusing others of helping him. Aunt Sally, exhausted, confessed she had locked Huck and Tom in their room for safety. She pleaded with Huck (thinking he was Tom) not to go out again for her sake. The next morning, Aunt Sally received a letter from Tom's real Aunt Polly, who soon arrived. She revealed that the ""Tom"" at the house was actually Huck, and that the real Tom had been pretending to be Sid. She also revealed that Miss Watson had died two months ago and freed Jim in her will. Tom admitted he had intercepted Aunt Polly's letters.

Jim was freed from his chains. Aunt Polly, Uncle Silas, and Aunt Sally, upon learning how Jim had helped the doctor nurse Tom, treated him kindly. Tom gave Jim forty dollars for being a patient prisoner. Jim rejoiced, claiming his hairy breast sign for wealth had come true. Tom then proposed that he, Huck, and Jim go for ""howling adventures amongst the Injuns, over in the territory."" Huck worried he had no money, as Pap would have taken it. Tom revealed that Pap hadn't returned, and Huck's $6,000 was still with Judge Thatcher. Jim then solemnly revealed that the dead man in the floating house that Huck found on Jackson's Island was Pap.

Huck, tired of being ""sivilized"" by Aunt Sally, declared he would ""light out for the territory ahead of the rest."""

**Volume One**

**Chapter 1: Marseilles—The Arrival**
On February 24, 1815, the three-master ship, the _Pharaon_, arrives in Marseilles from Smyrna, Trieste, and Naples. Its owner, M. Morrel, quickly boards the vessel. He is met by Edmond Dantès, the young, active, and vigilant mate, aged eighteen or twenty. Dantès informs M. Morrel of a great misfortune: their brave Captain Leclere died of brain fever off Civita Vecchia. Despite this, the cargo is safe. Dantès explains that Captain Leclere, before dying, instructed him to deliver a packet to Marshal Bertrand on the Island of Elba. During this stop, Dantès even spoke with the Emperor Napoleon, who inquired about the ship and its owner, M. Morrel. M. Morrel is delighted by Dantès's skill and loyalty, and declares his intention to make Dantès the new captain of the _Pharaon_ after consulting his partner.

Danglars, the ship's supercargo, a man of twenty-five or twenty-six, with an unprepossessing countenance and an arrogant attitude towards subordinates, approaches M. Morrel. He expresses dislike for Dantès, criticizing his self-confidence and the stop at Elba, implying it was a whimsical delay. M. Morrel dismisses Danglars's complaints, affirming Dantès's actions were his duty. Dantès asks for some days' leave to visit his father and his betrothed, Mercédès, and then travel to Paris for Captain Leclere's commission. M. Morrel grants the leave, emphasizing that the _Pharaon_ cannot sail without Dantès as her captain, solidifying his promotion. As Dantès leaves, he mentions a past quarrel with Danglars near the island of Monte Cristo. Danglars watches Dantès depart with a look of hate.

**Chapter 2: Father and Son**
Edmond Dantès hurries to his father's small house. His father, frail and joyful, is unaware of his son's arrival. Edmond is dismayed to learn that his father has suffered greatly in his absence, having spent the 200 francs Edmond left him to pay a debt to a neighbor, Caderousse, living on only 60 francs for three months. Edmond empties his pockets, insisting his father buy provisions. Caderousse, a tailor, soon appears, feigning congratulations but casting greedy glances at the money. Edmond offers him some, which Caderousse declines, boasting of his own self-sufficiency. Caderousse hints that Mercédès has many admirers, causing Edmond slight uneasiness. After Edmond leaves to see Mercédès, Caderousse meets Danglars, confirming Edmond's impending captaincy and marriage, and discussing Mercédès's popularity. Danglars expresses his deep hatred and desire to thwart Edmond.

**Chapter 3: The Catalans**
In the village of the Catalans, Mercédès, a beautiful young girl, is with her cousin, Fernand Mondego, who is desperately in love with her. Mercédès, however, repeatedly rejects Fernand, declaring her unwavering love for Edmond Dantès and her intention to marry only him. She cites Fernand's conscription status and her own poverty as reasons against their union. Fernand is consumed by jealousy and expresses a desire for revenge. Edmond arrives, and he and Mercédès embrace passionately. Fernand's gloomy presence is noted by Edmond, but Mercédès insists Fernand is a friend. Fernand, after a forced handshake, rushes out, exclaiming, ""Oh, who will deliver me from this man?"" He joins Danglars and Caderousse at a nearby inn. Caderousse openly discusses Fernand's suffering and Edmond's good fortune. Danglars, seeing Fernand's despair, suggests imprisoning Dantès rather than killing him. He writes an anonymous letter with his left hand, accusing ""Edmond Dantès, mate of the ship _Pharaon_,"" of being a Bonapartist agent carrying letters from Murat to Napoleon, and from Napoleon to a Bonapartist committee in Paris. Danglars crumples the letter, claiming it was a joke, and discards it. Fernand secretly retrieves the letter and heads towards the city. Edmond and Mercédès leave, joyful, announcing their wedding will be held in a day or two at La Réserve.

**Chapter 5: The Marriage Feast**
The wedding feast is prepared at La Réserve. M. Morrel arrives, confirming his intention to make Dantès captain. Edmond and Mercédès enter, radiant with happiness. Mercédès, with innocent kindness, insists Fernand sit next to her, unknowingly torturing him further. Edmond reveals that thanks to M. Morrel, the usual marriage formalities have been waived, and they will be married in an hour and a half at the city hall, before he leaves for Paris. Suddenly, a magistrate and four soldiers arrive and arrest Edmond Dantès in the name of the law. M. Morrel tries to intervene, but the magistrate is firm, stating Dantès is accused of serious political crimes. Old Dantès is devastated. Caderousse, realizing the ""trick,"" confronts Danglars, who denies involvement, claiming he destroyed the incriminating letter. Fernand has disappeared. Edmond, believing it a mistake, assures everyone he will soon be free. As he is led away in a carriage, Mercédès cries out in despair, and Edmond shouts a promise to meet again. M. Morrel leaves to seek information from M. de Villefort. Caderousse, remembering Fernand picking up the letter, suspects his deeper involvement, but Danglars warns him against speaking out, implying he would be seen as an accomplice. Fernand, having returned, now acts as Mercédès's protector, taking her home. Old Dantès is taken home by friends, nearly lifeless. M. Morrel returns with the news: Edmond is charged with being a Bonapartist agent. Danglars, solidifying his own position, is placed in temporary command of the _Pharaon_ by M. Morrel.

**Chapter 6: The Deputy Procureur du Roi**
M. de Villefort celebrates his betrothal to Renée de Saint-Méran, a woman of high social standing and wealth. The guests are staunch Royalists, rejoicing in Napoleon's recent downfall. Villefort, an ambitious man, has distanced himself from his Girondin father, Noirtier, to advance his career as a king's attorney. He is called away by urgent business but returns beaming. He announces the discovery of a Bonapartist conspiracy and reads the anonymous letter denouncing Edmond Dantès. Renée expresses pity for the accused, but Villefort, while appearing to acknowledge her compassion, emphasizes his duty to be severe with conspirators, especially given his family's royalist connections. He reveals his intention to handle the case rigorously.

**Chapter 7: The Examination**
Villefort begins his interrogation of Dantès. Initially, Villefort is favorably impressed by Dantès's intelligence, courage, and frankness. Dantès calmly explains Captain Leclere's dying wish to deliver a packet on the Island of Elba and his brief encounter with Emperor Napoleon. He admits he received a letter from the grand marshal for a M. Noirtier in Paris. Villefort shows Dantès the anonymous denunciation, which Dantès does not recognize, concluding it was written by an envious enemy. Villefort, swayed by Dantès's sincerity and Renée's words, is about to release him. However, when Dantès reveals the letter's recipient is ""Monsieur Noirtier, Rue Coq-Héron, Paris,"" Villefort is utterly shocked. He realizes Noirtier is his own father. To protect his career from being ruined by his father's Bonapartist activities, Villefort, feigning kindness, tells Dantès he must remain detained but promises to destroy the incriminating letter. He burns the letter before Dantès's eyes and makes him swear never to mention the name Noirtier or the letter's contents to anyone. Dantès, believing himself saved, is grateful. Alone, Villefort confirms his decision to sacrifice Dantès to further his own ambition.

**Chapter 8: The Château d’If**
Dantès is transferred from the Marseilles prison. He remains optimistic, believing Villefort's promise of imminent release. He is taken by carriage, then by boat, past familiar landmarks of Marseilles, including La Réserve and the Catalans. To his horror, he realizes he is being taken to the formidable Château d’If, an island fortress used for political prisoners. He attempts to jump overboard but is restrained by gendarmes. He is thrown into a dark, underground dungeon. Overwhelmed by despair and near madness, he laments his missed opportunity to escape into the sea. He repeatedly demands to see the governor, but the jailer refuses, citing prison rules and mentioning a previous prisoner, an abbé, who went mad in that cell. Dantès, desperate, offers the jailer 100 crowns to deliver a message to Mercédès. The jailer refuses, fearing for his job. Dantès, in a fit of rage, threatens the jailer with a stool. As a result, he is moved to an even deeper, darker dungeon, further pushing him towards insanity.

**Chapter 9: The Evening of the Betrothal**
Villefort, after arresting Dantès, returns to his betrothal celebration. He immediately informs the Marquis de Saint-Méran of the grave Bonapartist conspiracy and his urgent need to go to Paris to inform the king. He advises the Marquis to sell his financial assets, hinting at impending political turmoil. Mercédès intercepts Villefort outside his house, desperately inquiring about Edmond. Villefort coldly dismisses Edmond as a dangerous criminal and claims ignorance of his whereabouts. Consumed by remorse, Villefort departs for Paris. Meanwhile, Mercédès returns to the Catalans, sinking into despair, with Fernand attempting to console her. M. Morrel learns of Dantès's arrest and attempts to help him but is met with universal refusal due to the serious Bonapartist accusation. He returns home, hopeless. Caderousse, drunk and remorseful, retreats into his house. Danglars, however, is pleased, having eliminated a rival and secured his position on the _Pharaon_. Fernand, still obsessed with Mercédès, hopes Dantès's absence will lead to their marriage.

**Chapter 10: The King’s Closet at the Tuileries**
In Paris, at the Tuileries Palace, King Louis XVIII is dismissive of M. de Blacas's and M. Dandré's (Minister of Police) concerns about Napoleon on Elba. He jests about Napoleon's boredom and possible insanity. M. de Blacas, however, insists on the seriousness of the threat. Villefort is introduced, having traveled post-haste from Marseilles. He confirms a grave Bonapartist conspiracy and Napoleon's imminent landing, emphasizing his sacrifice in leaving his own betrothal to bring this urgent news. Louis XVIII remains skeptical, believing the monarchy is secure.

**Chapter 11: The Corsican Ogre**
M. Dandré bursts in, pale and trembling, confirming Napoleon has landed in France, near Antibes, on March 1st. Louis XVIII is furious, accusing his ministers of blindness and incompetence. Villefort seizes the opportunity, suggesting immediate action to rally Royalist regions against Napoleon. He then subtly protects M. Dandré, fearing that if Dandré is completely ruined, he might investigate Dantès's arrest, which would expose Villefort. Louis XVIII, impressed by Villefort's apparent foresight, awards him the cross of the Legion of Honor. The king then orders the police to search for a conspirator (described as a dark man of 50-52 with a black moustache), who was involved in the General Quesnel affair. Villefort recognizes this description as his father, Noirtier. He lies, claiming he has not seen his father.

**Chapter 12: Father and Son**
M. Noirtier, Villefort's father, unexpectedly arrives at Villefort's hotel in Paris, having followed his son from Marseilles. Noirtier reveals he is indeed the Bonapartist conspirator and the man involved in General Quesnel's death, which he frames as a political removal, not murder, in a duel. He acknowledges Villefort's act of burning the incriminating letter and sarcastically notes his son's ambition. Noirtier, aware of the police description, quickly shaves his whiskers and changes his clothing to disguise himself. He instructs Villefort to remain silent about their connection and his activities, warning him that his own career is tied to his father's fate. Villefort, agitated, destroys all traces of his father's disguise and leaves for Marseilles, already hearing news of Napoleon's triumphant advance.

**Chapter 13: The Hundred Days**
Noirtier's predictions come true; Napoleon's ""Hundred Days"" are a reality. Villefort's Royalist stance is a liability, but Noirtier's influence in the imperial court protects his son's position. Villefort's marriage is postponed. M. Morrel, now influential as a Bonapartist, repeatedly intercedes for Dantès. Villefort, however, falsely claims Dantès was imprisoned by ""high authority"" under the Bourbons and delays his release, even dictating a petition for Dantès that exaggerates his Bonapartist ties, thus further incriminating him if the Bourbons return. After Waterloo, Louis XVIII is restored. Villefort is promoted and marries Renée. Dantès remains in prison, forgotten. Danglars, fearing Dantès's return, leaves the sea, makes a fortune through speculation, and becomes Baron Danglars. Fernand joins the army, eventually becoming a general and count, amassing wealth through betrayal in Greece. Old Dantès dies of hunger, attended by Mercédès, who subsequently marries Fernand. M. Morrel pays for old Dantès's funeral.

**Chapter 14: The Two Prisoners**
In July 1816, over a year after his imprisonment, Edmond Dantès, now ""number 34,"" is in a state of despair. He makes desperate attempts to communicate with the outside world. An Inspector-General of Prisons visits the Château d’If. Dantès seizes this chance to demand a trial, asserting his innocence and stating he was arrested on February 28, 1815. The Inspector, though somewhat moved, attributes Dantès's state to madness. He then visits ""number 27,"" the Abbé Faria, who is considered utterly insane due to his claims of possessing an immense treasure and offering millions for his release. Dantès, marking the date as July 30, 1816, clings to a flicker of hope after the inspector's visit. A new governor arrives, and Dantès loses his name, becoming merely ""number 34.""

**Chapter 15: Number 34 and Number 27**
Dantès succumbs to profound despair, contemplating suicide by starvation. After four days without food, he suddenly hears a scratching sound from the wall, realizing another prisoner is attempting to escape. He regains his will to live, eats the food his jailer brings (pretending delirium to avoid suspicion), and begins digging a hole in his cell with a broken jug and later the iron handle of his soup saucepan. He successfully breaks through the wall. He hears a voice, which he identifies as the ""mad abbé,"" Faria. Faria reveals his escape tunnel went in the wrong direction and led him to Dantès's cell instead of the sea. Dantès tells Faria his story. The older, wiser Faria is astonished by Dantès's youth and his unjust imprisonment for Bonapartist conspiracy. They agree to collaborate.

**Chapter 16: A Learned Italian**
Dantès enters Faria's cell. Faria, a man of profound intellect, shows Dantès his homemade tools, including a chisel made from his bedstead. He explains his failed escape attempt, caused by a miscalculation, and the reinforced walls of the prison. Faria reveals he is the Abbé Faria, imprisoned for political reasons due to his dream of a unified Italy, which led him to be betrayed by a ""crowned simpleton."" He confesses he was labeled ""mad"" for his claims of a vast treasure. Faria has dedicated his imprisonment to writing and study, making his own pens (from fish bones) and ink (from soot and wine). He has written a voluminous treatise on Italian monarchy. Dantès, humbled by Faria's knowledge, begs to be taught. Faria agrees to educate him in subjects like mathematics, physics, history, and languages. After a year of intense study, Dantès is transformed into a learned man. Faria, now physically weaker, is struck by a paralytic attack (catalepsy), a hereditary illness. He instructs Dantès to administer an elixir to save his life. Dantès successfully revives Faria, who, though partially paralyzed, insists Dantès should escape without him. Dantès, out of deep affection, swears never to leave him. Faria promises to reveal something important the next day.

**Chapter 18: The Treasure**
Faria reveals to Dantès that the half-burnt paper he possesses is the key to his immense treasure. He explains its origin: it is the last will and testament of Cardinal Spada, whose family fortune was sought by Pope Alexander VI and Cesare Borgia. Faria recounts how the Cardinal and his nephew were poisoned, and the treasure secretly hidden on the uninhabited Island of Monte Cristo. Faria discovered the will when a fragment, used as a bookmark, revealed a message in sympathetic ink upon being exposed to fire. The complete will, reconstructed by Faria's tireless research, directs the reader to ""the farthest angle of the second opening"" on Monte Cristo. Faria, embracing Dantès as his son, bestows half the treasure upon him, and the whole if he dies. Dantès, overwhelmed, initially disbelieves, fearing Faria's madness. The governor visits, finding Faria apparently well. Faria, now partially paralyzed, is determined for Dantès to have the treasure.

**Chapter 19: The Third Attack**
The escape tunnel they had painstakingly dug is discovered and sealed off, crushing their hopes. Dantès, though disappointed, reassures Faria that Faria's wisdom is his true treasure. Faria, still paralyzed, focuses on teaching Dantès the exact location of the treasure on Monte Cristo. He makes Dantès memorize the will and then destroys the second part, ensuring its secrecy. One night, Faria suffers his third and fatal catalepsy attack. With his last breaths, he urges Dantès to remember ""Monte Cristo!"" Dantès administers the elixir, but Faria dies. Dantès is consumed by grief but resolves to use Faria's body to escape. He overhears the jailers planning to sew Faria's body into a sack and throw it into the sea, as the Château d’If has no cemetery.

**Chapter 20: The Cemetery of the Château d’If**
Dantès, now free from doubt and filled with a renewed will to live and enact vengeance, decides to take Faria's place in the burial sack. He moves Faria's corpse to his own cell, covering it in his bed, then enters Faria's empty cell, gets into the sack, and sews it up from the inside with the knife Faria made. He waits in terrifying darkness. Two grave-diggers arrive, comment on the body's weight, and tie a 36-pound cannonball to his feet. They carry him to the edge of the rock and throw him into the sea. Dantès screams as he plunges into the icy water.

**Chapter 21: The Island of Tiboulen**
Underwater, Dantès uses Faria's knife to cut through the sack and sever the cord attaching the cannonball. He surfaces far from the Château d’If, seeing the fortress's alarm gun (a torch) lit. He swims towards the uninhabited islands of Tiboulen or Lemaire, guided by the Planier lighthouse. During a storm, he reaches Tiboulen. He finds shelter and drinks rainwater. He sees a fishing boat, the _Jeune Amélie_, wrecked nearby. Inspired, he takes a red cap and timber from the wreckage and, pretending to be a shipwrecked sailor, signals the passing _Jeune Amélie_, which rescues him. He speaks bad Italian and claims to be a Maltese sailor. The sailor Jacopo notes his long hair and beard. Dantès invents a story of a vow and the shipwreck. The captain, Gaetano, impressed by his seamanship, offers him a temporary position. A distant cannon shot from the Château d’If is heard, signaling an escape. Dantès calmly identifies it as an alarm for a prisoner. Jacopo reveals the date: February 28, 1829. Dantès realizes he has been imprisoned for fourteen years and renews his oath of vengeance against Danglars, Fernand, and Villefort.

**Chapter 22: The Smugglers**
Dantès, now disguised, quickly learns that the _Jeune Amélie_ is a smuggling vessel. He maintains his fabricated identity. In Leghorn, he cuts his long hair and beard, observing his transformed, stern, and intelligent appearance in a mirror. He buys new clothes, completing his disguise. The captain offers him a permanent position, but Dantès agrees only to a three-month engagement. The ship loads contraband. During a confrontation with customs officers, Dantès is wounded, but conceals his pain, demonstrating his newfound indifference to physical suffering. Jacopo's genuine concern touches him. Dantès, using charts, teaches navigation to Jacopo. The captain proposes a lucrative smuggling operation on Monte Cristo Island. Dantès, feigning indifference, readily agrees, planning to use this opportunity to find his treasure.

**Chapter 23: The Island of Monte Cristo**
On the night before reaching Monte Cristo, Dantès is restless, dreaming of the treasure. The next day, he steers the ship, feigning exhaustion. They anchor at Monte Cristo. Dantès, eager to search for the treasure, pretends to go hunting for wild goats and sends Jacopo back to the ship with a killed kid. Alone, he follows the cryptic marks on the rocks, which lead to a large circular stone. Realizing the stone was lowered, not lifted, he uses gunpowder to blast it open, revealing an iron ring set in a flagstone. He lifts the flagstone, discovering steps descending into a dark grotto. Initially fearful and doubting, he then remembers Faria’s words about the ""second opening"" and descends. He finds a second grotto, and using his pickaxe, discovers an oaken coffer with the Spada family crest. He breaks it open and is dazzled by compartments filled with gold coins, gold bars, diamonds, pearls, and rubies. He spends the night overcome with awe and disbelief, guarding his immense fortune.

**Chapter 25: The Unknown**
The morning after discovering the treasure, Dantès meticulously re-hides it in the grotto, disguising any trace of his activity. Six days later, the smugglers return. Dantès feigns continued injury from his ""accident"" to explain his prolonged stay. He learns the smugglers narrowly escaped a guard-ship. In Leghorn, Dantès sells four small diamonds for 5,000 francs each, allaying any suspicion by pretending to be a wealthy eccentric. He buys Jacopo a new fishing vessel and gives him 100 piastres, sending him to Marseilles to inquire about his father, Louis Dantès, and Mercédès, and to return to Monte Cristo. Dantès then buys a luxurious yacht in Genoa for 60,000 francs (paid with diamonds), commissioning a secret locker inside. He sails the yacht to Monte Cristo and transfers his treasure. Jacopo returns with devastating news: Dantès's father is dead, and Mercédès has disappeared. Dantès, though outwardly calm, is deeply affected. He sails his yacht to Marseilles, using an English passport under the name ""Lord Wilmore."" He tests his unrecognizable appearance by speaking to an old _Pharaon_ sailor, who does not know him. He then buys his old house in the Allées de Meilhan for an exorbitant sum and provides free housing for the current tenants. After inquiring about Mercédès and Caderousse (now gone), he leaves Marseilles.

**Volume Two**

**Chapter 26: The Pont du Gard Inn**
Caderousse, now the impoverished innkeeper of the ""Pont du Gard"" between Beaucaire and Bellegarde, struggles financially. His wife, Madeleine (La Carconte), is sickly and complains constantly. An Italian priest, the Abbé Busoni (Monte Cristo in disguise), arrives, asking for Caderousse by name. Caderousse, surprised, confirms his identity and his former profession as a tailor in Marseilles. The Abbé orders wine and asks if Caderousse is alone.

**Chapter 27: The Story**
The Abbé Busoni (Monte Cristo) asks Caderousse about Edmond Dantès. Caderousse, after initial hesitation, tearfully recounts Edmond's fate: he died a miserable prisoner. He also reveals that Edmond's father died of ""downright starvation."" The Abbé then reveals that Edmond, before his death, bequeathed a magnificent diamond (worth 50,000 francs) to his four friends (Caderousse, Danglars, Fernand, Mercédès) and his father, with the father's share to be divided among the survivors. La Carconte, overhearing, is drawn into the conversation. Caderousse confesses, reluctantly, that Danglars wrote the anonymous denunciation letter, and Fernand posted it. He claims he was drunk and thought it was a harmless joke. The Abbé also learns that M. Morrel is now ruined, while Danglars has become a wealthy baron and Fernand a celebrated general, who acquired his fortune through the betrayal of Ali Pasha in Greece. The Abbé gives the diamond to Caderousse as his and old Dantès's share. Caderousse and La Carconte, overcome with greed, plan to sell the diamond. Caderousse leaves for Beaucaire to have the diamond appraised. The Abbé (Monte Cristo) leaves, having uncovered the full extent of the past betrayals and their consequences.

**Chapter 28: The Prison Register**
Monte Cristo, disguised as an ""Englishman"" named Thomson & French, a Roman banker, visits the Mayor of Marseilles to inquire about M. Morrel's financial state. The Mayor, a creditor himself, directs him to M. de Boville, the Inspector of Prisons, another major creditor. Monte Cristo offers to buy Boville's 200,000-franc debt for its full value, in cash. As a ""commission,"" he asks to see the prison registers. Boville, delighted, recounts how the ""mad abbé"" Faria claimed to have a treasure. He then tells the story of Edmond Dantès, a ""dangerous Bonapartist,"" who, after Faria's death, escaped by taking Faria's place in the burial sack and was thrown into the sea with a cannonball, presumed drowned. Monte Cristo, maintaining his composure, obtains Dantès's mortuary deposition and the original denunciation letter (which was kept in the prison records). He discovers Villefort's marginal notes on Morrel's petition, which had further sealed Dantès's fate by exaggerating his Bonapartist ties. Monte Cristo pays Boville and leaves, now fully aware of the extent of the conspiracy against him.

**Chapter 29: The House of Morrel & Son**
M. Morrel's shipping business is in a state of ruin, with lost ships and no credit. His last hope, the _Pharaon_, is overdue. Emmanuel, his future son-in-law, and Julie, his daughter, are distraught. Cocles, the cashier, remains steadfast, unable to believe the house could fail. The ""Englishman"" (Monte Cristo) arrives, presenting bills totaling 287,500 francs, including M. de Boville's debt. Morrel, in despair, confesses he cannot pay. News then arrives that the _Pharaon_ has been lost, but its crew, including Penelon, is saved. Morrel is grateful for the lives saved. The Englishman grants Morrel a three-month extension to pay his debts. He gives Julie a mysterious instruction: to obey a future letter signed ""Sinbad the Sailor"" implicitly. He leaves, taking Penelon aside for a private conversation.

**Chapter 30: The Fifth of September**
Morrel's temporary reprieve gives him a glimmer of hope, but his resources are exhausted. He travels to Paris to seek help from Danglars, who is now immensely wealthy, but is coldly refused. Returning home, Morrel, determined to die honorably rather than face bankruptcy, prepares to commit suicide. His son, Maximilian, a captain in the Spahis, arrives, having been summoned by his mother and sister. Maximilian confronts his father, who reveals his suicidal intent. Maximilian, in turn, offers to die with him. Morrel convinces Maximilian to live for his family's honor. At the last moment, as Morrel is about to shoot himself, Julie rushes in. She presents him with a red silk purse containing a receipt for all his debts (287,500 francs) and a large diamond, with a note: ""Julie's Dowry. Sinbad the Sailor."" Simultaneously, Emmanuel announces the miraculous arrival of a new ship, also named the _Pharaon_, fully laden and with Captain Gaumard and Penelon on board. Morrel is overwhelmed with joy, believing it a divine intervention. Monte Cristo, observing the scene from a distance, murmurs that his vengeance is now complete for the good, and he will now focus on punishing the wicked. He then hails Jacopo and departs in his yacht.

**Chapter 31: Italy: Sinbad the Sailor**
In Florence in 1838, Albert de Morcerf and Franz d’Épinay plan to attend the Carnival in Rome. Franz, after visiting Elba, decides to explore the uninhabited Island of Monte Cristo. His boat's captain, Gaetano, warns him the island is a refuge for smugglers and pirates, and landing there would require a six-day quarantine. Franz accepts. Gaetano recounts how pirates dispose of victims. Approaching Monte Cristo at night, Franz sees a fire and learns it's occupied by Spanish smugglers and Corsican bandits. He's invited to sup with their chief, ""Sinbad the Sailor,"" on condition of being blindfolded. Franz is led into a magnificent subterranean cave, where he meets his host, a man of 38-40, dressed in Tunisian costume. Sinbad recounts how he saved his mute Nubian servant, Ali, from execution. He speaks of his life of absolute freedom and dispensing his own justice. Sinbad offers Franz hashish, claiming it provides profound pleasures and insights. Franz takes it and experiences vivid, voluptuous dreams.

**Chapter 32: The Waking**
Franz awakes in a grotto, feeling refreshed. The hashish dream dissipates. The sailors inform him ""Signor Sinbad"" has departed for Malaga. Franz sees Sinbad's yacht sailing away. He unsuccessfully attempts to find the enchanted grotto again. He leaves Monte Cristo, heading for Rome. There, he meets Albert. They struggle to find a carriage for Carnival, as all are booked. Signor Pastrini, their innkeeper, informs them that the Count of Monte Cristo, residing on the same floor, has offered them seats in his carriage and windows at the Palazzo Rospoli. Franz, recalling his Monte Cristo adventure, suspects this count is ""Sinbad the Sailor.""

**Chapter 33: Roman Bandits**
Franz reads a public notice of executions: Andrea Rondolo and Peppino (an accomplice of Luigi Vampa) are to be executed. He realizes this matches the conversation he overheard at the Colosseum, confirming Monte Cristo's connection to bandits. Albert and Franz visit Monte Cristo, who is calm and cultured. Monte Cristo discusses his philosophy of justice and vengeance, implying he has experienced profound suffering. He casually mentions a pardon for Peppino. Franz, witnessing the Carnival festivities, sees the Rospoli Palace windows display the agreed-upon signal (white damask with a red cross), confirming Peppino's pardon. Albert, meanwhile, flirts with a mysterious ""Roman peasant"" who throws him violets, leading to a rendezvous. On the last day of Carnival, Albert attends the rendezvous but is ambushed by Luigi Vampa's bandits, led by ""Beppo"" (a boy disguised as a peasant girl). Albert is taken to the Catacombs of St. Sebastian. He sends a ransom note for 4,000 piastres to Franz, signed by Luigi Vampa. Franz, realizing the danger, goes to Monte Cristo for help. Monte Cristo, with Ali and Peppino, rescues Albert from the catacombs, confronting Vampa and reminding him of his ""friends."" Albert is freed, returning to a ball, unaware of how close he came to death.

**Chapter 38: The Rendezvous**
Albert de Morcerf, grateful for his rescue, visits Monte Cristo to thank him and offers his family's influence in Parisian society. Monte Cristo, feigning to be a stranger to Paris, accepts Albert's offer to introduce him. They agree to meet at Albert's home (No. 27, Rue du Helder) on May 21st at 10:30 AM. Franz, uneasy about Monte Cristo's enigmatic nature and the cold touch of his hand, recounts his experiences with Monte Cristo, but Albert dismisses his fears as imagination.

**Chapter 39: The Guests**
Albert prepares his pavilion for Monte Cristo's arrival. His friends, including Debray, Beauchamp, Château-Renaud, and Maximilian Morrel, gather for breakfast. They discuss society, politics, and Danglars's recent financial gains. Albert recounts his capture by bandits and rescue by Monte Cristo, referring to him as ""Sinbad the Sailor"" and hinting at his hidden wealth. Maximilian Morrel, upon hearing this, hints at his own past connection to a ""Sinbad."" Monte Cristo arrives, punctually, and Albert introduces him to his friends. Monte Cristo displays his extensive knowledge, admits to using opium and hashish, and speaks of exchanging emeralds for human lives (Peppino's pardon and the Sultan's slave). He mentions his Corsican steward, Bertuccio, has a mysterious past involving a ""stab with a knife."" Monte Cristo reveals he has credit with Thomson & French, causing Maximilian Morrel to react strongly. Monte Cristo invites everyone to a dinner at his Auteuil country house, but subtly excludes the Morcerfs, claiming he has an engagement with Major Cavalcanti and his son.

**Chapter 40: The Breakfast**
During breakfast, Albert and his friends continue to discuss Monte Cristo. Monte Cristo's past actions (the emeralds, the pardons) are brought up, and Albert notes his ""egotism."" Albert, concerned about his unwanted marriage to Eugénie Danglars and his mother's disapproval, seeks advice from Monte Cristo. Monte Cristo suggests inviting the Danglars and Villeforts to his Auteuil house, but to exclude the Morcerfs to avoid a ""matrimonial meeting,"" which would displease Albert's mother. Albert accepts, deciding to go to Tréport with his mother. Monte Cristo confirms his invitation to the Cavalcantis.

**Chapter 41: The Presentation**
Albert gives Monte Cristo a tour of his luxurious pavilion. Monte Cristo is particularly drawn to a portrait of Mercédès in Catalan costume, painted years ago. Albert reveals it is his mother, painted during his father's absence, and that his father dislikes it. He mentions his mother cries when looking at it. Albert then introduces Monte Cristo to his parents, the Count and Countess of Morcerf (Fernand and Mercédès). Monte Cristo observes Fernand's careworn face and Mercédès's paleness and silence. Monte Cristo compliments Fernand's military career. Mercédès, deeply moved, thanks Monte Cristo for saving Albert's life. Monte Cristo is equally pale. After he leaves, Mercédès questions Albert about the count, expressing deep unease and calling him a ""problem"" and an ""enigma."" Albert dismisses her fears.

**Chapter 42: Monsieur Bertuccio**
Monte Cristo's Parisian mansion in the Champs-Élysées is sumptuously furnished. He orders Bertuccio to purchase a seaside estate in Normandy for his corvette, registered in Bertuccio's name. Monte Cristo then buys a house in Auteuil, Rue de la Fontaine, No. 28, which had belonged to M. de Saint-Méran (Villefort's father-in-law). Bertuccio is visibly agitated upon hearing the address. Monte Cristo insists Bertuccio accompany him to Auteuil. Bertuccio makes the sign of the cross and mutters a prayer, clearly terrified.

**Chapter 43: The House at Auteuil**
Monte Cristo and Bertuccio arrive at the house in Auteuil. The concierge confirms the previous owner was M. de Saint-Méran and that his daughter married M. de Villefort. Bertuccio's agitation increases. Monte Cristo forces Bertuccio to lead the way down a private staircase to the garden. Bertuccio, overcome, refuses to go further, exclaiming that ""the evil has arrived!"" and that this house is the scene of an ""assassination."" Monte Cristo demands an explanation. Bertuccio, trembling, reveals he declared a vendetta against M. de Villefort after Villefort, as a procureur, refused to investigate the murder of Bertuccio's brother (a Bonapartist).

**Chapter 44: The Vendetta**
Bertuccio confesses to Monte Cristo the full story of his vendetta against Villefort. He explains that in 1815, his brother, a Bonapartist soldier, was murdered in Nîmes during Royalist massacres. Villefort, then a procureur, dismissed Bertuccio's plea for justice with cruel indifference, justifying his brother's death politically. Bertuccio swore vengeance. He tracked Villefort to the Auteuil house, where he observed Villefort having a secret affair with a pregnant woman. One night, he saw Villefort bury a box in the garden. Believing it contained treasure, Bertuccio stabbed Villefort, took the box, and found a newborn infant inside, still alive. He left the child at a foundling asylum, keeping half of a napkin with the initials ""H.N."" (Hermine de Nargonne, Madame Danglars' maiden name) and a baron's coronet. Monte Cristo (as Abbé Busoni) later visited Bertuccio in prison, where Bertuccio had been wrongly accused of the murder of a jeweller (Joannes). Bertuccio made a full confession to Busoni, who then helped clear his name by arranging for the arrest of the actual culprit, Caderousse. Bertuccio, released, became Monte Cristo's steward. Bertuccio expresses remorse for abandoning the infant and is terrified to revisit the scene of his crime, fearing the house. Monte Cristo, having extracted the full story, implies that Villefort may not be dead and that the child (Benedetto) will be an instrument of divine retribution.

**Chapter 45: The Rain of Blood**
(This chapter contains the story Caderousse told to Monte Cristo, disguised as Abbé Busoni, about the murder of Joannes, and how Bertuccio was wrongly imprisoned for it.) Caderousse confessed that he and his wife, La Carconte, murdered the jeweller Joannes after selling him the diamond Monte Cristo (as Abbé Busoni) had given Caderousse. They lured Joannes to stay overnight at their inn. Caderousse attacked him, and La Carconte assisted. Bertuccio, hidden in a shed, witnessed the crime. When Bertuccio tried to help the dying Joannes, he was found by gendarmes and mistakenly arrested due to his blood-stained clothes (from stabbing Villefort previously). Bertuccio was imprisoned and accused. The Abbé Busoni (Monte Cristo) visited him, heard his confession about both the Auteuil crime and the Joannes murder, and then arranged for Caderousse to be apprehended. Caderousse was eventually sentenced to the galleys for life, and Bertuccio was released and subsequently hired by Monte Cristo.

**Chapter 46: Unlimited Credit**
Baron Danglars attempts to visit Monte Cristo but is denied entry. Monte Cristo, observing Danglars through a lorgnette, notes his unpleasant features. He instructs Bertuccio to buy Danglars's dappled gray horses at any price. Monte Cristo then speaks to his valet, Baptistin, emphasizing obedience and warning of severe consequences for disloyalty. He also asserts his absolute power over his slave, Ali. Monte Cristo, having acquired Danglars's prize horses, visits Danglars, who boasts of his wealth but is unsettled by Monte Cristo's questions. Monte Cristo subtly challenges Danglars's financial stability, revealing his own immense fortune through multiple letters of unlimited credit from European bankers. He demands 500,000 francs in gold and notes the next day, stating he is ""much in want of money."" Danglars, overwhelmed, complies. Monte Cristo then meets Madame Danglars and Lucien Debray, subtly hinting at his knowledge of Madame Danglars's affair with Debray.

**Chapter 47: The Dappled Grays**
At Madame Danglars's boudoir, Danglars introduces Monte Cristo, boasting of the count's plan to spend six million francs in Paris. Madame Danglars is shocked to learn her prized dappled grey horses are missing. Danglars, feigning concern, claims he sold them for her safety. Monte Cristo then reveals he purchased the horses for 30,000 francs and is returning them, adorned with diamonds, as he cannot bear to cause a ""lovely woman's regrets."" Danglars is furious, having only gained 16,000 francs from the sale and his wife being further humiliated. Monte Cristo then orchestrates an ""accident"" at his Auteuil home, where Madame de Villefort and her son Edward are in the returned dappled grey carriage when the horses bolt. Ali, Monte Cristo's Nubian slave, heroically stops the runaway horses, saving them. Monte Cristo takes them into his home, revives Edward with an elixir, and learns Madame de Villefort's identity. He notes Edward's rude behavior. Madame de Villefort, deeply impressed, praises Monte Cristo and writes to Madame Danglars about the incident, requesting an introduction to the count. Villefort resolves to visit Monte Cristo.

**Volume Three**

**Chapter 48: Ideology**
M. de Villefort, the King's Attorney, a man of rigid principles and cold ambition, visits Monte Cristo to thank him for saving his wife and son. Villefort, suspicious, is met with Monte Cristo's equally cold demeanor. Their conversation delves into philosophy, justice, and crime. Monte Cristo asserts himself as a ""cosmopolite"" and an ""agent of Providence"" with boundless power and knowledge. He claims to have mastered time and distance, and to fear only death and madness. Villefort, attempting to challenge Monte Cristo's pride, invites him to his house to witness his father, Noirtier, rendered immobile by apoplexy, as a spectacle of human frailty. Monte Cristo accepts the invitation.

**Chapter 49: Haydée**
Monte Cristo visits Haydée, who lives in opulent Oriental apartments within his Parisian mansion. Haydée expresses profound love and devotion, calling him her master and father, and reveals she never truly remembered her birth father, Ali Tepelini, as she only knew Monte Cristo. Monte Cristo assures her of her freedom in France but instructs her to guard the secret of her birth and her parents' names. Haydée agrees. Monte Cristo, touched by her love, feels a renewed sense of happiness and questions his path of vengeance.

**Chapter 50: The Morrel Family**
Monte Cristo visits Maximilian Morrel, Julie, and Emmanuel at their modest home in the Rue Meslay. Maximilian and Julie welcome him warmly, recounting their happiness despite their limited means. Maximilian explains how Emmanuel, out of honor, dissolved their shipping business after their father's ruin, leaving them with a respectable but small income. Monte Cristo observes the red silk purse under a crystal globe, a treasured relic. Maximilian tearfully reveals it was a gift from their ""unknown benefactor"" who saved their father, M. Morrel, from suicide and financial ruin. He then shares his father's dying words: ""It was Edmond Dantès!"" Monte Cristo is deeply moved and turns pale, realizing the profound impact of his past act of benevolence on the Morrel family. He abruptly leaves, visibly shaken.

**Chapter 51: Pyramus and Thisbe**
Maximilian, now disguised as a gardener, cultivates a patch of lucerne adjacent to the Villefort garden, allowing him to secretly meet Valentine. Valentine, unhappy about her forced engagement to Franz d’Épinay, confesses her love for Maximilian. She reveals her stepmother, Madame de Villefort, desires her fortune, which would pass to her own son, Edward, if Valentine were to die or enter a convent. Valentine explains her grandfather, Noirtier, opposes her marriage and is her sole protector. Maximilian, deeply in love, proposes eloping, but Valentine, fearing her father's wrath and her duty to her dying grandmother, hesitates. She recounts a conversation where her father and Danglars spoke ill of Maximilian's family, and Noirtier, with his eyes, showed his approval of Maximilian. Maximilian reveals he met Monte Cristo, who deliberately lost a game of cards to him so he could buy his cherished horse, Médéah. Valentine is called away by a maid, announcing the Count of Monte Cristo's visit. Maximilian wonders about Monte Cristo's connection to Villefort.

**Chapter 52: Toxicology**
Monte Cristo visits Madame de Villefort. Edward, mischievous, behaves rudely. Monte Cristo subtly brings up a past encounter with Madame de Villefort and Valentine in Perugia, where they discussed the poison _aqua Tofana_. Madame de Villefort is uneasy, feigning no memory. Edward confirms catching a peacock, linking to the Perugia memory. Monte Cristo, a skilled chemist, explains the method of gradually accustoming oneself to poisons (like Mithridates) to build immunity, and how poisons can be disguised to mimic natural deaths. Madame de Villefort shows keen interest in these details, mentioning her own ""laboratory."" Monte Cristo, observing Edward's crafty look, subtly warns Madame de Villefort against Edward. He offers her a phial of red liquid, an anti-spasmodic, but warns that a larger dose is deadly poison. Monte Cristo leaves, satisfied that he has planted a dangerous seed in Madame de Villefort's mind.

**Chapter 53: Robert le Diable**
Albert, Beauchamp, and Château-Renaud attend the opera. They discuss Albert's lack of enthusiasm for his arranged marriage to Eugénie Danglars, noting her ""masculine"" beauty. Beauchamp reveals a horse named ""Vampa"" won a race, linking to Monte Cristo. Madame Danglars, Eugénie, and Debray arrive. Albert and Château-Renaud visit Countess G—, who expresses her terror of Monte Cristo, describing him as a ""vampire."" Monte Cristo and Haydée appear, drawing all attention. Albert, intrigued by Haydée, asks to be introduced. Monte Cristo agrees, with two conditions: Albert must not mention the meeting to anyone, nor mention his father's service to Ali Pasha. Haydée, speaking Italian, is polite but cold to Albert. When Albert inadvertently mentions his father served Ali Pasha, Haydée reacts with furious anger, revealing that Fernand Mondego (Albert's father) betrayed her father, Ali Tepelini, selling him and his family to the Turks for money. Haydée, overcome with emotion, leaves the box, unable to bear being near Albert.

**Chapter 54: A Flurry in Stocks**
Albert and Debray visit Monte Cristo. Albert still expresses his aversion to marrying Eugénie Danglars, citing his mother's disapproval. Debray reveals that Madame Danglars speculates on the Bourse using inside information from him, and that Danglars recently made 300,000 livres on Haiti bonds thanks to a tip. Albert jokingly suggests Debray could manipulate the market to ""reform"" Madame Danglars. Monte Cristo proposes a dinner at his Auteuil country house, inviting the Danglars and Villefort families, but pointedly excludes Albert and his parents to avoid a ""matrimonial meeting"" and to spare Mercédès. Albert agrees, deciding to go to Tréport with his mother instead. Monte Cristo, having secured Danglars's attendance, plans to invite Major Bartolomeo Cavalcanti and his son Andrea. Monte Cristo subtly advises Danglars to write to Yanina to investigate Fernand Mondego's past.

**Chapter 55: Major Cavalcanti**
Major Bartolomeo Cavalcanti, a pompous Italian, arrives at Monte Cristo's house, believing Monte Cristo is ""Abbé Busoni's"" friend. Monte Cristo, playing the role, claims to know the Major is a wealthy patrician seeking his long-lost son. He shows the Major a letter from ""Abbé Busoni"" confirming his identity and a fabricated fortune. The letter also mentions a credit of 48,000 francs for the Major from Monte Cristo. Monte Cristo gives the Major 8,000 francs cash and provides him with falsified marriage and baptismal certificates for himself and his ""son,"" Andrea, to establish their identity and claim their fortune. He advises the Major to act discreetly and to avoid revealing the ""lost son"" story.

**Chapter 56: Andrea Cavalcanti**
Andrea Cavalcanti (Benedetto), the ""lost son,"" arrives and is introduced to Monte Cristo. Andrea, playing his part, concocts a story of being abducted in infancy and receiving a good education. Monte Cristo informs him his ""father"" (Major Cavalcanti) is present. Andrea feigns surprise and joy, then embraces the Major. Monte Cristo, observing through a secret panel, sees Andrea mock the Major, subtly revealing his knowledge that their relationship is a charade. Andrea, in turn, reveals he received a letter from ""Lord Wilmore"" (Monte Cristo) detailing his false identity and promised annual income of 50,000 livres. They both agree to play their roles. Monte Cristo gives Andrea 8,000 francs as initial expenses and invites both Cavalcantis to his Auteuil dinner, where Danglars, Andrea's banker, will be present.

**Chapter 57: In the Lucern Patch**
Maximilian, disguised as a gardener, meets Valentine at the gate of the Villefort garden. Valentine, still distraught over her impending marriage to Franz d’Épinay, confesses her love for Maximilian. She reveals her stepmother, Madame de Villefort, schemes to inherit her fortune for Edward by pushing her into a convent or through other means. Valentine states that her grandfather, Noirtier, also opposes her marriage and is her only true ally. Maximilian suggests eloping, but Valentine hesitates due to her loyalty to Noirtier and fear of her father. She agrees to delay the marriage if possible. Maximilian recounts how Monte Cristo manipulated a card game to allow him to buy his horse, suggesting the Count's powerful, almost supernatural, influence. Valentine is called away, as Monte Cristo is visiting the Villeforts.

**Chapter 58: M. Noirtier de Villefort**
M. de Villefort and Madame de Villefort visit Noirtier, who communicates through eye movements. They inform Noirtier of Valentine's impending marriage to Franz d’Épinay. Noirtier displays intense anger, vehemently opposing the union. Villefort implies that Noirtier's past Bonapartist actions and animosity towards Franz's father (General d'Épinay, whom Noirtier killed in a duel) are the cause of his displeasure. Madame de Villefort, in contrast, feigns concern for Valentine, subtly suggesting that if Valentine were to die or enter a convent, her fortune would pass to Edward. Noirtier clearly rejects this notion. He demands to see a notary. Villefort, surprised and irritated, but unable to refuse his father, agrees to send for one.

**Chapter 59: The Will**
A notary arrives at Villefort's house. Valentine, proficient in interpreting Noirtier's eye language, acts as his interpreter. Noirtier confirms his desire to make a will. To everyone's astonishment, he disinherits Valentine, stating this is due to her impending marriage to Franz. He also explicitly refuses to leave his fortune to Edward or Villefort, declaring it will go to charity. Villefort is furious, but Noirtier's will and sanity are attested by his clear communication. Villefort, determined to proceed with Valentine's marriage despite the financial loss, leaves with his wife. The will is formally signed, leaving Noirtier's 900,000 francs to charity if Valentine marries Franz.

**Chapter 60: The Telegraph**
Monte Cristo visits Villefort after the will signing. Villefort, agitated, tells Monte Cristo about his father's ""capricious"" decision to disinherit Valentine, causing a loss of 900,000 francs. Madame de Villefort suggests Valentine might be conspiring with Noirtier. Villefort, asserting his authority, declares he will proceed with the marriage to Franz. Monte Cristo subtly questions Villefort about Noirtier's political past and General d’Épinay's death, noting their connection. He implies he knows the true circumstances of General d’Épinay’s death. Villefort, visibly shaken, tries to deflect. Monte Cristo reveals he purchased the Auteuil house (where Bertuccio claims to have stabbed Villefort and buried the infant). Monte Cristo then leaves, stating he is going to visit a telegraph station, expressing his fascination with how simple operators can transmit complex messages, hinting at his own manipulation of communication. Monte Cristo's words are a clear message to Villefort, who leaves to inform his wife about the house.

**Chapter 61: How a Gardener May Get Rid of the Dormice that Eat His Peaches**
Monte Cristo visits a telegraph tower in Montlhéry. He encounters the telegraph operator, a simple man more interested in his small garden than his work. The operator complains about dormice. Monte Cristo, feigning interest, offers the operator 25,000 francs (fifteen years' wages) to alter a telegraph message. The operator, overwhelmed by the sum, agrees and transmits a false message. This false message causes Danglars to lose 500,000 francs by selling his Spanish bonds. When the truth is revealed the next day (that Don Carlos had not fled), the funds rise, causing Danglars to lose a total of one million francs. Monte Cristo later tells Morrel he discovered ""how a gardener may get rid of the dormice that eat his peaches,"" a veiled reference to his manipulation of the telegraph operator to ruin Danglars.

**Chapter 62: Ghosts**
Monte Cristo's house at Auteuil is transformed into a luxurious residence by Bertuccio, but the garden is left untouched. At a dinner party hosted by Monte Cristo, the guests include M. and Madame de Villefort, Danglars, Madame Danglars, Debray, Château-Renaud, Morrel, and the Cavalcantis. Monte Cristo subtly draws attention to the Auteuil house's history, describing it as once gloomy and perhaps the scene of a crime. He leads the guests to a ""dramatic"" red damask room. There, he recounts how he had the garden dug up and discovered the skeleton of a newborn infant. Madame Danglars is horrified, while Villefort is visibly terrified. Monte Cristo implies that the ""competent authorities"" (Villefort himself) should investigate this crime, knowing this directly implicates both Villefort and Madame Danglars. Villefort and Madame Danglars exchange a desperate look and arrange a private meeting for the next day.

**Chapter 63: The Dinner**
(This chapter is chronologically part of Chapter 62, detailing events during the same dinner.) The magnificent dinner continues. Monte Cristo observes his guests, particularly Villefort and Madame Danglars. He shows off exotic foods, reinforcing his image as a man capable of obtaining the impossible. He explicitly mentions the Auteuil house belonged to M. de Saint-Méran. He then leads the guests to the red damask room, continuing his unsettling narrative about a potential crime within its walls. He reveals the discovery of an infant's skeleton in the garden, directly confronting Villefort and Madame Danglars with their past. Madame Danglars nearly faints, and Villefort is visibly shaken. Monte Cristo, seeing their distress, ends the tour and suggests coffee in the garden. Villefort and Madame Danglars agree to meet privately.

**Chapter 64: The Beggar**
After Monte Cristo's dinner at Auteuil, the guests depart. Danglars, impressed by Major Cavalcanti, offers him a ride. Andrea Cavalcanti, flaunting his new identity, is approached by a disguised Caderousse (now a beggar). Caderousse addresses Andrea as ""Master Benedetto"" and blackmails him, demanding a ride and a monthly allowance, threatening to expose his past as a galley-slave. Andrea, recognizing Caderousse, is forced to comply, sending his groom away. Once alone, Caderousse reveals he knows Andrea's true identity and past, and that Monte Cristo is Andrea's real father. Andrea, terrified of exposure, agrees to pay Caderousse 200 francs monthly. Caderousse then takes Andrea's greatcoat and hat, disguising himself as Andrea's servant, and rides into Paris in the tilbury. Andrea is left humiliated.

**Chapter 65: A Conjugal Scene**
Lucien Debray visits Madame Danglars. She is distressed by the scandal surrounding Andrea's arrest and her daughter's broken engagement. Danglars, surprisingly calm, confronts his wife. He reveals he knows about her secret speculations on the Bourse, based on inside information from Debray. He details her past gains and his recent loss of 700,000 francs (part of the telegraph fraud), demanding she repay him 175,000 francs. He also cruelly exposes his knowledge of her past affair with Villefort and the illegitimate child she bore, whose first husband, M. de Nargonne, died of grief after discovering her pregnancy. Danglars, asserting his power, declares he has always known of her indiscretions and will not tolerate being ruined. Madame Danglars, shattered by these revelations, faints. Danglars leaves her, unmoved.

**Chapter 66: Matrimonial Projects**
Danglars, reviewing his financial situation, is pleased by Andrea Cavalcanti's supposed fortune and proceeds with the marriage plans. Andrea boasts of his ""inheritance."" Monte Cristo visits Danglars, who feigns sympathy for his financial losses and Eugénie's flight. Monte Cristo, however, subtly warns Danglars against trusting Cavalcanti, hinting at the buried wealth of ancient Italian families being inherited in peculiar ways. He also mentions he has credit with Thomson & French. Danglars, eager to discredit Albert, asks Monte Cristo for information about Fernand Mondego's past in Yanina. Monte Cristo confirms Fernand's original name and connection to Ali Pasha, and advises Danglars to write to Yanina for details. Albert arrives, but Danglars dismisses him, insinuating Eugénie prefers Cavalcanti. Danglars then receives a courier from Greece. He takes Monte Cristo aside, confirming ""a whole history connected with the names Fernand and Yanina."" Danglars, delighted, immediately plans to write to his correspondents in Greece.

**Chapter 67: The Office of the King’s Attorney**
Madame Danglars visits Villefort, heavily veiled. The atmosphere in Villefort's house is somber and suspicious due to the recent deaths. Villefort, grief-stricken, admits his own suffering. Madame Danglars complains about the scandal of Andrea's arrest. Villefort reveals the terrible truth: the infant he buried in the Auteuil garden was *not* there when he returned to disinter it. He now believes the child was alive and was saved by Bertuccio. He deduces that Monte Cristo, by mentioning a disinterred child, knows their secret. Villefort then directly accuses Madame Danglars of infanticide. Overwhelmed with terror, she begs for mercy. Villefort, speaking as a judge, not a husband, gives her a choice: face public execution for her crimes (including the poisonings of the Saint-Mérans, Barrois, and Valentine, for which he believes she is responsible) or take her own life to preserve his and Edward's honor. He locks her in the room. A dragoon then delivers a dispatch: Benedetto (Andrea Cavalcanti) has been arrested at Compiègne. Villefort, overjoyed, declares, ""I only wanted a murder, and here it is. It will be a splendid session!""

**Chapter 68: A Summer Ball**
Albert de Morcerf returns from Tréport and visits Monte Cristo, who pretends indifference. Monte Cristo subtly reveals details about the Auteuil dinner, confirming Albert's exclusion. Albert mentions his upcoming marriage to Eugénie Danglars, expressing his distaste for it. Mercédès, distressed by the recent events, asks Albert to encourage Monte Cristo to eat in their house. In the garden, Mercédès offers Monte Cristo fruit and proposes the ""bread and salt"" ritual of eternal friendship. Monte Cristo refuses, then, with bitter irony, speaks of his past: his imprisonment, his father's death, and Mercédès's marriage to Fernand. He reveals his vengeance is directed at ""the fisherman Fernand, the husband of Mercédès the Catalane."" Albert interrupts with the news of M. de Saint-Méran's sudden death from apoplexy, and Madame de Saint-Méran's critical illness. Mercédès is deeply shaken, acknowledging her friendship with Monte Cristo.

**Chapter 69: The Inquiry**
Villefort, seeking to understand Monte Cristo's knowledge, requests information on him from M. de Boville (the police official). Boville reports that Monte Cristo is known as an acquaintance of Lord Wilmore (a wealthy English eccentric) and the Abbé Busoni (a respected Sicilian priest). Villefort initiates further inquiries into these two. An agent visits the ""Abbé Busoni"" (Monte Cristo in disguise), who claims Monte Cristo is Zaccone, a Maltese shipbuilder's son, and that he purchased Monte Cristo Island to gain a title. He states Monte Cristo's fortune is 150-200,000 livres per annum. He denies knowing much about Zaccone's youth and states he is a Lutheran. He claims Monte Cristo bought the Auteuil house to convert it into a lunatic asylum. The agent then visits ""Lord Wilmore"" (Monte Cristo in another disguise), who claims Monte Cristo is a former naval officer, fought in India, discovered a silver mine in Thessaly (source of his immense wealth), and is developing a new telegraph system. Wilmore, playing Monte Cristo's enemy, claims Monte Cristo seduced his friend's wife and wounded him in three duels. Wilmore (Monte Cristo) removes his disguise after the agent leaves. Villefort, still uneasy, but without concrete proof, finds some temporary peace.

**Chapter 70: The Ball**
At the Morcerf ball, Madame Danglars attends, persuaded by Villefort. Albert discusses Monte Cristo with Madame de Villefort, who repeats the ""police information"" (supplied by Monte Cristo's alter egos) about his identity and supposed ventures. Monte Cristo arrives, exchanging a formal bow with a pale Mercédès. Danglars reports his financial losses. Mercédès, trying to reconcile, takes Monte Cristo to the garden, offering him fruit and the ritual of ""bread and salt"" for eternal friendship. Monte Cristo refuses, declaring his vengeance against ""the fisherman Fernand, the husband of Mercédès the Catalane."" Albert interrupts with news of M. de Saint-Méran's death and Madame de Saint-Méran's illness, impacting Valentine's inheritance. Mercédès, deeply distressed, reiterates her friendship with Monte Cristo, who is also pale.

**Chapter 71: Bread and Salt**
In the Morcerf conservatory, Mercédès again offers Monte Cristo fruit and reminds him of the Arabian custom of ""bread and salt"" for eternal friendship. Monte Cristo refuses to eat under her roof, stating his vow of vengeance against Fernand, who married Mercédès. He tells her of his imprisonment and his father's death. Mercédès, shattered, confesses her guilt and regrets. Albert interrupts, announcing the death of M. de Saint-Méran and the severe illness of Madame de Saint-Méran, Valentine's grandparents. Mercédès, with great effort, leads Monte Cristo back to the ballroom.

**Chapter 72: Madame de Saint-Méran**
Villefort, in his study, reflects on his enemies and the Auteuil crime, fearing exposure by Monte Cristo. His mother-in-law, Madame de Saint-Méran, arrives, distraught, announcing her husband's sudden death from an apoplectic stroke. She describes his symptoms. She insists on Valentine's marriage to Franz d’Épinay as soon as possible and wants to make a new will leaving everything to Valentine."
The Decameron-Giovanni Boccaccio,"The Decameron begins with a Proem where the author, Giovanni Boccaccio, expresses his compassion for the afflicted, particularly women suffering from love. He recounts his own past experience of a ""high and noble passion"" that caused him great travail due to an ""ill-ordered appetite."" He credits the ""pleasant discourse"" and ""admirable consolations"" of a friend for his survival. Now free from the pangs of this love, he feels it is his duty to offer comfort to ""lovesick ladies,"" who are often confined and lack the diversions available to men. To this end, he purposes to recount ""an hundred stories"" told over ten days by a company of seven ladies and three young men, who formed during the recent ""deadly pestilence."" These stories will offer both solace and useful counsel.

**Day the First**

The narrative opens by describing the horrific Black Death that struck Florence in 1348. The plague manifested as swellings on the groin or armpits, followed by black or livid blotches. It was highly contagious, spreading not only from person to person but also to animals through contact with contaminated items. Neither medical knowledge nor religious supplications proved effective, and most victims died within three days. Society disintegrated: laws were ignored, neighbors shunned each other, and family members, including parents, abandoned the sick. This led to a breakdown of traditional customs, with women being tended by men out of necessity, and funerals becoming hurried affairs with few mourners. Many died in the streets or at home, their bodies often left to rot. The countryside was also affected, with farmers abandoning their crops and livestock. The author estimates over 100,000 deaths in Florence.

Amidst this devastation, seven young ladies, aged eighteen to twenty-eight, described as discreet, noble, fair, and sprightly, meet in the venerable church of Santa Maria Novella. They are Pampinea, Fiammetta, Filomena, Emilia, Lauretta, Neifile, and Elisa. Pampinea proposes that they leave the afflicted city for a country estate to preserve their lives and spirits. Filomena expresses concern that women alone cannot manage themselves effectively, suggesting the need for male guidance. Elisa agrees, noting that their male relatives have fled. Just then, three young men—Pamfilo, Filostrato, and Dioneo—enter the church. They are also agreeable and well-bred, seeking their mistresses (three of whom are among the ladies). Pampinea suggests inviting them to join their company. Neifile worries about scandal, but Filomena dismisses this, asserting that good conscience is paramount. The ladies agree, and Pampinea invites the young men to join them in a ""pure and brotherly spirit."" They accept, and preparations are made.

The next morning, Wednesday, the ten young people, accompanied by their servants, depart Florence and arrive at a beautiful palace on a hill. Dioneo, the merriest, urges them to cast off their worries and make merry. Pampinea proposes they elect a leader daily to maintain order and joy, ensuring everyone shares the ""burden of solicitude"" and ""pleasure of headship."" Pampinea is unanimously elected as the first queen. She is crowned with a laurel wreath. She then assigns duties to the servants: Parmeno as seneschal, Sirisco as purveyor/treasurer, Tindaro for the gentlemen's chambers, Misia and Licisca for the kitchen, and Chimera and Stratilia for the ladies' chambers and cleanliness. She instructs them to bring only joyous news. The company then enjoys the gardens, returning for dinner. After a splendid meal, they dance and sing. In the afternoon, after a siesta, they gather in a cool meadow, and Pampinea proposes storytelling to pass the hottest part of the day. The theme for the first day is ""of such matters as are most to his liking"" (free choice). Pamfilo is asked to tell the first story.

**The Stories of Day the First:**

1.  **Pamfilo: Master Ciappelletto.** Ciappelletto da Prato is depicted as the worst man alive: a notary who falsified documents, a joyful false witness, a blasphemer, a stirrer of discord, a murderer, and a glutton. Messer Musciatto Franzesi, a merchant, sends Ciappelletto to Burgundy to recover debts, knowing his ruthlessness. Ciappelletto falls ill at the home of two Florentine brothers (usurers). Fearing that Ciappelletto's unconfessed death would bring scandal upon them and their business (as no church would bury him), the brothers lament their predicament. Ciappelletto overhears them and, unwilling to cause them trouble, promises to handle his own death. He requests the holiest friar for confession. To the friar, Ciappelletto fabricates a life of extreme piety: weekly confessions, virginity, moderate eating (only desiring simple salads), giving away most of his inheritance to the poor, sharing business profits, righteous anger at sin, and never bearing false witness (except against a wife-beater). His gravest ""sin"" is cursing his mother as a child. The friar, amazed by such a seemingly holy man, grants him absolution. The brothers, secretly listening, are astonished by his unwavering wickedness. Ciappelletto dies shortly after receiving the sacraments. The friar, believing him a saint, convinces the convent to give him a solemn funeral. The townspeople flock to venerate ""Saint Ciappelletto,"" believing he performs miracles. Pamfilo concludes that God, looking at the purity of the suppliant's intent rather than the advocate's reprobate state, hears prayers.

2.  **Neifile: Abraham the Jew.** Jehannot de Chevigné, a Parisian merchant, tries to convert his Jewish friend, Abraham, to Christianity. Abraham agrees to convert only after observing the Christian clergy in Rome. Jehannot is distressed, fearing Abraham will be disillusioned by the corruption there. Abraham travels to Rome, where he witnesses widespread lust, gluttony, avarice, and simony among the Pope, Cardinals, and their court. He sees them actively working to undermine Christianity. However, upon returning to Paris, Abraham declares he will convert because, despite the clergy's depravity, Christianity is still growing and prospering, proving it must be divinely supported. Jehannot baptizes him, naming him Giovanni, and Abraham lives a devout life.

3.  **Filomena: Melchizedek the Jew.** Saladin, in need of money, devises a plan to extort it from a rich Jewish usurer, Melchizedek, by asking him which of the three religions (Jewish, Saracen, Christian) is the true one. Melchizedek, recognizing the trap, tells the parable of the three rings: a father has a precious ring and three equally beloved sons. To satisfy them all, he has two identical rings made and gives one to each. After his death, each son believes he has the true ring, and the question of the true heir remains pending. Melchizedek applies this to the three religions. Saladin admires his wisdom, reveals his financial need, and Melchizedek freely lends him money, gaining his lasting friendship and high position.

4.  **Dioneo: A Monk.** A lusty young monk in Lunigiana has an affair with a peasant lass in his cell. The abbot, passing by, hears them and secretly observes them. The monk, seeing the abbot's spying, quickly locks the girl in his cell and pretends to go chop wood, handing the abbot the key. The abbot, intending to catch the monk and girl, enters the cell alone. Seeing the beautiful girl, the elderly abbot is himself overcome by desire. He seduces her, telling her not to weep. The monk, hidden, observes the abbot's actions. After the abbot leaves the girl locked in the cell and returns to his room, he summons the monk to punish him. The monk, however, reproaches the abbot for not having taught him that monks use women for mortification, implying he saw the abbot's act. The abbot, realizing he's been caught, is shamed and, to avoid exposure, pardons the monk and releases the girl. They secretly continue to meet her.

5.  **Fiammetta: The Marchioness of Monferrato.** The King of France, en route to a crusade, becomes infatuated with the beautiful Marchioness of Monferrato after hearing praise of her. He arranges an unexpected visit to her castle while her husband, the Marquis, is away. The Marchioness, discerning his true intent, prepares a feast consisting solely of various dishes made from hens. During dinner, the King, noting the lack of other game, jokingly asks if only hens are born in that region, without cocks. The Marchioness wittily replies that women, though differing in attire and dignity, are all alike in nature everywhere. The King understands her subtle rebuke, realizes his folly, and, stifling his desire, departs discreetly, recognizing her virtue.

6.  **Emilia: An Honest Man and the Inquisitor.** A greedy Minor Friar, an inquisitor of heretical pravity, prosecutes a simple rich man for claiming his wine was so good ""Christ himself might drink thereof."" The inquisitor, more interested in money than justice, terrifies the man. The man pays a large sum to the inquisitor to avoid harsher punishment, receiving a yellow cross as penance. Later, the man, hearing a Gospel verse promising ""an hundredfold"" for giving things away, tells the inquisitor he pities the friars because, having seen them discard vast quantities of broth as superfluous, they will be drowned in it in the afterlife if they receive a hundredfold return. The inquisitor is enraged but cannot retaliate.

7.  **Filostrato: Bergamino and Messer Cane della Scala.** Messer Cane della Scala, a magnificent lord, suddenly becomes miserly. He dismisses all his entertainers except Bergamino, a skilled storyteller, but gives him no pay or dismissal. Bergamino, growing poor, eventually sells his fine clothes. One day, seeing Messer Cane at dinner, Bergamino tells a story: Primasso, a learned but poor scholar, visits the famously generous Abbot of Cluny. The Abbot, upon seeing Primasso (who is ill-dressed), suddenly becomes miserly and delays dinner. Primasso, having brought three loaves, eats them one by one. The Abbot, after each loaf, is informed of Primasso's eating and his own uncharacteristic avarice. Realizing his inexplicable meanness, the Abbot recognizes Primasso's hidden worth, provides him with clothes, money, and a palfrey, and apologizes. Messer Cane, understanding the allegory, laughs, recognizes his own recent avarice, pays Bergamino's expenses, and restores his generosity.

8.  **Lauretta: Guglielmo Borsiere.** Messer Ermino de' Grimaldi, an exceptionally rich but miserly Genoese gentleman, is called ""Messer Ermino Avarizia."" The worthy minstrel Guglielmo Borsiere visits Genoa. Ermino, having heard of Borsiere's reputation, receives him courteously and shows him his new house. Ermino asks Borsiere if he can suggest anything never yet seen to depict in his saloon. Borsiere wittily replies, ""Cause Liberality to be here depictured."" Ermino is so shamed that he changes his ways, becoming the most liberal and courteous gentleman in Genoa.

9.  **Elisa: The King of Cyprus.** During the reign of the first King of Cyprus, a Gascon noblewoman is raped. She seeks redress from the King, but is told he is so cowardly he tolerates countless insults to himself. Despairing of justice, the lady confronts the King, not for redress, but to ask him to teach her how he endures affronts, so she might learn to bear her own. The King, shamed by her words, awakens from his pusillanimity, cruelly avenges her wrong, and subsequently becomes a rigorous prosecutor of all who violate his crown's honor.

10. **Pampinea: Master Alberto of Bologna.** Master Alberto, an elderly but famous physician in Bologna, falls in love with the beautiful widow Madam Malgherida de' Ghisolieri. He constantly passes her house, which amuses her and her companions, who tease him about an old man being in love. When questioned, Master Alberto cleverly defends his love: old men retain the ability to discern beauty better than the young. He compares young women's choice of lovers to eating leeks: they discard the good part (the head) and eat the unpalatable leaves. He hopes they will choose him (the ""head""). The ladies are abashed but impressed by his wit, and Madam Malgherida grants him her goodwill, though only within honorable bounds.

**Conclusion of Day the First:** The sun begins to set. Pampinea, ending her reign, passes the laurel wreath to Filomena, who is elected queen for the next day. Filomena blushes but accepts. She confirms the existing rules and announces a new theme: ""of those who after being baffled by divers chances have won at last to a joyful issue beyond their hope."" Dioneo requests the privilege of telling any story he likes, regardless of the theme, which is granted. They then go to a stream, bathe, return for supper, and dance. Emilia sings a song about being content with her own beauty. The day ends with everyone retiring.

**Day the Second**

The next morning, Sunday, the company rises with the sun, enjoys the gardens, eats, dances, and then gathers by the fountain for storytelling. Neifile, as queen, commands Neifile to begin the day's tales.

**The Stories of Day the Second:**

1.  **Neifile: Martellino.** Martellino, a trickster, feigns being a cripple to get close to the body of a supposed saint, Arrigo, in Treviso, hoping to witness a miracle. His companions, Marchese and Stecchi, help him. He is laid on Arrigo's body and ""miraculously"" recovers, causing a great commotion. A Florentine recognizes him as a known trickster. The crowd, enraged, begins to beat Martellino. Marchese, to save him, falsely accuses Martellino of being a cutpurse with 100 gold florins. The Provost's sergeants intervene, arresting Martellino. Many others also accuse him of theft. The crabbed judge tortures Martellino on the strappado, but Martellino denies being in Treviso before a few hours ago, asking them to check the register. Marchese and Stecchi, fearing for Martellino's life, seek help from Sandro Agolanti, who has influence with the Prince. The Prince, amused, orders Martellino's release. Martellino returns home safe, receiving new clothes from the Prince.

2.  **Filostrato: Rinaldo d'Asti.** Rinaldo d'Asti, a merchant, is traveling from Bologna. He meets three highwaymen disguised as merchants. Rinaldo reveals his custom of praying to St. Julian for good lodging. The highwaymen rob him near Castel Guglielmo, leaving him in his shirt and barefoot in the cold snow. His servant flees. Rinaldo, unable to enter the locked town, takes shelter under a projecting house. Inside this house, a beautiful widow, the Marquis Azzo's mistress, is preparing a bath and supper for the Marquis, who unexpectedly cancels. Hearing Rinaldo's laments, the lady's maid investigates. The lady, taking pity, lets Rinaldo in, offers him the warm bath, clothes him in her late husband's attire, and shares her lavish supper. Attracted to him, she offers herself. Rinaldo gladly accepts, and they spend the night together. In the morning, she gives him money and clothes. As he enters the town, the three highwaymen who robbed him are captured for another crime, and Rinaldo's horse, clothes, and money are restored. He returns home rich, praising God and St. Julian.

3.  **Pampinea: Three Young Men and Alessandro.** Messer Tedaldo, a rich Florentine, leaves three sons (Lamberto, Tedaldo, Agolante) a great fortune, which they squander. They move to London and become successful usurers, sending a nephew, Alessandro, to manage their affairs in England. War breaks out in England, and Alessandro loses everything. Meanwhile, his uncles in Florence again squander their wealth and are imprisoned for debt. Alessandro, despairing, decides to return to Italy. Outside Bruges, he joins a company of travelers, including an Abbot of white friars and two knights. The ""Abbot"" (a young man) is attracted to Alessandro and invites him to travel together. One night, at a crowded inn, Alessandro is offered a bed in the Abbot's room. The Abbot, who is actually the King of England's daughter fleeing an unwanted marriage, reveals herself to Alessandro and secretly marries him. They travel to Rome, where she reveals her true identity to the Pope and seeks his blessing for their marriage. The Pope reconciles the angry knights (her kinsmen) and blesses the union. Alessandro, now married to a princess, returns to Florence, frees his uncles, restores their wealth, and takes Agolante with him to Paris. Through the princess's influence, Alessandro is knighted and made Earl of Cornwall. He reconciles the English King with his son and lives gloriously.

4.  **Lauretta: Landolfo Ruffolo.** Landolfo Ruffolo, a rich merchant from Ravello, loses most of his wealth on a risky venture to Cyprus. Determined to recover, he becomes a corsair and successfully plunders Turkish vessels, doubling his original fortune. On his way home, his small ship is attacked by two large Genoese carracks, who rob him and scuttle his ship, leaving him with only a poor doublet. A storm then wrecks the carrack he is on. Landolfo saves himself by clinging to a plank. The next day, he finds a chest floating nearby and uses it to stay afloat. He drifts to Corfu, where a poor woman rescues him. She discovers the chest is filled with precious jewels. Landolfo gives her the empty chest and some money, then sells the jewels, becoming twice as rich as before. He sends gifts to the woman and those who helped him, and returns home, living honorably without further trade.

5.  **Fiammetta: Andreuccio of Perugia.** Andreuccio, a horse-courser from Perugia, goes to Naples to buy horses, foolishly displaying his 500 gold florins. A beautiful Sicilian courtesan, observing him, plots to rob him. She sends an old woman (who knew Andreuccio's father) to greet him, then sends her maid to invite him to her house, posing as his long-lost sister. Andreuccio, believing her story, dines and spends the night. When he goes to relieve himself, he falls through a broken plank into a privy. The ""sister"" then locks the door and takes his money. Andreuccio escapes into the street, tries to re-enter, but is threatened by a man inside (the courtesan's bully). Despairing, he smells terrible from the ordure. He meets two thieves planning to rob the tomb of a recently buried archbishop, who was interred with a valuable ruby ring. They take him to a well to wash him, tying him with a rope. Watchmen, coming for water, pull him up, but flee in terror, thinking he is a ghost. Andreuccio escapes, meets the thieves again, and joins them in robbing the tomb. Fearing betrayal, he pockets the ruby ring first. The thieves then trap him in the tomb. New robbers arrive, and Andreuccio scares them away by grabbing one's leg. He escapes, still with the ruby, and returns to his inn. He explains his adventures to his friends and returns to Perugia, having exchanged his 500 florins for a much more valuable ruby.

6.  **Emilia: Madam Beritola.** Arrighetto Capece, a Neapolitan gentleman, is imprisoned by King Charles I after Manfred's defeat in Sicily. His pregnant wife, Madam Beritola Caracciola, flees with her 8-year-old son, Giusfredi, to Lipari, where she gives birth to another son, Scacciato. On their way back to Naples, their ship is driven by a storm to the deserted island of Ponza. While Beritola is away lamenting her husband, a pirate galley seizes the ship and her children. She lives a wild existence for months with two goats and their kids. Later, Currado Malespina, a Marquis, and his wife find her. She recounts her story. Moved by pity, Currado convinces her to return to Lunigiana with them, disguised as a widow named Cavriuola (""wild she-goat""), taking her goats with her.
    Meanwhile, the pirates had sold Giusfredi (renamed Giannotto di Procida) and Scacciato to Messer Guasparrino d'Oria in Genoa, who uses them as slaves. Giannotto grows up and leaves, eventually serving Currado Malespina in Lunigiana. He falls in love with Currado's daughter, Spina, and she with him. They are discovered in the woods by Currado, who imprisons them, planning to execute them. Currado's wife persuades him to spare their lives.
    When news arrives of Sicily's rebellion against King Charles (due to Messer Gian di Procida), Giannotto reveals his true identity as Giusfredi Capece. Currado, realizing he is of noble birth, agrees to marry him to Spina, thus erasing the dishonor. Giusfredi asks for his brother Scacciato. Currado sends a messenger to Genoa. Messer Guasparrino d'Oria, hearing the story and confirming it with the old nurse (who had also been found), marries Scacciato to his own daughter and sends them to Lunigiana.
    A messenger from Sicily then brings news that Arrighetto Capece is alive, freed during the rebellion, and has become a favored captain of King Pedro of Aragon. The family is reunited with immense joy. Both sons marry their beloveds, and the entire family is restored to their former high estate in Sicily.

7.  **Pamfilo: Alatiel.** Alatiel, the exceedingly beautiful daughter of the Soldan of Babylon, is sent to marry the King of Algarve. Her ship is shipwrecked near Majorca. She and her surviving women are rescued by Pericone da Visalgo, a gentleman who becomes infatuated with her. Unable to communicate, he seduces her by getting her drunk. Pericone's brother, Marato, also desires her and kills Pericone, then abducts Alatiel. Marato is then thrown overboard by two Genoese shipmasters who also desire her. The shipmasters fight, one killing the other, and the survivor is wounded. Alatiel is then taken by the Prince of Morea, who treats her as his wife. The Duke of Athens, the Prince's kinsman, becomes infatuated with her, murders the Prince, and abducts Alatiel. He hides her in a seaside villa.
    The Prince's courtiers suspect the Duke. The Duchess of Athens, angered by her husband's infidelity, helps her brother Constantine (the Emperor of Constantinople's son) abduct Alatiel from the Duke. Constantine takes her to Chios.
    Osbech, King of the Turks, raids Chios, captures Alatiel and Constantine, and marries Alatiel. Osbech is later killed in battle. His servant, Antiochus, becomes Alatiel's lover and flees with her to Rhodes. Antiochus falls ill and, on his deathbed, entrusts Alatiel and his wealth to his friend, a Cypriot merchant. The merchant, passing her off as his wife, becomes her lover. In Cyprus, an old servant of her father, Antigonus, recognizes her. Alatiel, weeping, recounts her many misfortunes. Antigonus devises a plan to restore her honor: she will claim she was shipwrecked and rescued by nuns, living chastely in a convent. The King of Cyprus then sends her, with Antigonus, back to her father. The Soldan, believing her fabricated story, is overjoyed. She is presented as a virgin to the King of Algarve and marries him, living happily ever after.

8.  **Elisa: The Count of Antwerp.** Gautier, Count of Antwerp, is left as regent of France by the King and his son, who are at war. The King's son's wife (the Princess) falls passionately in love with Gautier, who is handsome and virtuous. She tries to seduce him, but he, loyal to his lord, rejects her. Enraged, she tears her clothes and falsely accuses him of attempted rape. Gautier, fearing the court's envy, flees with his two young children, Louis (9, renamed Perrot) and Violante (7, renamed Jeannette). He leaves them in England with different noble families, disguised as poor children, warning them never to reveal their true identities.
    Jeannette grows up beautiful and virtuous, loved by her mistress. Her mistress's son falls sick for love of Jeannette. A doctor discovers the cause by observing the young man's pulse when Jeannette enters the room. The parents, though initially reluctant due to her perceived low birth, agree to marry them to save their son's life.
    Perrot grows up valiant and becomes the King of England's marshal after a plague kills his lord.
    Eighteen years later, the Count of Antwerp, weary of exile, returns to England, disguised as a horseboy, to find his children. He finds Perrot a great lord and Jeannette happily married.
    Meanwhile, the Queen of France, on her deathbed, confesses her false accusation against Gautier. The King, upon hearing this, proclaims a reward for news of Gautier or his children. Gautier reveals himself to Perrot and Jeannette's husband, Jamy. The King of France, overjoyed, restores Gautier to his former rank and wealth. Gautier then brings his family back together, and they all live in honor.

9.  **Filomena: Madam Ginevra.** Bernabo Lomellini of Genoa boasts about his wife Ginevra's unparalleled chastity. Ambrogiuolo of Piacenza wagers that he can seduce her. Ambrogiuolo travels to Genoa, learns about Ginevra's reputation, and bribes her maid to hide him in a chest in Ginevra's bedchamber. While she sleeps, he observes her, notes a mole under her breast, and steals some of her belongings. He returns to Paris, presents the ""evidence,"" and wins the wager. Bernabo, believing his wife unfaithful, sends a servant to kill her. Ginevra convinces the servant to spare her, take her clothes, and report her death. She disguises herself as a man (Sicurano da Finale) and travels, eventually entering the Soldan's service. Years later, she recognizes Ambrogiuolo in Acre. She plots to bring both Ambrogiuolo and Bernabo before the Soldan. Ambrogiuolo, under duress, confesses his deception. Bernabo confesses to ordering his wife's death. Ginevra reveals her true identity. Ambrogiuolo is gruesomely punished (smeared with honey and exposed to sun and insects). Ginevra is reunited with Bernabo, forgiven, enriched by the Soldan, and they return to Genoa.

10. **Dioneo: Pietro di Vinciolo and Bartolomea.** Messer Ricciardo di Chinzica, an old, impotent judge in Pisa, marries the beautiful young Bartolomea. He imposes a strict religious calendar on her, forbidding marital intimacy on many days. Bartolomea, frustrated, is captured by Paganino da Mare, a corsair, during a fishing trip. Paganino, attracted to her, keeps her. Ricciardo discovers her whereabouts and goes to Monaco to ransom her. Paganino offers Bartolomea the choice to return with her husband or stay with him. Bartolomea, having experienced Paganino's vitality in contrast to her husband's impotence and strict calendar, refuses to return to Ricciardo, making witty remarks about his ""holidays."" Ricciardo, heartbroken and shamed, returns to Pisa, falls into dotage, and dies. Paganino then marries Bartolomea, and they live happily without observing any ""holidays.""

**Conclusion of Day the Second:** Dioneo's story is met with great laughter. Filomena, as queen, abdicates, and Elisa is elected the new queen. Elisa sets the theme for the next storytelling session: ""of whoso, being assailed with some jibing speech, hath vindicated himself or hath with some ready reply or advisement escaped loss, peril or shame."" The company enjoys the Ladies' Valley, bathing and merrymaking. Pamfilo sings a love song, and everyone retires for the night, looking forward to Sunday (skipping Friday and Saturday for piety and travel).

**Day the Third**

On Sunday morning, the group travels to a new, magnificent palace on a knoll, surrounded by beautiful gardens with various trees, flowers, springs, and tamed animals. They admire the place, refresh themselves with confections and wine, and explore the garden, noting its intricate design, fountain, and diverse wildlife. After dinner and a siesta, they gather by the fountain. Filostrato, as king for the day, begins the storytelling.

**The Stories of Day the Third:**

1.  **Filostrato: Masetto of Lamporecchio.** Nuto, a gardener, quits a convent of young nuns, complaining about their demanding nature. Masetto, a lusty young man, overhears Nuto and, discerning that the nuns are sexually frustrated, decides to feign dumbness and deafness to become the new gardener. The abbess and nuns, believing him to be simple and harmless, hire him. Initially, the nuns tease and mock him. Two young nuns, discussing their strict confinement and sexual longing, decide to test the ""mute"" gardener. They discover the pleasure of intimacy with him and share their secret with three other nuns, who also join in. Eventually, the abbess herself, observing Masetto asleep in the garden, is overcome by desire and takes him to her chamber for several days. Masetto, finding himself overwhelmed by the demands of nine women, ""regains"" his speech during a night with the abbess, complaining about the burden. The abbess, realizing the truth, confesses to her nuns, and they agree to keep the secret to avoid scandal. Masetto is made bailiff, and his ""toils"" are apportioned. He eventually returns home rich and a father, having used his youth ""to good purpose.""

2.  **Pampinea: A Horsekeeper and King Agilulf.** King Agilulf of Lombardy is married to the virtuous and beautiful Queen Theodolinda. A low-born but handsome horsekeeper falls in love with the Queen. He observes the King's discreet visits to the Queen's chamber: wrapped in a mantle, with a taper and a small wand, he strikes the door twice, which is then opened by a chamberwoman. The horsekeeper procures similar attire and, after bathing, impersonates the King, entering the Queen's chamber and making love to her. The King, returning later, is surprised by the Queen's comment about his early return and realizes she has been deceived. A wise man, he decides to identify the culprit secretly to avoid public shame. He visits the servants' dormitory and, feeling the horsekeeper's racing pulse, identifies him. Instead of killing him, he subtly cuts a lock of the horsekeeper's hair to mark him. The horsekeeper, realizing he's been marked, secretly cuts a lock of hair from every other servant. The next morning, when the King summons all servants, he finds most of them with clipped hair. He understands the cleverness of the culprit, makes a general warning, and discreetly drops the matter.

3.  **Filomena: A Lady and a Friar.** A noble, witty, and beautiful Florentine lady, unhappily married to a wool-monger, falls in love with a gentleman. To communicate with him safely, she uses a seemingly devout but dull friar as an unwitting go-between. She ""confesses"" to the friar that a gentleman (her beloved) is relentlessly pursuing her and making her uneasy, asking the friar to rebuke him. The friar, believing her, scolds the gentleman. The gentleman, understanding the lady's cleverness, begins to pass by her house more frequently. The lady, wanting to show her love, ""confesses"" again, accusing the gentleman of sending her gifts (a purse and a girdle). She gives the gifts to the friar to return. The friar, incensed, delivers the gifts and scolds the gentleman more severely, inadvertently confirming the lady's affection. Later, the lady ""confesses"" that the gentleman tried to enter her chamber through a garden window. The enraged friar confronts the gentleman again, who, by now fully understanding the elaborate ruse, promises to behave. That night, the gentleman enters the lady's chamber through the open window, and they enjoy their love, mocking the foolish friar.

4.  **Pamfilo: Dom Felice and Fra Puccio.** Fra Puccio, a rich but ignorant Florentine, becomes excessively pious and neglects his beautiful young wife, Mistress Isabetta. Dom Felice, a clever and lusty monk, befriends Fra Puccio and becomes enamored of Isabetta. He devises a ""penance"" for Fra Puccio to achieve beatitude: confessing sins, fasting for 40 days, and standing naked in a crucifix position all night, every night, on a plank in a place with a view of the sky, until matins. Fra Puccio eagerly agrees. This allows Dom Felice to secretly visit Isabetta at night. One night, Fra Puccio, hearing noises from his wife's room, asks what she's doing. She wittily replies she's ""tossing"" because ""who suppeth not by night must toss till morning light,"" implying his fasting causes her sleeplessness. Fra Puccio believes her. Isabetta becomes pregnant. To avoid scandal, Dom Felice brings Fra Puccio back from ""purgatory"" (his prison cell) by giving him a sleeping draught and returning him to his tomb. Fra Puccio awakens, believing he's been resurrected, and attributes his cure from jealousy to the Abbot's prayers. He raises the child, Benedict, as his own, and remains cured of his jealousy, allowing his wife and the monk to continue their affair discreetly.

5.  **Elisa: Ricciardo, surnamed Il Zima.** Messer Francesco Vergellesi, a wealthy but avaricious gentleman of Pistoia, desires a beautiful palfrey owned by Ricciardo (Il Zima), who is secretly in love with Messer Francesco's wife. Il Zima offers the palfrey as a gift on the condition that he be allowed to speak with Messer Francesco's wife in her husband's presence, but unheard by others. Messer Francesco, confident in his wife's virtue and his own cleverness, agrees and instructs his wife, Caterina, not to speak a word. Il Zima delivers a passionate declaration of love. When Caterina remains silent, he, realizing the husband's trick, cleverly ""answers"" himself on her behalf, promising to fulfill their love when her husband leaves for Milan. He also indicates a signal (two napkins in a window). The husband, believing his wife's silence indicates disdain, is pleased. After the husband departs, Caterina, moved by Il Zima's love and recognizing her husband's foolishness, displays the napkins. Il Zima comes, and they consummate their love.

6.  **Fiammetta: Ricciardo Minutolo.** Ricciardo Minutolo of Naples is desperately in love with Catella, the beautiful and virtuous wife of Filippello Fighinolfi, who is fiercely jealous. Ricciardo, unable to gain her affection, pretends to fall in love with another woman. This convinces Catella he no longer loves her, and she becomes less guarded. At a seaside gathering, Ricciardo subtly hints that Filippello is having an affair and plans to meet his new mistress at a specific bagnio (bathhouse) the next day. Catella, consumed by jealousy, vows to go in her place to shame him. Ricciardo arranges with the bagnio keeper. The next day, Catella goes to the bagnio, thinking she will confront her husband, but instead finds Ricciardo in the dark room. They make love, with Catella believing it is Filippello. After their intimacy, Catella furiously berates him, revealing her true identity and the depth of her rage. Ricciardo then reveals his own identity. Catella is shocked but, realizing she has been outwitted and has enjoyed the encounter, eventually forgives him. They continue their affair discreetly.

7.  **Emilia: Tedaldo Elisei.** Tedaldo Elisei, a Florentine nobleman, loves Madam Ermellina, who suddenly rejects him. Heartbroken, he leaves Florence without telling anyone but a close friend, becoming a wealthy merchant in Cyprus. After seven years, hearing a song he wrote about his love for Ermellina, he is overcome with longing and returns, disguised as a pilgrim. He learns that his brothers have accused Ermellina's husband, Aldobrandino Palermini, of murdering ""Tedaldo Elisei"" (who was actually a stranger resembling him). Aldobrandino is imprisoned.
    Tedaldo, in his pilgrim disguise, enters Ermellina's house and finds her distraught. He tells her he is a messenger from God and knows her ""sin"" (her earlier rejection of him). He reveals details of her life and her husband's predicament, convincing her he is a prophet. He tells her the true Tedaldo is alive and she must restore her love to him. He then reveals his true identity to her. Ermellina, overjoyed and horrified, recognizes him.
    Tedaldo then visits Aldobrandino in prison, still disguised, and convinces him to forgive his brothers. He then goes to a magistrate, reveals the true murderers (the innkeepers where he overheard their confession), and clears Aldobobrandino. The innkeepers confess and are executed. Aldobrandino is freed. Tedaldo then hosts a banquet, where he reveals his identity to his brothers and the assembled guests. He reconciles his brothers with Aldobrandino. He and Ermellina resume their discreet affair.

8.  **Lauretta: Ferondo.** A lusty abbot falls in love with the beautiful wife of Ferondo, a rich but dull-witted farmer who is fiercely jealous. The abbot, a clever man, devises a scheme. He tells the wife that to cure Ferondo's jealousy, he must ""go to purgatory"" (die and return). He gives Ferondo a powerful sleeping powder (from the Old Man of the Mountain) that makes him appear dead for three days. Ferondo's wife and kinsfolk, believing him dead, bury him. The abbot and a trusted monk secretly remove Ferondo from the tomb, dress him as a monk, and imprison him in a dark vault. The Bolognese monk (his accomplice) then beats and starves Ferondo, convincing him he is in purgatory as punishment for his jealousy. The abbot, meanwhile, enjoys an affair with Ferondo's wife, often visiting her at night. After the wife becomes pregnant, the abbot uses a fake voice to tell Ferondo (in ""purgatory"") that his good conduct has earned him a return to life, and he will have a son named Benedict. Ferondo is given another sleeping draught, returned to his tomb, and ""resurrected."" He believes the purgatory story, is cured of his jealousy, and raises the abbot's child as his own.

9.  **Pampinea: Gillette de Narbonne.** Gillette, the daughter of a physician, is deeply in love with Bertrand, the young Count of Roussillon, who is entrusted to the King of France. Bertrand disdains Gillette due to her lower birth. The King suffers from an incurable fistula. Gillette, using her father's medical knowledge, cures the King. As a reward, she asks for Bertrand as her husband. Bertrand, greatly against his will, is forced to marry her by the King. He immediately flees to Florence to fight in a war, vowing never to live with Gillette until she has his ring (a prized family heirloom) and a child conceived by him. Gillette, now Countess of Roussillon, manages his estate magnificently, earning the love of his vassals. She then follows Bertrand to Florence, disguised as a pilgrim. She learns that Bertrand is pursuing a poor but beautiful young lady. Gillette bribes the lady's mother to help her: the mother will persuade her daughter to demand Bertrand's ring as proof of his love. Gillette, in the dark, then takes the daughter's place in bed with Bertrand. She conceives twin sons and obtains his ring. When she is heavily pregnant, she reveals herself to Bertrand in Montpellier, presenting the ring and the children. Bertrand, recognizing his ring and children, and impressed by her patience and wit, accepts her as his wife, and they live happily ever after.

10. **Dioneo: Alibech.** Alibech, a beautiful and simple 14-year-old Saracen girl from Capsa, desires to serve God. She travels to the desert of Thebais and finds a young hermit named Rustico. He agrees to teach her how to ""serve God"" by ""putting the devil in hell,"" which is a euphemism for sexual intercourse. Rustico, overcome with desire, undresses himself and Alibech. He teaches her the ""service,"" explaining his erect penis as the ""devil"" and her vagina as ""hell."" Alibech, initially experiencing some pain, soon finds the act delightful and becomes very enthusiastic about ""serving God."" She constantly requests to ""put the devil in hell,"" exhausting Rustico. Meanwhile, her father dies in a fire, making her sole heir. A young man, Neerbale, finds her and brings her back to Capsa, marrying her. When asked by other women how she served God in the desert, Alibech explains ""putting the devil in hell."" The women laugh and tell her Neerbale will also help her serve God in this manner.

**Conclusion of Day the Third:** Dioneo's story causes much laughter. Filostrato, as king, passes the laurel wreath to Elisa. Elisa maintains the custom of no storytelling on Friday or Saturday for piety and travel to a new location. She sets the theme for Day 4: ""of those whose loves have had unhappy ending."" They enjoy the garden, and Pamfilo sings a song. Everyone then retires.

**Day the Fourth**

The author prefaces this day with a defense against his critics, acknowledging that some find his stories too licentious or his focus on women unseemly for his age. He argues that he writes for ""idle women"" who seek diversion, that his stories are true to life, and that virtue and vice are in the eye of the beholder. He also implies that his critics are hypocritical and that he is merely reflecting human nature. He then recounts a partial story of Filippo Balducci, who raised his son in isolation from women, only for the son to immediately desire ""green geese"" (women) upon seeing them in Florence, illustrating the power of nature. He re-emphasizes that love transforms, even the most ignorant. He concludes by stating his intention to continue pleasing his audience. The company rises, dines, sleeps, and then gathers by the fountain. Filostrato, as king, begins the day's somber theme.

**The Stories of Day the Fourth:**

1.  **Fiammetta: Tancred and Ghismonda.** Tancred, Prince of Salerno, dotes on his only daughter, Ghismonda. After she is widowed, he delays her remarriage. Ghismonda secretly falls in love with Guiscardo, a low-born but worthy servant. They meet in a secret grotto accessible from her chamber. One day, Tancred falls asleep in Ghismonda's chamber and witnesses their intimacy. Enraged but suppressing his anger, he waits until they leave. He has Guiscardo captured and imprisoned. The next day, Tancred confronts Ghismonda, expressing his grief and shame at her choice of a low-born lover. Ghismonda, composed and defiant, neither denies her love nor begs for mercy. She passionately defends her choice, arguing that true nobility lies in virtue, not birth, and that love transcends social status. She asserts her right to love and challenges her father to wreak his cruelty upon her. Tancred, moved but unwilling to openly pardon, has Guiscardo strangled and his heart sent to Ghismonda in a golden cup. Ghismonda, receiving the heart, laments her lover, pours a poison she had prepared into the cup, drinks it, and dies. Tancred, filled with belated remorse, buries them together in one tomb.

2.  **Pampinea: Fra Alberto.** Berto della Massa, a wicked Florentine, flees to Venice, where he becomes Fra Alberto, a Minor Friar, feigning sanctity and performing ""miracles.""

He tells her that the Angel Gabriel is enamored of her beauty and wishes to lie with her, but will do so in Fra Alberto's body while his soul is in Paradise. Lisetta, believing him, agrees. Fra Alberto, disguised as the angel, visits her at night. Lisetta, in her vanity, boasts of her angelic lover to a gossip. The gossip spreads the tale throughout Venice, reaching Lisetta's brothers-in-law, who set a trap. Fra Alberto, sensing danger, escapes by jumping into the Grand Canal. He is rescued by a poor man, whom he bribes. To escape the city, he agrees to be disguised as a ""wild man"" for a festival.

They steal money and jewels, board a brigantine, and sail to Crete, where they buy land and live luxuriously. Restagnone, growing weary of Ninetta due to over-abundance, falls for another woman. Ninetta, consumed by jealousy, poisons him. He dies, and they bury him. Later, the old woman who made the poison is caught for another crime and confesses Ninetta's deed. The Duke of Crete arrests Ninetta. Folco and Ughetto try to save her. Maddalena, to save her sister from being burned, secretly offers herself to the Duke. The Duke agrees, pretending to execute Ninetta but secretly delivering her to Maddalena. Folco, suspecting Maddalena's infidelity, forces her to confess and then kills her. He flees with Ninetta, disappearing. Ughetto and Bertella are wrongly accused of Maddalena's murder, bribe their jailers, and flee to Rhodes, where they die in poverty.

She, in turn, loves him through hearsay. They exchange letters and gifts. The King of Tunis, aware of Gerbino's feelings, gives his daughter to the King of Granada, sending her by sea. King Guglielmo pledges safe passage. Gerbino, ignoring his grandfather's pledge, equips two galleys and intercepts her ship near Sardinia. He demands the lady.

He dismisses dreams as folly, but Andrevuola remains fearful. That night, in the garden, as they embrace, Gabriotto suddenly dies in her arms. Andrevuola, distraught but determined to protect her honor and his body, seeks her maid's help. They decide to lay his body at his door to make it seem he died in the street. As they carry him, they are discovered by the city watch. Andrevuola, embracing death, confesses to the Provost. Physicians confirm Gabriotto died of a natural cause (a burst imposthume). The Provost, attracted to Andrevuola, tries to seduce her, but she fiercely resists. Her father, Messer Negro, arrives, demands her release, and is informed of her story.

Pasquino invites Simona to a garden for a private meeting, accompanied by their friends. In the garden, Pasquino rubs a sage leaf on his teeth, then suddenly dies, his face turning swollen and spotted. Simona, accused of poisoning him by Pasquino's friends, is brought before a judge. To prove her innocence, she re-enacts the event, rubbing a sage leaf on her own teeth, and immediately dies. The judge orders the sage bush cut down.

He tries to rekindle her affection, but she appears to have forgotten him. One evening, he secretly enters her house and finds her asleep with her husband. He awakens her, professing his undying love. Salvestra, now a virtuous wife, rejects him, urging him to leave. Girolamo, despairing, asks for one last comfort: to lie beside her to warm himself, promising not to touch her. She agrees. He then voluntarily ""restrains his vital spirits"" and dies by her side. Salvestra, distraught, wakes her husband and, feigning that it happened to a friend, asks for advice. He suggests leaving the body at the dead man's door. He carries Girolamo's body to his house. The next morning, Girolamo's death is discovered. His mother laments. Salvestra, attending the funeral, is overcome by grief, casts herself on his body, and dies. They are buried together.

Ruggieri, visiting the wife, accidentally drinks the sleeping draught, appearing dead. The wife and her maid, fearing scandal, put Ruggieri's ""corpse"" into an empty chest outside their neighbor the carpenter's shop. Two usurers, planning to steal the chest, take it to their house. Ruggieri awakens inside the chest. He escapes, is discovered, and arrested as a thief. The physician's maid, to save Ruggieri and her mistress's honor, confesses a fabricated story to the physician: she brought Ruggieri into the house, gave him the water (without knowing what it was), and hid him when the physician returned. The maid then repeats a similar, carefully constructed lie to the Prefect, explaining how the chest was stolen and Ruggieri was mistakenly found within. The Prefect, verifying parts of the story, releases Ruggieri and fines the usurers. Ruggieri and the physician's wife continue their affair, laughing at their adventure.

**Conclusion of Day the Fourth:** Dioneo's story brings much laughter, relieving the somber mood. Filostrato, as king, passes the crown to Fiammetta, praising her beauty and wit. Fiammetta sets the theme for Day 5: ""of that which hath happily betided lovers after sundry cruel and unfortunate adventures."" The company enjoys the garden, supper, dancing, and singing. Filostrato sings a melancholic song about betrayed love, hinting at his own unhappiness. The day ends, and everyone retires.

**Day the Fifth**

The fifth day begins with Fiammetta, the new queen, leading the company through the dewy fields, enjoying the sweet bird songs. They return to the palace, refresh themselves, and enjoy the garden until dinner. After a merry dinner and dancing, they rest. In the afternoon, they gather by the fountain for storytelling. Pamfilo is chosen to begin the day's theme of happy endings for lovers after misfortune.

**The Stories of Day the Fifth:**

1.  **Pamfilo: Cimon and Iphigenia.** Aristippus, a noble Cypriot, has a dull-witted son, Galesus, nicknamed Cimon (""brute beast""). Cimon is sent to live in the countryside.

He changes his name back to Galesus. He seeks to marry Iphigenia, but her father has promised her to Pasimondas of Rhodes. On her wedding day, Cimon abducts her at sea, defeating the Rhodian escort. A sudden storm shipwrecks them near Rhodes, where Pasimondas and his party are also seeking shelter. Cimon and his men are imprisoned. Lysimachus, the Rhodian chief magistrate, is also in love with Cassandra, Pasimondas's brother Ormisdas's bride. Lysimachus conspires with Cimon to abduct both brides on their wedding day. They storm Pasimondas's house, kill Pasimondas and Ormisdas, and escape with Iphigenia and Cassandra. They flee to Crete, marry their beloveds, and later, after an exile, are reconciled with their families and return home to live happily.

2.  **Emilia: Costanza and Martuccio Gomito.** Costanza, a beautiful girl from Lipari, loves Martuccio Gomito, a capable but poor young man. Her father refuses their marriage due to Martuccio's poverty. Martuccio leaves to become a rich corsair. News arrives that Martuccio and his crew have drowned. Despairing, Costanza secretly takes a small boat out to sea, intending to die. A gentle wind carries her, asleep, to Susa in Barbary. A Trapanese woman, Carapresa, finds her and takes her to a kind old Saracen lady. Costanza learns the local language. Meanwhile, Martuccio, captured by Saracens, is imprisoned in Tunis. He gives King Mariabdela military advice on defeating an attacking enemy (by using thinner bowstrings). The King, victorious, rewards Martuccio richly. Costanza learns Martuccio is alive and prosperous. She reveals her story to the old lady, who takes her to Tunis. Carapresa reunites Costanza with Martuccio. The King, hearing their story, blesses their marriage. They return to Lipari with great wealth and live happily.

3.  **Elisa: Pietro Boccamazza and Agnolella.** Pietro Boccamazza, a Roman nobleman, loves Agnolella, a plebeian girl. His family forbids their marriage. They elope. On their journey, they are attacked by footmen. Agnolella flees into a wood, while Pietro is captured. Pietro is about to be hanged by the footmen (who are enemies of his family) when another band of footmen attacks. Pietro escapes in the confusion and searches for Agnolella in the wood. He spends a terrified night in an oak tree, witnessing wolves devour his horse. Agnolella, meanwhile, is rescued by an old couple and taken to a nearby castle, where the lady of the castle, Lionello di Campodifiore's wife, a friend of Pietro's, takes her in. Pietro finds his way to the same castle. Overjoyed, he is reunited with Agnolella. The lady of the castle, impressed by their love and survival, marries them at her expense and helps them reconcile with their families in Rome. They live happily ever after.

4.  **Filostrato: Ricciardo Manardi and Caterina.** Ricciardo Manardi loves Caterina, the beautiful daughter of Messer Lizio da Valbona and Madam Giacomina. Caterina also loves Ricciardo. To meet secretly, Caterina complains of heat and requests a bed in a gallery overlooking her father's garden. Her father initially refuses, but her mother persuades him. Ricciardo climbs to the gallery at night. They spend the night in passion, making love many times. In the morning, Messer Lizio, checking on his daughter, discovers them asleep, naked and embracing. He, a wise man, decides to make the best of the situation rather than cause a scandal. He tells his wife, who is also initially shocked, that Ricciardo is noble and rich, and they should force him to marry Caterina. Ricciardo, awakened, is terrified but readily agrees to marry her. They are immediately married with a borrowed ring. A few days later, they celebrate a formal wedding and live happily.

5.  **Neifile: Guidotto da Cremona's Daughter (Agnesa).** Guidotto da Cremona, a Lombard, on his deathbed, leaves his ten-year-old daughter to his friend Giacomino da Pavia. Giacomino moves to Faenza with the girl, Agnesa, and raises her. Agnesa grows into a beautiful and virtuous young woman, loved by two young men: Giannole di Severino and Minghino di Mingole. Both want to marry her but are forbidden by their families due to her unknown origins. Each tries to abduct her. One night, both Giannole and Minghino plan to enter the house. Giannole, with the help of Giacomino's servant Crivello, enters first and tries to carry Agnesa off. Minghino, alerted by the commotion, intervenes, leading to a brawl. The captain's officers arrest many, including Giannole, Minghino, and Crivello. Giacomino learns that Agnesa is actually a Faentine girl, forgotten during a war when her house was plundered by Guidotto. A witness, Guiglielmino da Medicina, confirms the story and identifies Agnesa's true father, Bernabuccio. Bernabuccio recognizes Agnesa by a scar. The captain releases the young men. Agnesa is reunited with her family and marries Minghino.

6.  **Pampinea: Gianni di Procida and Restituta.** Restituta, a beautiful girl from Ischia, loves Gianni di Procida, who swims from his island to hers to see her. She is abducted by Sicilian corsairs and presented to King Frederick of Sicily, who houses her in a beautiful pavilion called La Cuba. Gianni tracks her to Palermo, discovers her location, and manages to secretly enter her chamber at night. They spend the night together. King Frederick, desiring her, arrives unexpectedly at dawn and discovers them asleep. Enraged, he orders them to be publicly burned. They are bound to a stake in Palermo. Ruggieri dell' Oria, the King's admiral, recognizes Gianni. He intervenes with King Frederick, reminding him that Gianni's uncle, Messer Gian di Procida, helped him become king. He also highlights Restituta's noble birth and their long-standing love. The King, chastened, pardons and releases them, then arranges for their marriage. He gives them magnificent presents, and they return happily to Ischia.

7.  **Lauretta: Teodoro and Violante.** Messer Amerigo Abate of Trapani buys a boy, Teodoro, among other ""Turkish"" slaves. Teodoro, baptized Pietro, grows up with Amerigo's children and becomes his trusted chief servant. Pietro and Violante, Amerigo's daughter, fall in love. During a hailstorm, they take shelter in a hut, where their desires are consummated. Violante becomes pregnant. Pietro, fearing for his life, plans to flee, but Violante persuades him to stay, promising to protect him. Violante confesses her pregnancy (but not the father) to her mother. Amerigo discovers her delivery, forces her to reveal Pietro as the father, and condemns Pietro to be flogged and hanged. He also sends a servant to offer Violante poison or a dagger, and to kill the newborn child. On his way to execution, Pietro is recognized by Fineo, an Armenian ambassador, as his long-lost son, Teodoro. Fineo intervenes, stopping the execution. Amerigo, distraught by his cruelty, learns his daughter is still alive. Teodoro and Violante are reunited and married, with Fineo's blessing. They return to Lazistan with Fineo, living happily with their son.

8.  **Filomena: Nastagio degli Onesti.** Nastagio degli Onesti, a rich young man from Ravenna, loves a proud and cruel lady of the Traversari family, who disdains him. He wastes his fortune trying to win her love. His friends advise him to leave Ravenna. He moves to Chiassi, where, one Friday in May, he wanders into a pine-wood. He witnesses a terrifying apparition: a naked lady being pursued and bitten by two mastiffs, followed by a knight in black armor who repeatedly kills her, rips out her heart and entrails, and feeds them to the dogs. The knight, Messer Guido degli Anastagi, explains he was Nastagio's ancestor, who killed himself for unrequited love for this same lady. As punishment, they are condemned to re-enact this chase and murder every Friday in that wood. Nastagio, horrified, sees an opportunity. He arranges a magnificent outdoor dinner in the same spot for the following Friday, inviting his beloved, her family, and other ladies. The guests witness the gruesome spectacle. The proud lady, terrified of suffering the same fate for her cruelty, immediately sends a messenger to Nastagio, agreeing to marry him. They marry the following Sunday, and the story causes all the ladies of Ravenna to become more amenable to their lovers' desires.

9.  **Fiammetta: Federigo degli Alberighi.** Coppo di Borghese Domenichi, a respected Florentine, tells the story of Federigo degli Alberighi. Federigo, a noble and valiant youth, falls in love with the virtuous Madam Giovanna, but she doesn't return his affections. He squanders his wealth on lavish entertainments for her, until only a small farm and his prized falcon remain. He moves to the farm, living humbly. Giovanna's husband dies, leaving her a rich widow with a son. The son becomes friends with Federigo and greatly desires his falcon. The son falls ill, and believing the falcon will cure him, asks his mother for it. Giovanna, despite her reluctance to ask Federigo for his last possession, resolves to do so. She visits him at his farm, bringing a companion, and requests to dine with him. Federigo, overjoyed but impoverished, has nothing to offer but his beloved falcon, which he kills and serves for dinner. After the meal, Giovanna reveals her true purpose, asking for the falcon for her son. Federigo, weeping, explains what he has done, showing her the falcon's feathers. Giovanna, dismayed, returns to her son, who soon dies. Her brothers urge her to remarry. She declares she will marry only Federigo, preferring ""a man that lacketh of riches than riches that lack of a man."" Impressed by Federigo's magnanimity, her brothers agree. Federigo marries Giovanna and becomes wealthy again, living happily.

10. **Dioneo: Pietro di Vinciolo.** Pietro di Vinciolo, a rich Perugian man, is known for his unnatural preferences, so he marries to create a facade. His young, lusty wife, Peronella, discovers his true inclinations and resolves to take lovers discreetly. She enlists an old ""saintly"" woman as a go-between. One evening, Pietro is supposed to dine out. Peronella brings a young lover, Giannello Strignario, to her house. Pietro unexpectedly returns. Peronella quickly hides Giannello in a large empty vat in an adjoining shed. She then opens the door to Pietro, loudly berating him for his early return and perceived laziness. Pietro, oblivious, announces he has returned because it's a holiday and he has sold the vat for five florins to a man waiting outside. Peronella quickly claims she has already sold the vat for seven florins to a man who is currently ""inspecting"" its soundness inside. Giannello, overhearing, emerges from the vat, pretending he knew nothing of Pietro's return. He complains the vat is dirty. Peronella insists Pietro clean it. Pietro enters the vat to scrape it clean. While Pietro is inside the vat, Peronella positions herself at its mouth, ostensibly directing his cleaning, but actually allowing Giannello to complete their interrupted tryst. Giannello pays Pietro the seven florins, and the vat is taken away.

**Conclusion of Day the Fifth:** Dioneo's story causes much laughter. Fiammetta passes the crown to Elisa. Elisa maintains the usual rules (no stories on Friday/Saturday) and sets the theme for Day 6: ""of whoso, being assailed with some jibing speech, hath vindicated himself or hath with some ready reply or advisement escaped loss, peril or shame."" The ladies then go to the ""Ladies' Valley"" for bathing, a place they find exceptionally beautiful and refreshing. The men later visit the valley, admiring its beauty. Pamfilo sings a song about his intense love. Everyone retires for the night.

**Day the Sixth**

On Sunday morning, the group rises, enjoys a leisurely walk, attends divine service at a nearby church, then returns to the palace for breakfast, songs, and dancing. Afterwards, they gather by the fountain for storytelling. Before the first story, a loud clamor erupts from the kitchen. It is Licisca and Tindaro arguing. Licisca, a spirited old servant, is angry that Tindaro, a young male servant, is trying to teach her about women. She asserts her knowledge of women's ways, including their early loss of virginity and their cunning with husbands. Dioneo, called upon by the queen to judge, sides with Licisca, declaring Tindaro an ass. The queen silences Licisca and Tindaro and then bids Filomena to begin the day's tales.

**The Stories of Day the Sixth:**

1.  **Filomena: Madam Oretta.** Madam Oretta, a noble and well-spoken Florentine lady, is walking with a company of friends in the countryside. A gentleman offers to entertain her by ""carrying her a-horseback"" with a story. He begins, but tells the story so poorly, repeating himself and mixing up details, that it becomes agonizing. Madam Oretta, unable to bear it, politely asks him to ""set her down"" from his horse, as it has ""too hard a trot."" The gentleman, understanding her witty critique, laughs, stops the story, and changes the subject.

2.  **Pampinea: Cisti the Baker.** Cisti, a rich baker in Florence, renowned for his refined taste in wine, notices Messer Geri Spina (Madam Oretta's husband) and papal ambassadors passing his bakehouse daily. He devises a subtle way to offer them his excellent white wine without presumption: he places a fresh pail of water, a pitcher of his wine, and two silver-like goblets outside his door, then ostentatiously drinks the wine himself. Messer Geri, intrigued, eventually asks if the wine is good. Cisti invites them to taste it, refusing to let the servants pour. They find the wine superb. Later, Messer Geri hosts a banquet and sends a servant with a large flask to Cisti for wine. Cisti tells the servant Messer Geri did not send him. The servant returns, confused. Messer Geri, understanding Cisti's subtle message about the flask's size (implying the wine is too fine for common use), sends a smaller, more appropriate flask. Cisti gladly fills it. That day, Cisti sends a whole small cask of the wine to Messer Geri, who appreciates his refined understanding and generosity.

3.  **Lauretta: Madam Nonna de' Pulci.** Messer Antonio d'Orso, Bishop of Florence, and Messer Dego della Ratta, King Robert's marshal, are riding through the city during a festival. The marshal had previously paid a husband 500 gilded silver coins to lie with his wife, who was the Bishop's kinswoman. The Bishop, pretending ignorance of this scandal, points out Madam Nonna de' Pulci, a beautiful and witty lady, to the marshal and asks her if she could conquer such a gallant man. Madam Nonna, perceiving the slight to her honor and knowing the marshal's past offense, retorts, ""Maybe, sir, he would not make a conquest of me; but, in any case, I should want good money."" Both men are shamed, the marshal for his past act and the bishop for his kinswoman's dishonor, and they ride off in silence.

4.  **Neifile: Chichibio the Cook.** Currado Gianfigliazzi, a noble Florentine, catches a fat crane and tells his Venetian cook, Chichibio, to roast it. Chichibio's mistress, Brunetta, asks for a thigh, and he gives it to her. At dinner, Currado is surprised to see the crane with only one leg. Chichibio confidently asserts that cranes have only one leg. Currado, enraged, threatens him and says he will prove it the next morning. The next day, Currado takes Chichibio to a river where cranes roost. Chichibio points out a dozen cranes standing on one leg, as they sleep. Currado shouts ""Ho! Ho!"" and the cranes put down their second legs and fly away. Chichibio, quick-witted, replies that if Currado had shouted ""Ho! Ho!"" to the crane yesterday, it too would have put down its other leg. Currado, amused, laughs and forgives him.

5.  **Pamfilo: Messer Forese da Rabatta and Master Giotto.** Messer Forese da Rabatta, a learned but ugly lawyer, and Master Giotto, a brilliant but equally ugly painter, are returning from Mugello on sorry horses, dressed in old borrowed cloaks, after being caught in a sudden shower. They are drenched and muddy. Forese, observing Giotto's disheveled state, jokes, ""Giotto, if a stranger saw you now, would he believe you were the finest painter in the world?"" Giotto quickly retorts, ""Sir, I think he would believe it if, looking at you, he believed you knew your A B C."" Forese realizes his own equally poor appearance and is silenced.

6.  **Fiammetta: Michele Scalza and the Cadgers.** Michele Scalza, a merry Florentine, argues that the ""Cadgers"" (beggars) of Florence are the oldest and best gentlemen in the world. He makes a wager with Neri Mannini. Before a judge, Piero di Fiorentino, Scalza ""proves"" his claim by arguing that God made the Cadgers when he was first learning to draw, explaining their diverse and ""ill-composed"" features. Other people, he argues, were made after God had learned better. Therefore, Cadgers are the oldest and noblest. The judge and all present, amused, agree that Scalza has won the supper.

7.  **Filostrato: Madam Filippa.** In Prato, a cruel statute condemns women caught in adultery to be burned. Madam Filippa, found by her husband Rinaldo de' Pugliesi with her lover Lazzerino, is brought to justice. Despite advice to deny the charge, she bravely appears before the Provost. She admits her affair but argues that laws should be common and made with the consent of those they concern. She points out that no women were consulted for this law. She then asks her husband if she ever denied him her favors. Rinaldo admits she never did. Filippa then argues that if her husband always had what he needed, what was she to do with the ""remainder""? Should she ""cast it to the dogs""? She implies it's better to satisfy a lover than let it go to waste. The townspeople, amused and recognizing the injustice, demand the law be changed. The statute is modified to apply only to women who sell their favors for money. Filippa is acquitted and returns home triumphant.

8.  **Emilia: Fresco and Ciesca.** Fresco da Celatico has a vain and critical niece, Ciesca, who constantly finds fault with everyone else's appearance. One day, she returns home, sighing and complaining about how many ""disagreeable and tiresome people"" are in the city. Fresco, displeased by her airs, tells her, ""My lass, if disagreeable folk be so distasteful to thee as thou sayest, never mirror thyself in the glass, so thou wouldst live merry."" Ciesca, being dull-witted despite her perceived wisdom, fails to understand his biting irony.

9.  **Lauretta: Guido Cavalcanti.** In old Florence, gentlemen formed companies for banquets and entertainment. Guido Cavalcanti, a renowned logician and philosopher (and rumored Epicurean atheist), was often sought by Messer Betto Brunelleschi's company. One day, Messer Betto and his companions, riding near San Giovanni (where there were old marble tombs), spot Guido alone among the tombs. They ride up to him, teasing, ""Guido, thou refusest to be of our company; but, harkye, whenas thou shalt have found that God is not, what wilt thou have accomplished?"" Guido, quick-witted, replies, ""Gentlemen, you may say what you will to me in your own house,"" then leaps over a tomb to escape them. The others are confused, but Messer Betto interprets Guido's meaning: the tombs are ""the houses of the dead,"" implying that compared to Guido and other learned men, they are ""worse than dead folk,"" so they were in ""their own house."" The gentlemen understand and are shamed.

10. **Dioneo: Fra Cipolla.** Fra Cipolla, a friar of St. Anthony's order, visits Certaldo annually to collect alms. He is a jolly, eloquent rascal. One Sunday, he promises to show the villagers one of the Angel Gabriel's feathers, supposedly left in the Virgin Mary's chamber. Two mischievous young men, Giovanni and Biagio, decide to play a trick. While Fra Cipolla dines, they go to his inn, find his servant Guccio distracted by a cookmaid, and replace the ""feather"" (a parrot's tail feather) in Fra Cipolla's casket with some coals. After noon, when a large crowd gathers, Fra Cipolla begins his sermon. He dramatically opens the casket, only to find coals. Without missing a beat, he improvises a grand tale of his travels to exotic lands (Berlinzone, Bengodi, Truffia, Buffia, Menzogna, India Pastinaca) and a long list of absurd relics he's collected (finger of the Holy Ghost, Cherubim's nail, Verbum Caro Get-thee-to-the-windows' rib, etc.). He then declares that he must have accidentally picked up the casket containing the coals of St. Lawrence, which is divinely appropriate given the upcoming feast day of St. Lawrence. He uses the coals to make crosses on the villagers, earning generous offerings. The tricksters, present in the crowd, laugh uncontrollably, impressed by his wit. Later, they return his feather.

**Conclusion of Day the Sixth:** Dioneo's story is highly praised for its humor. Lauretta passes the crown to Dioneo, challenging him to govern the ladies well. Dioneo accepts, promising to ensure everyone enjoys themselves. He humorously references Licisca's earlier remarks about women's behavior and sets the theme for Day 7: ""of the tricks which, or for love or for their own preservation, women have heretofore played their husbands, with or without the latter's cognizance thereof."" Some ladies initially object, but Dioneo defends the theme, arguing that in a time of plague and lax laws, freedom of speech (within decorum) is acceptable for diversion, and that their virtue is unquestionable. He also suggests that avoiding such topics might imply guilt. The ladies agree. They then visit the Ladies' Valley again, where they bathe. After supper, Pamfilo leads a dance, and Elisa sings a melancholic love song. The day ends.

**Day the Seventh**

The group, now under Dioneo's governance, travels to the Ladies' Valley. They enjoy the beautiful scenery, the fresh air, and the birds' songs. After a collation and more singing, they dine by the lake, watching the fish. Beds are set up for a siesta. After resting, they gather by the lake for storytelling. Dioneo commands Emilia to begin.

**The Stories of Day the Seventh:**

1.  **Emilia: Gianni Lotteringhi.** Gianni Lotteringhi, a simple-minded wool-comber and leader of Laudsingers in Florence, has a discreet and clever wife, Mistress Tessa, who is having an affair with Federigo di Neri Pegolotti. They arrange a signal: an ass's skull on a vine pole in her garden, turned towards Florence for a meeting, towards Fiesole if Gianni is home. One night, Federigo is to sup with Tessa, but Gianni unexpectedly returns. Tessa hides Federigo and the food. Gianni hears Federigo knocking and is convinced it's a phantom. Tessa, to communicate with Federigo and get rid of Gianni, invents a ""holy orison"" for exorcising phantoms. She leads Gianni to the door, has him spit, and loudly recites a ""conjuration"" that directs the ""phantom"" (Federigo) to the garden, where he will find ""an anointed twice-anointed one"" (capons) and ""a hundred turds of my sitting hen"" (eggs) and wine. Federigo, overhearing, collects the food and dines. Later, he and Tessa laugh about the trick.

2.  **Filostrato: Peronella.** Peronella, the beautiful wife of a poor Neapolitan mason, has a lover, Giannello Strignario. They arrange for Giannello to visit when her husband leaves for work early. One morning, Giannello is with Peronella when her husband unexpectedly returns. Peronella quickly hides Giannello in a large empty vat. She opens the door and loudly berates her husband for returning early, accusing him of laziness. He replies he returned because it's a holiday and he has sold the vat for five florins. Peronella, quick-witted, claims she has already sold it for seven florins to a man who is currently inside ""inspecting"" it. Giannello, overhearing, emerges from the vat and complains it needs cleaning. Peronella instructs her husband to clean the vat from inside. While the husband is inside, scraping, Peronella positions herself at the mouth of the vat, supposedly directing him, but actually allowing Giannello to have intercourse with her, standing on the outside. After the husband finishes cleaning, Giannello pays the seven florins and takes the vat away.

3.  **Elisa: Fra Rinaldo.** Rinaldo, a Siennese nobleman, loves his gossip (godmother) Madam Agnesa. He later becomes a friar, Fra Rinaldo, but resumes his pursuit. He persuades Agnesa that because he is less akin to her child than her husband, he may lie with her as her husband does. One day, while they are together in her bedchamber, her husband unexpectedly returns. Agnesa quickly has Fra Rinaldo dress and take her child in his arms. She opens the door, telling her husband that Fra Rinaldo, sent by God, is conjuring worms from their child, who had a sudden fainting fit. The simple husband believes her and is relieved to see his son ""cured."" Fra Rinaldo's comrade (who was teaching the maid ""paternosters"") confirms the story. The husband, grateful, entertains the friars, and the lovers continue their affair.

Ghita threatens to jump into a nearby well, claiming he will be blamed for her death. She throws a large stone into the well. Tofano, believing she has jumped, rushes out to save her. Ghita, who had hidden near the door, slips back into the house and locks him out. She then taunts him from the window. The neighbors, awakened by the commotion, blame Tofano for his drunkenness.

5.  **Fiammetta: Nicostratus and Lydia.** Nicostratus, a nobleman of Argos, has a beautiful wife, Lydia. She falls in love with Pyrrhus, her husband's trusted servant. Pyrrhus, initially cautious, eventually agrees to her advances but demands three proofs of her love: that she kill Nicostratus's favorite hawk in his presence, send him a lock of Nicostratus's beard, and one of his best teeth. Lydia, clever and determined, fulfills all three conditions through various deceptions and manipulations of her husband. For the final proof, she promises to be intimate with Pyrrhus in Nicostratus's presence, making Nicostratus believe it is not real. She makes Nicostratus and Pyrrhus go into the garden, then asks Pyrrhus to climb a pear tree for fruit. From the tree, Pyrrhus pretends to see Nicostratus and Lydia being intimate below. Nicostratus, confused, climbs the tree himself, and from that vantage point, sees Lydia and Pyrrhus being intimate below. Lydia and Pyrrhus then convince Nicostratus that the pear tree is enchanted and makes people see false things. Nicostratus, believing them, cuts down the tree, and the lovers continue their affair.

One day, at her country estate, Isabella is with Leonetto when Lambertuccio unexpectedly arrives. She quickly hides Leonetto behind her bed curtains. Lambertuccio enters and begins to be intimate with Isabella. Suddenly, her husband returns. Isabella, in a moment of quick thinking, tells Lambertuccio to draw his dagger, go downstairs, and leave angrily, shouting, ""I vow to God that I will take him elsewhere!"" Lambertuccio obeys. Her husband, seeing Lambertuccio leaving enraged, asks Isabella what happened. She fabricates a story about Lambertuccio chasing a stranger who had taken refuge in her chamber. Her husband believes her and, after finding Leonetto (who was still hiding), escorts him home to safety. The lovers continue their affair discreetly.

Beatrice leaves her chamber door open. Anichino enters. Beatrice, wanting to teach Egano a lesson about his trust, wakes him and asks him whom he trusts most among his servants. He names Anichino. She then ""reveals"" that Anichino has been trying to seduce her and plans to meet her in the garden by the pine tree. She tells Egano to go in her place, disguised in her clothes and veil, to catch him. Egano agrees. While Egano is waiting in the garden, Anichino and Beatrice make love. Afterwards, Beatrice tells Anichino to take a cudgel and go beat Egano (still in disguise) in the garden, pretending to scold him for his supposed attempt. Anichino beats Egano, who flees back to the chamber. Beatrice pretends to be amused, and Egano believes he has the most loyal wife and servant.

Ruberto pulls it to signal his arrival; if Arriguccio is asleep, she lets go; if not, she pulls it back. One night, Arriguccio feels the twine, cuts it from her toe, and ties it to his own. Ruberto pulls, and Arriguccio, believing he's caught the lover, rushes out, armed. Ruberto, seeing the door open roughly, realizes it's Arriguccio and flees. Arriguccio pursues him, and they fight. Meanwhile, Sismonda, realizing her husband's discovery, quickly replaces herself in bed with her maid, instructing her to endure any beating without revealing herself. Arriguccio returns, enraged, and beats and cuts the maid's hair, believing it to be Sismonda. He then goes to Sismonda's brothers to complain. When they arrive, Sismonda is calmly sitting, dressed, with no signs of beating or cut hair. She feigns innocence, accusing Arriguccio of drunkenness and imagining things. Her mother supports her, and the brothers reprimand Arriguccio. Sismonda, by her quick wit, not only escapes punishment but gains freedom to continue her affairs discreetly.

Lydia, the wife of Nicostratus, is in love with Pyrrhus, a servant. Her husband is very jealous. She convinces Pyrrhus to do three things to prove her love: kill Nicostratus's favorite hawk, pluck a lock of his beard, and extract one of his teeth. She achieves these by cunningly manipulating Nicostratus through feigned arguments and medical advice. Finally, to be with Pyrrhus, she convinces Nicostratus that she is ill and asks to be carried to the garden with Pyrrhus. She sends Pyrrhus up a pear tree to pick fruit. From the tree, Pyrrhus shouts that he sees Nicostratus and Lydia being intimate below. Nicostratus, perplexed, climbs the tree himself. From there, he sees Pyrrhus and Lydia below him being intimate.

Tingoccio details many, but when asked about the sin of lying with one's gossip, he says, to Meuccio's surprise, that in the other world, ""no account is taken of gossips."" Meuccio, now assured that he can pursue Mistress Mita without eternal consequence, is greatly relieved.

**Conclusion of Day the Seventh:** Dioneo's story is met with much laughter. Lauretta, as queen, passes the crown to Elisa, praising her beauty.

**Day the Eighth**

The sun rises, and the company leaves their palace for a leisurely stroll. They visit a small church, hear divine service, then return for a meal, songs, and dancing. In the afternoon, they gather by the fountain for storytelling. Neifile is chosen to begin.

**The Stories of Day the Eighth:**

1.  **Neifile: Gulfardo and Guasparruolo.** Gulfardo, a German soldier in Milan, falls in love with Madam Ambruogia, the wife of his friend, Guasparruolo Cagastraccio. She agrees to his advances only if he gives her 200 gold florins. Gulfardo, disgusted by her greed but determined to have her, devises a trick. He borrows 200 florins from Guasparruolo himself. Then, in front of his friend, he gives the money to Madam Ambruogia, telling her to give it to her husband when he returns (as if it were a repayment). She, not understanding his motive, gladly takes the money. After her husband returns, Gulfardo, in his friend's presence, reminds Guasparruolo that he returned the 200 florins to his wife. Madam Ambruogia, unable to deny it, confirms she has the money. Thus, Gulfardo enjoys her favors for free, and she is forced to give her husband the money she thought was her illicit gain.

2.  **Pamfilo: The Parish Priest of Varlungo and Belcolore.** The lusty parish priest of Varlungo is enamored of Mistress Belcolore, a lively countrywoman. He makes her small gifts (garlic, peascods). One day, he finds her husband, Bentivegna, leaving for Florence. He immediately goes to Belcolore, confessing his love. She, wary but not entirely unwilling, demands five crowns for her favors. The priest, not having the money on him, leaves his blue cloak as a pledge. They then go to the barn and make love. Later, regretting giving up his cloak, the priest devises a plan. The next day, he sends a boy to Belcolore to borrow her stone mortar. When the boy returns, he sends him back with the mortar, asking for his cloak in return. Belcolore's husband, seeing her taking a ""pledge"" from the priest, angrily orders her to return it, forbidding her from ever denying the priest anything. Belcolore, furious, grumbles but returns the cloak. The priest and Belcolore later reconcile over wine and chestnuts.

3.  **Elisa: Calandrino and the Heliotrope Stone.** Calandrino, a simple-minded painter, is tricked by his friends Bruno and Buffalmacco and Maso del Saggio. Maso tells Calandrino about the mythical land of Bengodi (where food rains down) and, more importantly, about the heliotrope stone found in the Mugnone river, which makes one invisible. Calandrino, eager to become rich by stealing, enthusiastically recruits Bruno and Buffalmacco to help him search. They agree to go on a holiday morning. Calandrino, rushing ahead, collects every black stone he finds, filling his pockets and cloak. Bruno and Buffalmacco, feigning that they cannot see him (as the stone has made him invisible), begin to pelt him with stones, pretending he isn't there. Calandrino believes the stone is working and, laden with stones, returns home, enduring the pelting. His wife, Tessa, sees him and berates him for being late. Calandrino, furious that his wife can see him (thus negating the stone's power), beats her severely, blaming her for ruining his invisibility. Bruno and Buffalmacco arrive, pretend to be surprised, and then explain to Calandrino that women cause things to lose their virtue, and his wife's presence ruined the spell. They also blame him for not warning his wife to stay inside.

4.  **Emilia: The Rector of Fiesole and Piccarda.** The arrogant, old, and lecherous Rector of Fiesole falls in love with Madam Piccarda, a noble and discreet widow. He relentlessly pursues her, despite her polite rejections. Piccarda, with her brothers' consent, decides to teach him a lesson. She feigns a change of heart and agrees to meet him, but only in her chamber, in the dark, and in complete silence, because her brothers sleep nearby. Piccarda then dresses her ugly maid, Ciutazza, and puts her in her bed, instructing her to remain silent and embrace the rector. The rector arrives, enters the dark chamber, and makes love to Ciutazza, believing it to be Piccarda. Meanwhile, Piccarda's brothers, with the Bishop of Florence (who was visiting them), enter the chamber with lights. They discover the rector in bed with Ciutazza. The rector is shamed and exposed. The Bishop, disgusted, scolds him and sends him away under guard. The rector is forced to do penance and is forever mocked by the children of Fiesole.

5.  **Filostrato: Three Young Men and the Marchegan Judge.** Maso del Saggio, Ribi, and Matteuzzo, three mischievous Florentine youths, decide to humiliate a crude, avaricious Marchegan judge named Messer Niccola da San Lepidio, who is serving as Provost. They notice his ill-fitting, low-hanging breeches. They plan a prank: Matteuzzo hides under the judge's bench. Maso and Ribi approach the judge during a busy court session, each loudly making a contradictory complaint about a stolen item. As the judge leans forward to hear them, Matteuzzo, from below, pulls down Messer Niccola's breeches. Maso and Ribi continue their shouting, holding the judge's gown, ensuring everyone sees his humiliation. Matteuzzo then escapes. The judge, mortified, pulls up his breeches. The Provost, his superior, is later informed and, understanding the underlying criticism of the incompetent judges he brought, decides to let the matter drop.

6.  **Filomena: Bruno and Buffalmacco and Calandrino's Pig.** Calandrino owns a pig. Bruno and Buffalmacco, with a friendly priest, decide to steal it. They get Calandrino drunk at the tavern, and he leaves his door open. They steal the pig and take it to the priest's house. The next morning, Calandrino discovers the theft and laments. Bruno and Buffalmacco pretend to sympathize and suggest using a ""bread and cheese ordeal"" to find the thief among his neighbors. Bruno, instead, proposes a ""ginger bolus ordeal"" with wine, as it's more subtle. Calandrino pays for the ingredients. Bruno buys ginger boluses and two dog-balls made with bitter aloes, covered in sugar, marking them secretly. At the gathering, Bruno explains that the thief will find the bolus bitter and spit it out. He gives Calandrino one of the bitter aloes balls. Calandrino, tasting the bitterness, spits it out. Bruno gives him another, which he also spits out after much effort. Everyone present concludes Calandrino stole his own pig. Bruno and Buffalmacco then extort two pairs of capons from Calandrino to keep the ""secret"" from his wife.

7.  **Pampinea: Rinieri and Elena.** Rinieri, a Florentine scholar returning from Paris, falls deeply in love with Elena, a proud and beautiful widow. Elena, flattered by his attention, leads him on with false promises and messages through her maid, making him believe she loves him. To test his patience and amuse her actual lover, she arranges for Rinieri to wait in her snowy courtyard all night on Christmas Eve, promising to join him after her ""brother"" (her lover, whom she is entertaining) leaves. Rinieri, freezing, overhears Elena and her lover making fun of him. His love turns to fierce hatred, and he vows revenge. When Elena's lover later abandons her, her maid suggests asking Rinieri, a supposed necromancer, to win him back. Rinieri agrees and instructs Elena to perform a ritual: bathe naked seven times in a river with a pewter image, then climb an uninhabited tower and recite words towards the north. Rinieri hides near the tower. Elena, naked, performs the ritual. Rinieri secretly removes the ladder, trapping her on the tower. He then confronts her, revealing his identity and gloating over his revenge, leaving her exposed to the sun, flies, and thirst all day. Elena, suffering terribly, begs for mercy. Rinieri, after much torment, finally allows her to be rescued. She and her maid suffer injuries. Elena, cured of her pride, abandons love and mockery.

8.  **Fiammetta: Spinelloccio and Zeppa.** Spinelloccio Tanena and Zeppa di Mino, two close Siennese friends, are neighbors. Spinelloccio is having an affair with Zeppa's wife. Zeppa discovers them kissing and embracing. Instead of confronting them, he devises a calm revenge. He tells his wife to invite Spinelloccio to her bedchamber the next day, and when he returns, to hide Spinelloccio in a chest. The wife complies. Zeppa then invites Spinelloccio's wife to dine, claiming Spinelloccio is out. He then takes her into his bedchamber, locks the door, and, revealing that Spinelloccio is in the chest, makes love to her on top of the chest. Spinelloccio, trapped inside, overhears and feels everything, realizing he has been outwitted. After their intimacy, Zeppa shows Spinelloccio's wife her husband in the chest, revealing the reciprocal trick. Spinelloccio emerges, declaring them ""quits"" and proposing they share their wives, which they all agree to, living in harmony.

9.  **Elisa: Master Simone the Physician.** Master Simone, a vain and dull-witted doctor from Bologna, desires to join Bruno and Buffalmacco's ""merry company,"" believing they have secret ways of acquiring wealth. Bruno tells him a fabricated story of a necromantic society that meets twice a month, where they enjoy lavish feasts and beautiful women (Queens and Empresses from all over the world). He promises to introduce Master Simone. To gain entry, Master Simone must prove his courage by meeting a ""black horned beast"" (Buffalmacco in disguise) on a tomb at Santa Maria Novella. He must mount the beast and make no mention of God or saints. If he shows fear, he will be cast into ""some place where you are like to stink for it."" Master Simone, eager for glory and women, agrees, boasting of his bravery. He dresses in his scarlet doctor's gown and waits on the tomb. Buffalmacco, disguised as a horned beast, appears, whistles, howls, and capers to scare him. Master Simone, terrified but driven by desire, mounts the ""beast."" Buffalmacco then takes him to a trench filled with ordure (jakes emptied for manure) and pitches him headfirst into it. Bruno and Buffalmacco watch him struggle and flee. Master Simone, covered in filth, returns home to his wife's furious reproaches. The painters then appear, feigning anger, and show him fake bruises, blaming him for breaking the rules and endangering them. Master Simone, utterly humiliated and smelling foul, is forced to entertain them lavishly to keep the secret.

10. **Dioneo: Salabaetto and Biancofiore.** Salabaetto, a Florentine merchant in Palermo, is seduced by Biancofiore, a cunning courtesan who extorts 500 gold florins from him by feigning a family emergency. Salabaetto, realizing he's been duped, seeks advice from his friend Canigiano in Naples. Canigiano helps him devise a counter-trick. Salabaetto returns to Palermo, pretending to have much richer merchandise (casks of seawater with a thin layer of oil, bales of tow with only two real cloths). Biancofiore, hearing of his supposed new wealth, regrets her previous small gain and decides to try to get more. She sends for Salabaetto and, feigning renewed love, offers to lend him 1000 florins to save his ""new"" merchandise from corsairs, demanding his new goods as security. Salabaetto agrees, but insists on keeping the keys to the warehouse. He takes the 1000 florins and returns to Naples. Biancofiore later discovers the ""merchandise"" is worthless. Salabaetto, having recouped his loss and profited, abandons trade and moves to Ferrara, leaving Biancofiore to lament being outwitted.

**Conclusion of Day the Eighth:** Dioneo's story entertains the company. Lauretta passes the crown to Emilia, praising her beauty.

Both men, driven by love, agree. Alessandro, full of fear and misgivings, enters the tomb and dresses in Scannadio's clothes. Rinuccio, also fearful, arrives and carries the disguised Alessandro on his shoulders towards Francesca's house. The city watch intercepts them. Rinuccio drops Alessandro and flees.

In her rush, she grabs the priest's breeches instead of her coif and puts them on her head. The nuns, focused on Isabetta's transgression, fail to notice. They break into Isabetta's cell and find her with her lover. The Abbess, furious, begins to scold Isabetta severely. Isabetta, noticing the breeches on the Abbess's head, calmly tells her to ""tie up her coif."" The other nuns and the Abbess realize her mistake and public humiliation.

Master Simone ""diagnoses"" Calandrino as pregnant, claiming it's due to his wife Tessa's habit of always being ""uppermost"" during sex. Calandrino, horrified, believes it and blames his wife. He offers his entire inheritance to the doctor to be ""cured"" without ""giving birth."" The doctor prescribes a ""ptisan"" (a clary) and demands three pairs of fat capons and five crowns for other ingredients. Calandrino pays Bruno to buy these. Bruno, Buffalmacco, and the doctor enjoy the capons and money. Calandrino drinks the ""ptisan,"" and after three days, the doctor declares him ""cured.""

Ruggieri serves well but is not rewarded with land or titles, unlike others he deems less worthy. He feels slighted and asks leave to depart. King Alfonso grants it and gives him a fine mule. The King secretly sends a discreet servant to accompany Ruggieri and report anything he says. On the journey, Ruggieri's mule refuses to urinate. Later, at a river, it urinates freely. Ruggieri comments that the mule is like the King, giving where it shouldn't and not where it should. The servant reports this. The King summons Ruggieri, who frankly explains his criticism. King Alfonso explains that his lack of reward for Ruggieri is due to Ruggieri's ""perverse fortune,"" not his own will. To prove this, he offers Ruggieri a choice between two locked coffers: one with his crown and jewels, the other with earth. Ruggieri chooses the earth-filled coffer. The King, laughing, demonstrates Ruggieri's ill fortune but then, overcoming fortune's power, gives him the coffer of jewels, allowing him to return to Tuscany enriched.

The Abbot, initially furious, is persuaded by Ghino's messenger that resistance is futile. At the castle, Ghino lodges the Abbot in a dark, small room, isolated from his retinue and possessions. He then visits the Abbot, learns of his ailment, and devises a ""cure"" without baths. For several days, Ghino brings the Abbot only two slices of toasted bread and a glass of wine, twice a day. The Abbot's stomach improves. Ghino then asks how he feels. The Abbot says he'd be fine if out of Ghino's hands. Ghino then reveals himself, moves the Abbot to a comfortable room, and hosts a magnificent banquet with the Abbot's retinue. Ghino, demonstrating his generosity, allows the Abbot to choose how much of his possessions to take back. The Abbot, impressed by Ghino's magnanimity, takes only a few necessities, leaving the rest. He returns to Rome and asks the Pope to pardon Ghino, praising his character. The Pope, a lover of worthy men, grants the pardon, makes Ghino a Knight of the Hospitallers, and gives him a grand priory, which Ghino serves loyally.

3.  **Filostrato: Mithridanes and Nathan.** Nathan, a noble and wealthy man in Cattajo, is renowned for his boundless hospitality. He builds a magnificent palace on a highway, entertaining all travelers. Mithridanes, a young nobleman from a neighboring country, envies Nathan's fame and seeks to surpass him in generosity. He builds an even grander palace. One day, an old woman tells Mithridanes that Nathan's generosity is so great, he doesn't recognize repeated beggars, always giving alms. Mithridanes, however, recognized her after only 12 requests. Mithridanes, feeling he can't match Nathan in generosity, resolves to kill him, believing Nathan's death will make him the most generous. He travels to Nathan's palace and, not recognizing Nathan (who is walking alone in his garden, humbly dressed), asks him where Nathan lives. Nathan, still disguised, offers to lead him there and ensures Mithridanes is not recognized by anyone in his palace. Mithridanes, believing Nathan's servant is giving him advice, reveals his plan to kill Nathan. Nathan, understanding, calmly advises Mithridanes on the best place and time to ambush him (a coppice where Nathan walks alone). The next morning, Nathan goes to the coppice to meet his death. Mithridanes finds him and, ready to strike, is overcome by Nathan's calm acceptance and wise words. He recognizes Nathan, casts away his sword, and begs forgiveness, filled with shame. Nathan, forgiving him, explains he would rather give his life generously than have it taken by nature. Mithridanes, cured of his envy, becomes Nathan's friend, and Nathan teaches him how to truly be magnificent.

4.  **Lauretta: Messer Gentile de' Carisendi.** Messer Gentile Carisendi, a noble Bolognese gentleman, is deeply in love with Madam Catalina, wife of Niccoluccio Caccianimico, but his love is unrequited. He leaves Bologna in despair. Meanwhile, Catalina, pregnant, falls gravely ill and is believed dead. She is buried in a tomb. Gentile, hearing of her death, resolves to visit her tomb and kiss her one last time. He secretly exhumes her. As he kisses her, he feels a faint heartbeat and realizes she is not dead. He takes her to his mother's house in Bologna. His mother, a discreet woman, nurses Catalina back to health. Catalina gives birth to a son. Gentile treats her honorably, as a sister. When he returns to Modona, he plans a grand banquet, inviting many noblemen, including Niccoluccio. At the banquet, Gentile poses a moral dilemma: if a master abandons a sick servant, and a stranger cures him, who has the right to the servant? Niccoluccio, speaking for all, declares the stranger has the right. Gentile then reveals Catalina, alive and beautiful, with her infant son. He states that he, as the rescuer, has the right to keep her, but magnanimously returns her and her son to Niccoluccio, attesting to her chastity while in his care. Niccoluccio, overjoyed, accepts them, and Gentile is praised for his immense generosity.

5.  **Emilia: Madam Dianora.** Madam Dianora, a noble and beautiful lady of Udine, is loved by Messer Ansaldo Gradense, a valiant knight. She rejects his advances. To deter him, she sets an impossible condition: he must present her with a garden as fair in January as in May. Ansaldo, desperate, hires a nigromancer (magician) to create such a garden. The magician succeeds. Dianora, seeing the miraculous garden, is dismayed, realizing she must fulfill her promise. She confesses her predicament to her husband, Gilberto. Gilberto, though angry, is more impressed by her honesty and Ansaldo's extreme efforts. He generously tells her to go to Ansaldo and fulfill her promise, but to preserve her chastity if possible. Dianora, with her servants, goes to Ansaldo. Ansaldo, upon hearing of Gilberto's magnanimity, is so moved that his lust turns to compassion. He releases Dianora from her promise, declaring he would not dishonor such a noble husband. The nigromancer, witnessing this mutual generosity, also refuses his fee, declaring it would be wrong to profit from such virtue. All three demonstrate extraordinary generosity.

6.  **Fiammetta: King Charles the Old.** King Charles I of Naples, after his victory over King Manfred, falls in love with Ginevra the Fair, daughter of Messer Neri degli Uberti, a Florentine Ghibelline exiled by Charles. King Charles visits Neri's garden, where he sees Ginevra and her sister, Isotta, fishing in a pond, scantily clad. He is captivated by their beauty. He consults with Count Guy de Montfort, who rebukes him, reminding him of his royal honor and the injustice of taking a nobleman's daughters who had hosted him. King Charles, chastened, overcomes his lust. To honor Neri's hospitality and protect the girls' honor, he arranges for both daughters to be magnificently dowered and married to noble knights (Messer Maffeo da Palizzi and Messer Guglielmo della Magna) as if they were his own daughters. He sends them to Apulia to mortify his desires, demonstrating his self-conquest and kingly magnanimity.

7.  **Pampinea: King Pedro of Arragon.** Lisa, the beautiful daughter of a rich apothecary in Palermo, falls deeply in love with King Pedro of Aragon after seeing him tilt at a festival. She pines away from unrequited love, falling gravely ill. Her father, Bernardo Puccini, offers her anything to make her well. She asks for Minuccio d'Arezzo, a skilled musician. She confesses her secret love and despair to Minuccio, asking him to inform the King. Minuccio, moved, composes a plaintive love song about her passion and sings it to King Pedro. The King, intrigued, summons Minuccio, who relates Lisa's story. King Pedro, a debonair and generous prince, visits Lisa, comforts her, and encourages her recovery. Lisa recovers and becomes even more beautiful. The King, consulting the Queen, decides to honor Lisa's love. He arranges for her to marry a noble but poor young man, Perdicone, and dower them richly. At the wedding, King Pedro declares himself Lisa's knight and gives her a kiss on the brow, promising to wear her favor in all deeds of arms.

8.  **Filomena: Titus Quintius Fulvus and Gisippus.** Titus Quintius Fulvus and Gisippus, a Roman and an Athenian, develop an extraordinary friendship while studying philosophy in Athens. Gisippus is betrothed to the beautiful Sophronia. Titus, upon seeing Sophronia, falls desperately in love with her but struggles with his loyalty to Gisippus. He falls ill. Gisippus, discerning the cause of Titus's illness, magnanimously offers Sophronia to him. Titus, ashamed, initially refuses, but Gisippus insists, arguing that true friendship is more precious than a wife. They devise a plan: Gisippus will go through with the wedding, but Titus will secretly take his place in the marriage bed. This is done, and Sophronia is secretly married to Titus.
    Later, Titus's father dies, requiring his return to Rome. Titus takes Sophronia with him, revealing the truth to her. Sophronia, enraged, complains to her family, causing a scandal. Titus confronts the angry Athenian families, eloquently defending Gisippus's actions as an act of true friendship and explaining the predestined nature of love. He challenges them to prove him wrong, and threatens them with Roman power if they pursue the matter. The Athenians, swayed by his arguments and threats, agree to the marriage.
    Years later, Gisippus loses his fortune and is exiled from Athens. He travels to Rome in poverty, seeking Titus. Titus, initially failing to recognize him in his wretched state, passes him by. Gisippus, despairing, decides to die by falsely confessing to a murder he witnesses. Titus, discovering his friend's plight, publicly confesses to the same murder to save Gisippus. The true murderer, Publius Ambustus, moved by their friendship, also confesses. Octavianus (later Augustus), hearing their story, frees all three. Titus embraces Gisippus, reproaches him for his diffidence, shares all his wealth with him, and gives him his sister Fulvia in marriage. The two friends and their wives live together in Rome in enduring friendship and happiness.

9.  **Pamfilo: Messer Torello.** During a crusade, Saladin, disguised as a merchant, travels through Lombardy to observe Christian preparations. He encounters Messer Torello d'Istria, a magnificently generous gentleman of Pavia, who insists on hosting Saladin and his two companions. Torello, discerning their noble status, sends a servant ahead to his wife, who, with a ""royal spirit,"" prepares a grand banquet and invites the noblest citizens. The next day, Torello guides Saladin to Pavia, leading him not to an inn, but to his own house, where a splendid reception awaits. Saladin is deeply impressed by Torello's magnificent hospitality and his wife's beauty and grace. Torello's wife, not recognizing Saladin, gives him sumptuous clothes. Saladin and Torello part ways, with Saladin promising to repay Torello's kindness.
    Torello later joins the crusade and is captured by Saladin's forces in Alexandria. Unknown, he becomes Saladin's falconer, a skill he excels in. A false rumor of Torello's death reaches Pavia, and his wife, after mourning and a year's grace, is pressured to remarry.
    Saladin, recognizing Torello by a unique smile, reveals his identity. Torello, overjoyed, recounts his story. Saladin, moved by Torello's predicament (his wife's impending remarriage), arranges for a nigromancer to transport Torello, asleep on a magnificent bed adorned with treasures, in one night to Pavia. Torello awakens in his uncle's church in Pavia on the morning of his wife's new wedding. He learns his wife is about to marry another. Torello, still disguised, attends the wedding feast with his uncle (the Abbot). He puts a ring (given by his wife when he left for the crusade) into a cup of wine and has it served to his wife. She finds the ring, recognizes it, and immediately recognizes Torello. Overjoyed, she overthrows the table and embraces him. Torello recounts his adventures. The new bridegroom magnanimously yields his claim. Torello is reunited with his wife and family, and his return is celebrated with immense joy. He lives out his days in greater hospitality and honor.

10. **Dioneo: The Marquess of Saluzzo and Griselda.** Gualtieri, Marquess of Saluzzo, is pressured by his vassals to marry and produce an heir. He agrees but insists on choosing his own wife. He chooses Griselda, a poor but beautiful and virtuous peasant girl from a nearby village. His vassals agree to honor whomever he chooses. Gualtieri publicly marries Griselda, stripping her of her peasant clothes and dressing her in magnificent attire. Griselda quickly proves herself to be an exemplary wife and a wise, gracious lady, earning the love and respect of all his subjects.
    Gualtieri then begins a series of cruel tests of Griselda's patience. First, when she gives birth to a daughter, he pretends that his vassals are discontented with her low birth and demand the child's death. Griselda, without a change of expression, surrenders the child. Gualtieri secretly sends the child to Bologna to be raised. Two years later, Griselda gives birth to a son. Gualtieri repeats the same cruel charade, taking the son and sending him away, making her believe he too is dead. Griselda endures all with unwavering patience and obedience.
    After twelve years, Gualtieri announces his intention to divorce Griselda and marry a new, nobler wife, claiming he has a papal dispensation. He sends Griselda back to her father's home, in her shift, taking nothing but her chastity. Griselda, though heartbroken, accepts her fate with dignity and returns to her humble life.
    Gualtieri then sends for Griselda to return to his palace, ostensibly to prepare for his new wedding, ordering her to serve as a scullery maid and arrange the feast. She does so diligently and courteously, despite her rags and the profound grief she hides. Gualtieri then brings his ""new bride"" to the palace, accompanied by a retinue. This ""bride"" is actually his own daughter, now twelve, and her younger brother, returning from Bologna. Griselda, still serving, praises the new bride's beauty.
    Finally, Gualtieri reveals the truth: the ""bride"" and her brother are their children, whom he never killed. He praises Griselda's extraordinary patience and virtue, reclaims her as his wife, and restores her to her rightful place as Marchioness, now dearer to him than ever. The children are returned to her, and a joyous celebration ensues. Everyone, including the vassals, praises Griselda's wisdom and endurance, though they find Gualtieri's tests excessively harsh.

**Conclusion of Day the Tenth:** Dioneo's story is much discussed. Pamfilo, acknowledging the end of his reign and their fifteen days away from Florence, proposes they return home the next morning. He commends the group's decorum and harmony throughout their stay. The company agrees. After a final supper, dancing, and singing, Fiammetta sings a song about the torments of jealousy. As the new day dawns, they return to Florence, where the three young men take leave of the seven ladies in Santa Maria Novella.

**Conclusion of the Author:** The author concludes his work, thanking God and his audience. He addresses potential criticisms:
*   **Too much license/unseemly stories:** He defends his choice by stating that the nature of the stories required it, he expressed them ""seemly terms,"" and writers should have as much liberty as painters. He also notes the context: these stories were told in a garden among young, witty people seeking diversion during a time of crisis, where even the ""most virtuous"" had to bend rules for survival. He argues that stories, like anything else, can be used for good or ill depending on the reader's disposition, and that well-disposed minds will not be corrupted.
*   **Some stories are not good enough:** He argues he could only write what was told to him, and that no human craftsman (save God) creates everything perfectly. Even great works have imperfections, and a large collection will naturally have variety. He wrote for ""simple lasses"" and those seeking to ""pass away time,"" not scholars, so he avoided overly refined language.
*   **Some stories are too long:** He reiterates that he wrote for idle women, for whom nothing is too long if it serves to pass time.
*   **Full of quips and cranks/unsuitable for a man of gravity:** He humorously accepts being a ""man of weight,"" but claims he is ""light"" like a nutgall in water. He notes that even friars' sermons are full of ""quips and cranks"" to rebuke sin, so his use of them for diversion is acceptable.
*   **Ill tongue towards friars:** He admits writing the truth about friars, acknowledging they are ""good sort of folk"" who avoid discomfort and are greedy, but whose ""commerce would be far more agreeable"" if they didn't ""savor somewhat of the buck-goat."" He asserts that his tongue has been judged ""the best and sweetest in the world"" by a neighbor.

He concludes by leaving readers to their own judgment and thanks God for bringing the work to its desired end, wishing peace and favor upon his ""charming ladies."""

**THE DIVINE COMEDY: Plot Summary**

The narrative begins with the unnamed protagonist, in the midway of his mortal life, finding himself lost in a ""gloomy wood,"" having strayed from the ""path direct."" The forest is savage, wild, robust, and rough, filling him with dismay ""in bitterness not far from death."" He scarcely remembers how he entered, due to a ""sleepy dullness."" He eventually reaches a mountain's foot and looks up to see its shoulders ""already vested with that planet's beam, who leads all wanderers safe through every way,"" which brings him a brief respite from fear.

As he begins to ascend the ""lonely steep,"" a ""panther, nimble, light, and cover'd with a speckled skin,"" appears, blocking his way and making him consider turning back. The time is morning's prime, with the sun ascending, filling the protagonist with ""joyous hope."" However, this joy is quickly replaced by new dread when a ""lion came, 'gainst me, as it appear'd, with his head held aloft and hunger-mad,"" striking fear even in the air. At the lion's heels follows a ""she-wolf,"" described as full of all wants and having made many lands desolate. The sight of the she-wolf so overwhelms the protagonist with fear that he loses all hope of ascending the height and is gradually driven back ""where the sun in silence rests.""

**HELL (OR THE INFERNO)**

**CANTO I**
As the protagonist falls backward, he discerns the form of someone whose voice seems faint from disuse. He cries out, ""Have mercy on me! Spirit! or living man! what e'er thou be!"" The figure replies that he was once a man, born of Lombard parents in Mantua, and lived in Rome under Augustus. He identifies himself as a bard who sang of ""Anchises' upright son."" He asks the protagonist why he returns to such perils instead of ascending the ""pleasant mount.""
The protagonist, abashed, recognizes the figure as Virgil, the ""well-spring"" of eloquence and ""glory and light of all the tuneful train."" He expresses his long zeal for Virgil's works and calls him his ""master and guide,"" attributing his own fame-exalting style to him. He then pleads with Virgil to save him from the beast (the she-wolf) that has made him tremble.
Virgil tells him that he ""must needs another way pursue"" to escape the wilderness, as the beast will not suffer anyone to pass and makes ""no less hindrance than death."" He describes the beast as ""so bad and so accursed"" that her ravenous will is never sated. He prophesies the coming of a ""greyhound"" who will destroy her, one who lives ""by love, wisdom, and virtue"" and whose land will be ""'twixt either Feltro."" This greyhound will bring safety to Italia's plains and worry the beast until he restores her to hell, whence she was first let loose by envy.
For the protagonist's benefit, Virgil devises a plan: the protagonist is to follow him through an ""eternal space"" where he will hear ""despairing shrieks"" and see ""Spirits of old tormented,"" who ""invoke a second death."" Next, he will see those who ""dwell content in fire,"" hoping to come ""among the blest."" If the protagonist desires to ascend to those regions, a ""spirit worthier than I"" must lead him, as Virgil is judged a ""rebel to his law"" by the ""Almighty King"" and thus cannot enter His city.
The protagonist, begging Virgil by the God he did not adore, beseeches him to lead him to ""Saint Peter's gate"" and to see those in ""dismal plight."" Virgil then moves onward, and the protagonist closely pursues his steps.

**CANTO II**
As day departs and shadows darken the air, releasing all animals from toil, the protagonist alone prepares for the ""conflict to sustain, both of sad pity, and that perilous road."" He invokes the Muses and his genius for aid.
He expresses doubt to Virgil, asking if he possesses sufficient virtue for such a ""high enterprise."" He recalls that Aeneas (Silvius' sire), while still in corruptible flesh, had entrance among ""th' immortal tribes,"" an act deserved due to his destined role as father of Rome and its empire, established for the holy place of Peter's successor. He also mentions ""the chosen vessel"" (Paul) who traveled there to bring assurance of faith. But the protagonist questions his own worthiness, fearing his venture will end in folly.
Virgil, perceiving the protagonist's ""vile fear,"" reassures him. He explains his presence by recounting an encounter in ""Limbo"" with a ""dame, so blest and lovely"" named Beatrice. Her eyes were brighter than the sun, and she spoke with a gentle, angelic voice. Beatrice told Virgil that a friend (the protagonist), ""not of my fortune but myself,"" had met great hindrance and turned back through fear. She expressed dread that he might be lost past help and that she had risen too late for his relief, having heard of him in heaven. She commanded Virgil to assist him with his ""eloquent persuasive tongue"" and by all other means. Beatrice, who comes from a place ""revisited with joy"" and is prompted by Love, promised to tell her Master (God) of Virgil's praise.
The protagonist, delighted by her command, asks Beatrice why she is not ""loth to leave that ample space, where to return thou burnest, for this centre here beneath."" She explains that only things from which evil may proceed are to be feared. She is ""so fram'd by God"" that the misery of Hell does not touch her, nor does its fire assail her. She reveals that a ""blessed dame"" in high heaven (implied to be Mary or Lucia) grieves for the protagonist's hindrance and inclines ""God's stern judgment to her will."" This dame called Lucia, who is ""of all cruelty the foe,"" sped to Beatrice while she was seated with Rachel. Lucia urged Beatrice to succor the protagonist, who loved her so much, and not to ignore his pitiful wail and the ""death, which in the torrent flood, swoln mightier than a sea, him struggling holds."" Beatrice, trusting in Virgil's eloquence, then came down.
Hearing this, the protagonist's fainting vigor is restored, and he feels ""kindly courage."" He declares his ""first purpose fully is resum'd"" and is ready to be led by Virgil, his ""guide, master, and lord."" They then enter the ""deep and woody way.""

**CANTO III**
They arrive at a portal with a dim inscription: ""Through me you pass into the city of woe: Through me you pass into eternal pain: Through me among the people lost for aye. Justice the founder of my fabric mov'd: To rear me was the task of power divine, Supremest wisdom, and primeval love. Before me things create were none, save things Eternal, and eternal I endure. All hope abandon ye who enter here.""
The protagonist finds these words ""hard meaning,"" but Virgil instructs him to leave ""all distrust"" and extinguish ""vile fear,"" as they are about to see souls ""to misery doom'd, who intellectual good have lost."" Virgil takes his hand and leads him into the ""secret place.""
Inside, sighs, lamentations, and loud moans echo through the starless air. Various horrible languages, outcries of woe, accents of anger, and deep, hoarse voices, with hands smiting together, create a tumult that whirls ""through that air with solid darkness stain'd, like to the sand that in the whirlwind flies."" The protagonist, still encompassed by error, asks who these sorrowful people are.
Virgil explains they are the ""wretched souls of those, who liv'd without or praise or blame,"" mixed with an ""ill band of angels"" who were neither rebellious nor true to God, but ""for themselves were only."" Heaven drove them out to preserve its lustre, and Hell does not receive them, ""lest th' accursed tribe should glory thence with exultation vain."" They have no hope of death, and their ""blind life so meanly passes"" that they envy all other lots. Fame, mercy, and justice scorn them. Virgil advises to ""Speak not of them, but look, and pass them by.""
The protagonist then sees a rapidly whirling flag, followed by a long train of spirits, so numerous he ""should ne'er have thought, that death so many had despoil'd."" He recognizes one shade ""who to base fear yielding, abjur'd his high estate."" He understands this to be the tribe displeasing to both God and His foes. These naked wretches are stung by wasps and hornets, their cheeks bedewed with blood mixed with tears that drip to their feet and are gathered by ""disgustful worms.""
Looking further, he sees a throng on the shore of a great stream. He asks Virgil who they are and why they are so eager to cross. Virgil replies they will know when they reach the ""woeful tide of Acheron."" The protagonist, casting his eyes downward in shame, abstains from speech until they reach the river.
An old man, hoary white with age, approaches in a bark, crying, ""Woe to you wicked spirits! hope not ever to see the sky again. I come to take you to the other shore across, into eternal darkness, there to dwell in fierce heat and in ice."" He tells the protagonist, a ""live spirit,"" to leave the dead. But seeing the protagonist remain, he says, ""By other way, by other haven shalt thou come to shore, not by this passage; thee a nimbler boat must carry."" Virgil intervenes, telling Charon (the boatman with eyes like ""wheeling flames"") not to torment himself, as ""so 'tis will'd, where will and power are one."" Charon, silent, falls into silence.
The faint and naked spirits, hearing these cruel words, change color and gnash their teeth, blaspheming God, their parents, mankind, the place, the time, and their birth. They then all wailing draw to the ""curs'd strand."" Charon, a ""demoniac form,"" beckons them, striking any who linger with his oar. Like autumn leaves falling, Adam's evil brood cast themselves one by one from the shore into the ""umber'd wave.""
Virgil explains that ""those, who die subject to the wrath of God,"" come here from every clime and are eager to cross because ""heaven's justice goads them on, that fear is turn'd into desire."" He notes that no good spirit ever passes here, which explains Charon's complaint about the protagonist.
As Virgil finishes speaking, the gloomy region shakes terribly, chilling the protagonist with clammy dews. The earth emits a blast and a ""vermilion flame,"" conquering his senses, and he drops ""as one with sudden slumber seiz'd.""

**CANTO IV**
A crash of heavy thunder breaks the protagonist's deep slumber, rousing him. He looks around, finding himself on the brink of a ""lamentable vale,"" a ""dread abyss"" with a thundering sound of innumerable plaints. It is dark, deep, and thick with clouds, and he cannot discern its bottom.
Virgil, looking pale, bids them descend to the ""blind world"" beneath, leading the way. The protagonist, noticing Virgil's pallor, asks how he can proceed if his guide yields to dread. Virgil explains that his pallor is from pity for the suffering souls below, not fear, and urges haste.
They enter the ""first circle, that surrounds th' abyss."" Here, only sighs are heard, not from tortures, but from grief felt by vast multitudes of ""men, women, and infants."" Virgil explains these spirits are ""blameless"" of sin, but are lost because ""baptism was not theirs,"" the ""portal to thy faith."" Those who lived before the Gospel ""serv'd not God aright,"" and Virgil himself is among them. Their affliction is ""only so far afflicted, that we live desiring without hope.""
The protagonist feels grief, knowing many souls ""of mighty worth"" are suspended in this ""Limbo."" He asks Virgil if any, by their own or others' merit, ever came forth from there to be blessed.
Virgil, understanding, replies that he was ""new to that estate"" when he saw a ""puissant one arrive amongst us, with victorious trophy crown'd."" This figure drew forth the shades of Adam, Abel, Noah, Moses, Abraham, David, Israel and his family (including Rachel), and ""others many more,"" exalting them to bliss. Before these, ""no spirit of human kind was ever sav'd.""
They continue through the ""wood"" of spirits. Not far from a summit, the protagonist sees a flame shining through the darkened hemisphere. He discerns a ""tribe in honour high"" possessing that place. He asks Virgil who these honored souls are, separate from the rest. Virgil replies that their ""renown of their great names"" in the upper world acquires ""favour in heaven,"" advancing them.
A voice calls out, ""Honour the bard sublime! his shade returns that left us late!"" Four mighty spirits approach, neither sorrowful nor glad. Virgil identifies the one bearing a ""falchion keen"" as Homer, followed by Flaccus (Horace), Naso (Ovid), and Lucan. He explains they greet him thus because they all share the appellation of ""bard sublime.""
The protagonist finds himself admitted to this ""bright school"" of poets, becoming ""sixth amid so learn'd a band."" They pass on, speaking of matters ""then befitting well to speak, now fitter left untold."" They arrive at a magnificent castle, ""seven times with lofty walls begirt,"" and defended by a ""pleasant stream,"" which they cross as if on dry land. Through ""seven gates,"" the protagonist enters with the sages into a ""mead with lively verdure fresh.""
Here dwell a race moving their eyes ""majestically,"" bearing ""eminent authority,"" and speaking seldom, but with ""tuneful sweet"" words. They retire to an ""open and bright and lofty"" place, where the protagonist sees ""great spirits,"" by whose sight he is ""exalted in my own esteem."" He sees Electra, Hector, Anchises' son (Aeneas), Caesar (all armed), Camilla, Penthesilea, old King Latinus with his child Lavinia, Brutus (who chased Tarquin), Lucretia, Cato's wife Marcia, Julia, and Cornelia. Apart, he sees the ""Soldan fierce.""
Raising his brow, he spies ""the master of the sapient throng,"" seated amid philosophers. All admire and reverence him. He marks Socrates and Plato nearest to him, then Democritus, Diogenes, Heraclitus, Empedocles, Anaxagoras, Thales, Zeno, Dioscorides, Orpheus, Linus, Tully (Cicero), Seneca, Euclid, Ptolemy, Hippocrates, Galen, Avicenna, and Averroes.
To speak of all fully would be vain, as his theme urges him onward. The six associates part, and Virgil leads the protagonist from that ""air serene, into a climate ever vex'd with storms,"" arriving at a place where ""no light shines.""

**CANTO V**
The protagonist descends from the first circle to the second, a lesser space containing ""so much more of grief provoking bitter moans."" Here, Minos stands, ""grinning with ghastly feature,"" examining crimes and giving sentence by encircling himself with his tail as many times as the degrees the soul must descend into Hell. Souls confess all before him, and he, ""judge severe of sins,"" determines their place. A numerous throng always stands before him, each awaiting judgment.
Minos, seeing the protagonist approach, cries out, ""O thou! who to this residence of woe approachest? Look how thou enter here; beware in whom thou place thy trust; let not the entrance broad deceive thee to thy harm."" Virgil silences him, stating, ""Wherefore exclaimest? Hinder not his way by destiny appointed; so 'tis will'd where will and power are one.""
Rueful wailings begin to be heard as they enter a place where ""light was silent all."" A bellowing noise, like a sea in tempest, groans through the air. The ""stormy blast of hell with restless fury drives the spirits on, whirl'd round and dash'd amain with sore annoy."" At the ""ruinous sweep,"" shrieks, lamentations, moans, and blasphemies ""gainst the good Power in heaven"" are heard.
The protagonist understands that ""carnal sinners, in whom reason by lust is sway'd,"" are condemned to this torment. Like starlings borne abroad by winter winds, or cranes chanting dolorous notes, these evil souls are driven relentlessly by the ""tyrannous gust,"" with no hope of rest or milder pang.
He asks Virgil who these spirits ""scourg'd by the black air"" are. Virgil replies that the first among them, ""empress o'er many tongues,"" was Semiramis, who in ""vice of luxury was so shameless"" that she made ""liking be lawful by promulg'd decree, to clear the blame she had herself incurr'd."" She succeeded Ninus and ruled the land now under the Soldan. The next ""in amorous fury slew herself,"" breaking faith with Sicheus (Dido). Then follows Cleopatra, ""lustful queen.""
He also sees Helen, Achilles (who ""with love fought to the end""), Paris, and Tristan. Virgil shows him ""a thousand more"" who were ""bereav'd of life"" by love.
Overpowered by pity, the protagonist's mind is almost lost. He expresses a desire to speak with ""those two together coming, which seem so light before the wind."" Virgil advises him to entreat them by the love that carries them.
As the wind sways them closer, the protagonist addresses them, ""O wearied spirits! come, and hold discourse with us, if by none else restrain'd."" Like doves invited by fond desire to their nest, two spirits issue from the troop where Dido ranks, speeding through the ill air, moved by his strong affection.
One spirit speaks, addressing him as a ""gracious creature and benign"" who visits them through this ""obscure element,"" they who ""the world with bloody stain imbru'd."" She states that if they had a friend in the ""King of all,"" their prayer would arise for his peace since he shows pity for their plight. She agrees to discourse freely while the wind is mute. She reveals her birthplace to be on the coast where the Po descends to the ocean.
She continues, explaining that ""Love, that in gentle heart is quickly learnt,"" entangled her beloved by her ""fair form,"" which was ""ta'en in such cruel sort, as grieves me still."" ""Love, that denial takes from none belov'd,"" caught her with pleasing him so well that he ""yet deserts me not."" ""Love brought us to one death: Caina waits the soul, who spilt our life.""
The protagonist looks down in anguish, pondering ""by what sweet thoughts, what fond desire must they at length to that ill pass have reach'd!"" He then addresses her as Francesca, expressing his grief and pity. He asks her to tell him ""by what, and how love granted, that ye knew your yet uncertain wishes?""
Francesca replies that ""No greater grief than to remember days of joy, when mis'ry is at hand!"" She then agrees to tell her tale, weeping as she speaks. One day, for their delight, they read of Lancelot and how love enthralled him. They were alone, with no suspicion near. Often, by that reading, their eyes met, and their cheeks blanched. But at one point, when they read of ""that smile, the wished smile, rapturously kiss'd by one so deep in love,"" the man who ""ne'er from me shall separate"" at once kissed her lips, all trembling. She concludes, ""The book and writer both were love's purveyors. In its leaves that day we read no more.""
While she speaks, the other spirit wails so sorely that the protagonist, heartstruck with compassion, faints and falls to the ground ""like a corpse.""

**CANTO VI**
The protagonist's senses revive, having drooped from pity for the ""kindred shades."" He finds himself in the ""third circle,"" where new torments and tormented souls appear. This circle is afflicted by ""show'rs ceaseless, accursed, heavy, and cold, unchang'd for ever."" Large hail, discolored water, and sleet stream down through the ""dun midnight air,"" making the land stink.
Cerberus, a ""cruel monster, fierce and strange,"" barks through his ""wide threefold throat"" over the immersed multitude. His eyes glare crimson, his beard is black and unctuous, his belly large, and his hands clawed, with which he tears, flays, and dismembers the spirits. The spirits howl like curs, screening themselves with one side and often rolling around in the ""rainy deluge.""
When Cerberus, ""that great worm,"" espies them, he opens his jaws and shows his fangs, trembling all over. Virgil fills his palms with earth and casts it into Cerberus's ""ravenous maw."" The demon quietens, like a dog that ceases barking when given food, dropping his ""loathsome cheeks.""
They pass over the prostrate shades, whose ""emptiness, that substance seem'd."" All lie extended on the earth, save one who suddenly sits up when he sees them. This spirit cries, ""O thou! who through the infernal shades art led, own, if again thou know'st me. Thou wast fram'd or ere my frame was broken."" The protagonist replies that the anguish he endures has perhaps so altered his form that he doesn't recognize him, and asks his identity.
The spirit answers that ""Thy city heap'd with envy to the brim,"" Florence, held him in brighter days, and citizens named him Ciacco. He suffers under the rain for the ""sin of glutt'ny, damned vice."" He is not alone in this woe; all present incurred like punishment for like crime.
The protagonist asks Ciacco about the fate of the ""divided city"" (Florence), if any just ones remain, and the cause of its discord. Ciacco prophesies that after long striving, they will ""come to blood,"" and ""the wild party from the woods"" will chase the other out. Within ""three solar circles,"" the wild party will fall, and the other will rise by ""borrow'd force of one, who under shore now rests."" This new power will oppress the other for a long time. He states that the ""just are two in number, but they neglected."" He attributes the city's woes to ""Av'rice, envy, pride, three fatal sparks.""
The protagonist then asks about Farinata, Tegghiaio, Giacopo, Arrigo, Mosca, and others ""who bent their minds on working good,"" inquiring where they bide and whether ""heaven's sweet cup or poisonous drug of hell be to their lip assign'd."" Ciacco replies that ""These are yet blacker spirits. Various crimes have sunk them deeper in the dark abyss. If thou so far descendest, thou mayst see them."" He entreats the protagonist to mention him when he returns to the ""pleasant world."" He then says, ""No more I tell thee, answer thee no more,"" turns his fixed eyes askance, bows his head, and falls amidst his ""blind companions.""
Virgil explains that Ciacco ""no more his bed he leaves, ere the last angel-trumpet blow."" Then, the ""Power Adverse to these shall then in glory come, Each one forthwith to his sad tomb repair, resume his fleshly vesture and his form, and hear the eternal doom re-echoing rend the vault.""
They pass through the ""foul mixture of spirits and rain with tardy steps."" The protagonist questions if these tortures will increase, mitigate, or remain severe after ""the great sentence passes."" Virgil replies that ""as each thing to more perfection grows, It feels more sensibly both good and pain."" Though the accursed race will never reach true perfection, they will approach it nearer then. They journey onward, discussing more, until they reach steps leading below, where they find Plutus.

**CANTO VII**
Plutus loudly exclaims, ""Ah me! O Satan! Satan!"" Virgil comforts the protagonist, assuring him that Plutus has no power to hinder their descent. Virgil then silences Plutus, calling him ""Curs'd wolf!"" and telling him to consume himself with fury, as the protagonist passes ""not without cause"" by divine will. Plutus drops to the ground like collapsed sails.
They descend to the ""fourth steep ledge,"" a dismal shore encompassing ""all the woe of all the universe."" The protagonist marvels at ""Almighty Justice!"" for the new pains and troubles.
He beholds a multitude, more numerous than elsewhere, who ""dance"" like waves against Charybdis. From both sides, with loud voices, they roll weights with their breasts, then collide, and each rolls back. One side exclaims, ""Why holdest thou so fast?"" and the other answers, ""And why castest thou away?"" They traverse the ""horrid circle,"" repeating their ""despiteful song,"" then meet again in the middle.
The protagonist, stung with grief, asks Virgil what race this is, and if those with ""shorn heads"" on their left were ""separate to the church."" Virgil replies that all these in their first life were ""so distorted"" in mind that they made no proper use of their wealth. Their words, howling at each extremity of the circle, confirm this. Those ""separate to the church,"" Popes and Cardinals, are ""crown'd with no hairy cowls"" and dominated by avarice.
The protagonist asks if he might recognize any of them. Virgil responds that such a thought is ""vain,"" as their ignoble life now makes them ""dark, and to all knowledge indiscernible."" They will forever meet in this ""rude shock,"" some rising from the tomb ""with clenched grasp"" (misers), others ""with close-shaven locks"" (prodigals). Their failure to ""give"" and ""keep"" wealth has deprived them of the beautiful world and set them in this strife. Virgil points out the brevity and vanity of ""goods committed into fortune's hands."" Not all the gold on earth could purchase rest for one of these souls.
The protagonist then asks Virgil to explain ""this fortune, that thou speak'st of, what it is, whose talons grasp the blessings of the world?""
Virgil explains that God, with ""transcendent wisdom,"" created the heavens with ruling powers for equal light distribution. Similarly, God ordained a ""guiding hand and general minister"" (Fortune) to rule over worldly goods, changing ""empty vantages of life from race to race, from one to other's blood,"" beyond man's wisest care. Fortune acts as she wills, unseen like a ""serpent train"" in the grass, planning, judging, and reigning with foresight, like other divine powers. Her changes are incessant, and she is swift to grant favors. She is ""execrated"" by those who owe her praise, yet she is blessed and ""in her bliss exults.""
They must now pass to ""heavier woe,"" as each star that mounted at their entrance is falling, forbidding further tarrying. They cross to the next steep, arriving at a well that boils down into a foss. The wave is murkier than ""sablest grain."" They journey by the inky waters, entering beneath by a different track.
The dismal stream expands into the ""Stygian nam'd"" lake at the foot of withered cliffs. The protagonist gazes at a ""miry tribe, all naked, and with looks betok'ning rage"" sunk in the marsh. They strike each other with hands, heads, breasts, feet, and tear each other piecemeal with their fangs.
Virgil explains these are the souls of those ""whom anger overcame."" He also reveals that ""underneath the water dwells a multitude, whose sighs into these bubbles make the surface heave."" Fixed in the slime, these say, ""'Sad once were we in the sweet air made gladsome by the sun, carrying a foul and lazy mist within: Now in these murky settlings are we sad.'"" They gurgle this ""dolorous strain,"" but cannot utter distinct words. They continue their route along the embankment and the pool, observing those ""who gulp'd its muddy lees,"" until they reach a tower's base.

**CANTO VIII**
Before reaching the tower's base, they spot two cressets hanging high, and from afar, another light returning the signal. The protagonist asks Virgil for its meaning. Virgil replies they will soon see what awaits them on the ""filthy waters,"" if the marsh fog does not conceal it.
A small bark, ferried by a single figure, swiftly approaches. The boatman cries, ""Art thou arriv'd, fell spirit?"" Virgil replies, ""Phlegyas, Phlegyas, this time thou criest in vain; no longer shalt thou have us, but while o'er the slimy pool we pass."" Phlegyas, hearing this, pines ""in his fierce ire.""
Virgil steps into the skiff and bids the protagonist enter next to him. The vessel seems freighted only after their entrance. The ancient prow cuts the waves more deeply than usual.
As they cross the ""dead channel,"" one spirit, drenched in mire, asks the protagonist, ""Who art thou, that thou comest ere thine hour?"" The protagonist replies he comes but does not tarry and asks the spirit's identity. The spirit says he is ""one, as thou seest, who mourn."" The protagonist recognizes him, even disguised in filth, and tells him to ""tarry"" in mourning. The spirit stretches hands to the bark, but Virgil thrusts him back, exclaiming, ""Away! down there, to the other dogs!""
Virgil then embraces the protagonist, kissing his cheek, and praising him as ""justly disdainful,"" saying he was ""conceiv'd"" in a blessed woman. He identifies the spirit as one ""for arrogance noted"" in the world, whose ""shadow furious"" is here. Many ""mighty kings"" above will wallow like swine in this mire, leaving ""horrible dispraise.""
The protagonist expresses a desire to see this spirit ""whelm'd in these dregs"" before they leave the lake. Virgil assures him his wish will be satisfied. Scarcely have Virgil's words ended when the ""miry tribes"" set on the spirit with such violence that the protagonist gives thanks to God. They all cry, ""To Filippo Argenti!"" and the ""moody Florentine"" turns his ""avenging fangs"" on himself. They leave him there.
Suddenly, a sound of lamentation strikes the protagonist's ear. Virgil announces that ""Draws near the city, that of Dis is nam'd, with its grave denizens, a mighty throng."" The protagonist descries minarets ""gleaming vermilion, as if they from fire had issu'd."" Virgil explains these are eternally burning fires that illuminate them in ""this nether hell.""
They reach the deep fosses that moat this comfortless region. The walls appear to be made of iron. After a wide circuit, they arrive where the mariner (Phlegyas) vehemently cries, ""Go forth! The entrance is here!""
On the gates, the protagonist spies ""more than a thousand"" spirits, ""hurl'd of old from heaven."" With ireful gestures, they demand, ""Who is this, that without death first felt, goes through the regions of the dead?"" Virgil signals a desire for secret parley. Their anger abating, they say, ""Come thou alone; and let him go who hath so hardily enter'd this realm. Alone return he by his witless way."" They tell the protagonist he must tarry there as Virgil's escort. The protagonist is filled with fear, believing he will never return.
He cries to Virgil, his ""lov'd guide,"" who has rendered him security ""more than seven times,"" not to desert him. He asks to retrace their steps if they are denied passage. Virgil replies, ""Fear not: for of our passage none hath power to disappoint us, by such high authority permitted."" He tells the protagonist to wait, comfort his spirit, and feed it with hope, assuring him he will not be left.
Virgil then departs and quits the protagonist, who remains hesitating, ""at war 'twixt will and will not."" He cannot hear the terms Virgil offers, but they confer not long, for the adversaries ""fled within"" and closed the gates on Virgil's breast. Excluded, Virgil returns with tardy steps, eyes bent on the ground, all confidence erased, sighing, ""Who hath denied me these abodes of woe?"" He tells the protagonist not to fear his anger, for he will vanquish their hindrance. He notes this insolence is not new, as they displayed it ""at gate less secret,"" which is ""still without bolt,"" and the protagonist saw the ""deadly scroll"" on its arch. He announces that ""even now on this side of its entrance, down the steep, passing the circles, unescorted, comes one whose strong might can open us this land.""

**CANTO IX**
The protagonist's fear, imprinted on his pale cheeks, causes Virgil's newly worn hue to be chased and inwardly restrained. Virgil stands attentive, listening, as his eye cannot penetrate the ""sable air, and the thick-gath'ring cloud."" He begins, ""It yet behooves we win this fight,"" then adds, ""if not—Such aid to us is offer'd.—Oh, how long me seems it, ere the promis'd help arrive!"" The protagonist notes the words are inconsistent, increasing his fear.
He asks Virgil if anyone ever descends into this ""rueful concave's extreme depth"" from the first degree (Limbo), whose pain is merely ""deprivation of sweet hope."" Virgil replies it ""Rarely"" happens, but he once came here, conjured by the sorceress Erictho, who compelled shades back to their bodies. Virgil states he entered these walls to draw forth a spirit from ""Judas' circle,"" the ""Lowest place"" of all, ""obscurest, and remov'd farthest from heav'n's all-circling orb."" He knows the road well and assures the protagonist. He adds that the ""noisome stench"" of the lake encompasses the ""city of grief,"" which they cannot enter without rage.
Virgil adds more, but the protagonist does not remember, as his eye is drawn to the burning top of the lofty tower. He instantly beholds ""three hellish furies stain'd with blood,"" feminine in limb and motion, with green hydras twisting around them and adders and cerastes for hair.
Virgil, knowing these ""miserable hags"" who tend the ""queen of endless woe,"" identifies them: Megaera (left), Alecto (right), and Tisiphone (middle). They claw their breasts, smite themselves, and raise such a clamor that the protagonist clings to Virgil. They cry, ""Hasten Medusa: so to adamant him shall we change."" They add that even when assailed by Theseus, they took ""no ill revenge."" Virgil warns the protagonist to turn around and hide his countenance, for if he views the ""Gorgon dire,"" his ""return upwards would be for ever lost."" Virgil turns him around and hides him with his own hands. The narrator addresses readers to note the ""lore conceal'd under close texture of the mystic strain.""
A loud-crashing, terrible sound comes over the perturbed waves, making both shores tremble, like an impetuous wind. Virgil unbinds the protagonist's eyes and tells him to direct his sight along the ""ancient foam,"" where the smoke is thickest. He sees ""more than a thousand spirits destroy'd"" fleeing before one who passes with ""unwet feet the Stygian sound."" This figure removes the ""gross air"" from his face, often stretching forth his left hand, seeming only weary from the annoyance. The protagonist perceives he is ""sent from heav'n"" and turns to Virgil, who signals him to stand quiet and bow to him. The heavenly messenger seems full of ""noble anger."" He comes to the gate and touches it with his wand, and it ""flew open without impediment.""
Standing on the ""horrid grunsel,"" he addresses the ""Outcasts of heav'n! O abject race and scorn'd!"" demanding to know the source of their insolence and why they oppose God's will, which has ""laid on you enforcement of your pangs."" He reminds them that their Cerberus still bears a peeled throat and maw from a previous encounter.
He then turns back along the ""filthy way,"" speaking no syllable to them, but appearing beset by other cares. They then move their steps ""toward that territory, secure after the hallow'd words."" They enter unopposed.
The protagonist, eager to learn, looks around and sees ""wide-stretching space replete with bitter pain and torment ill."" It resembles the sepulchers of Arles or Pola, but with scattered flames amidst the graves, burning intensely, hotter than iron for any craft. Their lids hang suspended, and from beneath, ""lamentable moans"" issue.
The protagonist asks Virgil who is interred in these vaults. Virgil replies that ""The arch-heretics are here, accompanied by every sect their followers."" Many more tombs are freighted, with ""like with like"" buried, and monuments differing ""in degrees of heat."" Virgil then turns to the right, and they pass between the afflicted and the high ramparts.

**CANTO X**
They proceed by a ""secret pathway"" between the walls and the tormented souls, Virgil first, the protagonist behind. The protagonist asks if those within the sepulchres can be seen, as the lids are raised and none keep watch. Virgil answers that the lids ""shall be closed all, what-time they here from Josaphat return'd shall come, and bring their bodies, which above they now have left."" He explains that this part of the cemetery holds Epicurus and his followers, who ""with the body make the spirit die."" He assures the protagonist that his question and silent wish will soon be satisfied. The protagonist says he only conceals his heart to avoid ""vain length of words,"" a lesson Virgil taught him.
Suddenly, a voice from a vault cries, ""O Tuscan! thou who through the city of fire alive art passing, so discreet of speech! Here please thee stay awhile. Thy utterance declares the place of thy nativity to be that noble land, with which perchance I too severely dealt."" The protagonist, startled, moves closer to Virgil, who tells him to turn. ""Lo, Farinata, there! who hath himself uplifted: from his girdle upwards all expos'd behold him."" Farinata, with breast and forehead erect, seems to hold even hell in scorn. Virgil pushes the protagonist toward him, warning him to ""See thy words be clear!""
Farinata eyes the protagonist, then disdainfully asks, ""Say, what ancestors were thine?"" The protagonist reveals his lineage. Farinata, somewhat uplifting his brow, cries that they were ""fiercely adverse to me, my party, and the blood from whence I sprang: twice therefore I abroad scatter'd them."" The protagonist replies that ""Though driv'n out, yet they each time from all parts return'd; an art which yours have shown, they are not skill'd to learn.""
Then, from Farinata's side, a shade rises ""high as the chin,"" peering forth from the unclosed jaw, leaning on its raised knees. It looks around, as if to find someone else with the protagonist. Perceiving its ""fond imagination quench'd,"" it speaks with tears: ""If thou through this blind prison go'st, led by thy lofty genius and profound, where is my son? and wherefore not with thee?""
The protagonist replies he comes not of himself, but is conducted by Virgil, ""whom perchance Guido thy son had in contempt."" The words and context reveal the name. The shade, ""up starting,"" exclaims, ""How! said'st thou he HAD? No longer lives he? Strikes not on his eye the blessed daylight?"" When the protagonist delays his reply, the shade falls supine and is seen no more.
Meanwhile, Farinata, ""great of soul,"" remains stern, unchanged. Continuing their first discourse, he cries, ""And if they in this art small skill have shown, that doth torment me more e'en than this bed."" He prophesies that ""not yet fifty times shall be relum'd her aspect, who reigns here Queen of this realm, ere thou shalt know the full weight of that art."" He asks, if the protagonist wishes to return to the world, why the people of Florence are ""so fell"" against his kin.
The protagonist blames ""The slaughter and great havoc that colour'd Arbia's flood with crimson stain."" Farinata sighs and shakes his head, then replies that he ""stood not singly"" in that affray, but ""singly there I stood, when by consent of all, Florence had to the ground been raz'd, The one who openly forbad the deed.""
The protagonist adjures him to solve another doubt: ""Ye seem to view beforehand, that which time leads with him, of the present uninform'd."" Farinata answers that they ""view, as one who hath an evil sight, plainly, objects far remote."" God imparts ""so much of his large spendour"" to them, but ""when they approach or actually exist, our intellect then wholly fails, nor of your human state except what others bring us know we aught."" He concludes that their knowledge will expire when ""on futurity the portals close.""
Conscious of his fault, the protagonist, smitten by remorse, asks him to tell the fallen shade that his ""offspring still is to the living join'd"" and that his silence was due to his thoughts being intent on the error Virgil just solved.
Virgil summons him back. The protagonist eagerly asks Farinata who else shares his lot. Farinata replies, ""More than a thousand with me here are laid. Within is Frederick, second of that name, And the Lord Cardinal, and of the rest I speak not."" He then withdraws from sight.
The protagonist, returning to Virgil, ruminates on the words ""betokening me such ill."" Virgil, moving onward, asks about his ""amaze."" The protagonist satisfies the inquiry, and Virgil enjoins him to ""store what thou hast heard to thee importing harm"" and notes that ""When thou shalt stand before her gracious beam, whose bright eye all surveys, she of thy life the future tenour will to thee unfold.""
Virgil then turns his feet to the left. They leave the wall and go towards a path striking to a valley, which ""e'en thus high exhal'd its noisome steam.""

**CANTO XI**
They arrive at the ""utmost verge of a high bank, by craggy rocks environ'd,"" where ""woes beneath more cruel yet were stow'd."" To avoid the ""horrible excess of fetid exhalation,"" they stand retired behind the lid of a great monument. On it, the protagonist sees a scroll: ""I have in charge Pope Anastasius, whom Photinus drew from the right path."" Virgil explains they must delay their descent to accustom their senses to the dire breath. The protagonist agrees, asking for some compensation of the time.
Virgil says his thoughts align with the protagonist's wishes. He then explains that within these rocks are ""three close circles in gradation plac'd."" Each is full of accursed spirits, and to suffice the sight, he will explain why and how they abide in durance.
He states that the end of all ""malicious act abhorr'd in heaven"" is ""injury,"" which works woe ""either by force or fraud."" Fraud, being ""peculiar evil"" to man, is more displeasing to God, so the fraudulent endure ""severer pang."" The violent occupy the first of these three circles, framed in three rounds because ""three persons are obnoxious"" to force: God, his neighbor, and himself.
Force against one's neighbor includes ""violent death, and painful wounds,"" and wasting ""substance by devastation, pillage, and the flames."" Slayers, malicious smiters, plunderers, and robbers suffer in the first round in different herds.
Man can do violence ""to himself and his own blessings."" For this, he in the second round must ""aye deplore with unavailing penitence his crime,"" whoever ""deprives himself of life and light"" (suicides) and wastes his talent in ""reckless lavishment"" (prodigals, here not previously mentioned as distinct from misers).
Force may be offered ""to God, in the heart denying and blaspheming his high power, and nature with her kindly law contemning."" Hence, the inmost round marks Sodom and Cahors (sodomites and usurers), and those who speak contemptuously of the Godhead.
Fraud, which stings every conscience, can be employed on one whose trust is won, or on another who withholds strict confidence. The latter breaks only the bond of love nature makes. Thus, in the second circle (of fraud, here described as less malicious), dwell dissimulation, witchcraft, flatteries, theft, falsehood, simony, seducers to lust, and those who pawn their honesty. The other way (fraud against trust, here described as more malicious) forgets both nature's general love and the ""special faith"" added. Thus, ""in the lesser circle, point of the universe, dread seat of Dis,"" the traitor is ""eternally consum'd.""
The protagonist acknowledges Virgil's clear discourse and distinction of the chasm's inhabitants. He then asks why those in the ""dull, fat pool,"" beaten by rain, driven by tempest, or conflicting with fierce tongues (from earlier circles), are not punished within the ""city fire-illum'd"" if God's wrath is on them. And if not, why are they condemned?
Virgil asks why his mind wanders, not accustomed to such thoughts. He reminds the protagonist of ""thy ethic page"" (Aristotle) which describes ""Three dispositions adverse to Heav'n's will, Incont'nence, malice, and mad brutishness,"" and how incontinence ""the least offends God, and least guilt incurs."" If he notes this judgment and remembers those ""without these walls to vain repentance doom'd,"" he will discern why they are placed apart and receive less vengeful divine justice.
The protagonist praises Virgil as a ""Sun!"" who heals his imperfect sight and solves his doubt, making ignorance as charming as knowledge. He then asks Virgil to explain why usury ""offends celestial Goodness.""
Virgil replies that philosophy clearly points out how ""imitative nature takes her course from the celestial mind and from its art."" He mentions the ""Stagyrite"" (Aristotle), whose laws, when unfolded, show that human art follows nature, being ""second in descent from God."" These two (nature and art), from creation's holy book, were the right source of life and excellence for mankind. But the usurer ""walks in another path,"" setting nature and her follower at naught, placing his hope elsewhere.
Virgil then urges them to follow his steps, as ""the Pisces play with undulating glance along the horizon,"" and ""the Wain lies all o'er the north-west,"" indicating it is time for their ""steep passage down the rocky height.""

**CANTO XII**
The place where they descend the precipice is ""rough as Alp,"" with an object on its verge ""as every eye would shun."" It is a ruin, like that struck by the Adice river near Trento, shattered from the mountain's summit, creating a passage. Stretched at the point of the ridge is ""the infamy of Crete, detested brood of the feign'd heifer"" (the Minotaur), gnawing itself in rage.
Virgil exclaims to the Minotaur, ""Perchance thou deem'st the King of Athens here, who, in the world above, thy death contriv'd. Monster! avaunt! He comes not tutor'd by thy sister's art, but to behold your torments is he come."" The Minotaur plunges like a bull struck by a fatal blow. Virgil tells the protagonist to ""Run to the passage! while he storms, 't is well that thou descend.""
They take their road down through dilapidated crags, which often move under the protagonist's feet, unused to such weight. The protagonist ponders this, and Virgil explains that when he ""erst hither descended to the nether hell,"" this rock had not yet fallen. He deduces that it fell ""not long ere He arrived, who carried off from Dis the mighty spoil of the highest circle,"" causing a trembling throughout the ""deep concave and foul,"" as if the universe was thrilled with love. At that time, this old rock toppled down here and elsewhere.
Virgil then directs the protagonist's eyes beneath, where ""the river of blood approaches, in the which all those are steep'd, who have by violence injur'd."" The narrator exclaims against ""blind lust"" and ""foolish wrath"" that goad in brief life and overwhelm miserably in eternity.
He beholds an ""ample foss, that in a bow was bent,"" circling the plain. Between it and the rampart, Centaurs run on trail, armed with keen arrows, as they were in life. Seeing them descend, the Centaurs stop. Three, with bows and missile weapons, speed forth, and one cries from afar, ""Say to what pain ye come condemn'd, who down this steep have journied? Speak from whence ye stand, or else the bow I draw.""
Virgil replies they will answer Chiron when nearer, rebuking the Centaur for his quick and rash mind. Virgil touches the protagonist and identifies the Centaur as Nessus, ""who for the fair Deianira died, and wrought himself revenge for his own fate."" The one in the middle, looking down on his breast, is Chiron, who nursed Achilles. The other is Pholus, ""prone to wrath."" Thousands of Centaurs patrol the foss, aiming shafts at any spirit emerging from the blood more than their guilt allows.
They approach the Centaurs, and Chiron takes an arrow, pushes back his shaggy beard with the notch, and, exposing his mouth, exclaims to his fellows, ""Are ye aware, that he who comes behind moves what he touches? The feet of the dead are not so wont."" Virgil, standing near Chiron's breast (where the two natures join), replies that the protagonist is ""indeed alive,"" and he must needs be shown the gloomy vale, induced by ""strict necessity, not by delight."" He states that a ""Dame from heaven"" consigned this new office to his care. He affirms he is no robber or dark spirit. He asks Chiron to grant one of his band to guide them to the ford and convey the protagonist across on his back, as he is not a spirit who can walk the air.
Chiron turns to Nessus and tells him to return and be their guide, commanding any other troop to keep aloof. They move onward with Nessus, their faithful escort, along the border of the ""crimson-seething flood,"" from which loud shrieks arise.
The protagonist marks some immersed up to their brow. Nessus identifies these as ""the souls of tyrants, who were given to blood and rapine,"" wailing their ""merciless wrongs."" He points out Alexander and Dionysius, who wrought years of woe for Sicily. He identifies Azzolino by his ""jetty clust'ring hair"" and Obizzo of Este (destroyed by his step-son) by his ""flaxen locks."" The protagonist turns to Virgil, who says Nessus should be his first leader.
Nessus pauses near others immersed to the throat and points out a spirit apart, exclaiming, ""He in God's bosom smote the heart, which yet is honour'd on the bank of Thames.""
Next, the protagonist espies a race holding their heads and busts above the stream, recognizing many faces. The blood becomes shallower, eventually only imbruing their feet, and their path lies across the foss.
Nessus explains that as the boiling wave diminishes on this side, it sinks lower on the other, joining where ""tyranny is to mourn."" There, Heaven's justice chastises Attila (""scourge of earth""), Sextus, and Pyrrhus, extracting tears from the Rinieri (of Corneto) and Pazzo, who filled the ways with violence and war. Nessus then turns and, quitting them, repasses the ford alone.

**CANTO XIII**
Before Nessus reaches the other bank, they enter a forest with no worn path. The foliage is dusky, not verdant; the boughs are gnarled and thick, not light and tapering; there are thorns filled with venom instead of fruits. The narrator compares the brakes to those where animals hating cultivated fields abide between Corneto and Cecina's stream.
Here, ""brute Harpies make their nest,"" the same who drove the Trojan band from Strophades with dire omens. They have broad wings, human necks and countenances, keen talons for feet, and huge bellies fledged with wings. They sit and wail in this ""drear mystic wood.""
Virgil informs the protagonist that he is in the ""second round"" until he reaches the ""horrid sand,"" advising him to look around for things that would discredit his speech. The protagonist hears sad plainings but sees no one, standing amazed. Virgil, thinking the voices come from hidden figures, tells him, ""If thou lop off a single twig from one of those ill plants, the thought thou hast conceiv'd shall vanish quite.""
The protagonist stretches forth his hand, plucks a branch from a ""great wilding,"" and the trunk exclaims, ""Why pluck'st thou me?"" As dark blood trickles, it adds, ""Wherefore tear'st me thus? Is there no touch of mercy in thy breast? Men once were we, that now are rooted here."" It states his hand ""might well have spar'd us, had we been the souls of serpents."" Words and blood burst from the broken splinter like a green brand hissing in the wind.
The protagonist lets fall the bough, terror-struck. Virgil apologizes to the injured spirit, explaining that the protagonist would not have done it had he believed what he has only read in verse. He prompted the deed because it ""surpass'd belief."" He asks the spirit who he was, so the protagonist may ""revive his fame"" in the upper world.
The trunk replies that Virgil's ""pleasant word"" has so ""inveigled"" him that he cannot refrain from speech. He was one ""who held both keys to Frederick's heart,"" opening and shutting his inmost breast with skill. His faith to his ""high charge"" cost him his life-blood. The ""harlot, who ne'er turn'd her gloating eyes from Caesar's household,"" inflamed minds against him, turning his ""glad honours"" to woes. His ""soul, disdainful and disgusted,"" sought refuge in death from scorn, becoming ""unjust toward myself."" He swears by his roots that he never broke faith with his liege lord and asks, if any return to the world, to clear his memory from ""envy's cruel blow.""
After a pause, Virgil tells the protagonist to speak and ask more if he wishes. The protagonist replies he cannot, due to pity in his heart. Virgil then asks the spirit how the soul is tied in these ""gnarled joints"" and if any are ever ""loosen'd from such frame.""
The trunk breathes hard, and the wind changes into articulate sounds. He replies that when the ""fierce soul from the body...torn asunder"" departs, Minos dooms it to the ""seventh gulf."" It falls into the wood ""no place assign'd, but wheresoever chance hurls it,"" sprouting like a grain into a sapling, then a ""savage plant."" The Harpies feed on its leaves, causing pain and a ""vent to grief."" They, like the rest, shall come for their ""own spoils,"" but will not be clad again in them, ""for what a man takes from himself it is not just he have."" Their bodies will be hung ""each on the wild thorn of his wretched shade.""
As they listen, a noise like a wild boar and hunt approaching surprises them. Two naked spirits, torn with briers, flee headlong, breaking through the wood. The foremost cries, ""Haste now, now haste thee death!"" The other, impatient, exclaims, ""Lano! not so bent for speed thy sinews, in the lists of Toppo's field."" He then makes himself one group with a bush, perhaps for lack of breath. Behind them, the wood is full of ""black female mastiffs, gaunt and fleet,"" like greyhounds slipped from leash. They seize the squatted spirit, tear him piecemeal, and bear away his limbs. Virgil seizes the protagonist's hand and leads him to the thicket, which mourns through its bleeding wounds, crying, ""O Giacomo of Sant' Andrea! what avails it thee that of me thou hast made thy screen? For thy ill life what blame on me recoils?""
Virgil asks the thicket who he was. He replies, ""O ye spirits: arriv'd in time to spy the shameful havoc, that from me my leaves hath sever'd thus, gather them up, and at the foot of their sad parent-tree carefully lay them."" He states he dwelt in the city (Florence) that changed her patron for the Baptist, whence the Baptist ""shall cease not with his art to work her woe."" If some ""faint glimpse of him"" (the Baptist) had not remained on Arno's passage, those citizens who rebuilt her walls after Attila's ashes would have toiled in vain. He concludes, ""I slung the fatal noose from my own roof.""

**CANTO XIV**
Moved by ""charity of native land,"" the protagonist collects the scattered leaves and restores them to the hoarse-voiced spirit. They reach the limit dividing the second and third rounds, where ""horrible contrivance"" of justice is displayed. They enter a plain of ""arid sand and thick,"" resembling the soil Cato trod, which repels every plant. The ""mournful wood waves round its garland on all sides,"" and the ""sad foss spreads round the wood.""
Many naked spirits are seen, all weeping piteously, subjected to different laws: some supine on the earth, some crouching, others pacing incessantly. The pacers are most numerous, the supine fewer but louder in grief.
Over all the sand, ""dilated flakes of fire"" fall slowly, like snow on an Alpine summit when the wind is hushed. The narrator compares it to the solid flames Alexander saw descending on his army in India, which he had his troops trample to extinguish the vapor. So falls the ""eternal fiery flood,"" making the marble glow ""as under stove the viands, doubly to augment the pain.""
Wretched hands incessantly ply, shaking off the fresh-falling heat. The protagonist asks Virgil who the ""huge spirit"" is that ""heeds not the burning, but lies writhen in proud scorn.""
The spirit himself, aware of the question, exclaims, ""Such as I was when living, dead such now I am. If Jove weary his workman out... if the rest be weary out at their black smithy labouring... and the bolts launch he full aim'd at me with all his might, He never should enjoy a sweet revenge.""
Virgil, in a raised voice, replies, ""Capaneus! Thou art more punish'd, in that this thy pride lives yet unquench'd: no torrent, save thy rage, were to thy fury pain proportion'd full."" He then turns to the protagonist with milder lip, explaining that Capaneus was one of the ""seven kings, who girt the Theban walls with siege,"" and still holds God in disdain, setting His omnipotence at naught. But his ""despiteful mood is ornament well suits the breast that wears it.""
Virgil tells the protagonist to follow him, keeping close to the wood and not stepping on the hot sand. They pass silently to a little brook gushing from the forest's bound, whose ""crimson'd wave yet lifts my hair with horror."" It runs through the sand like the rill from Bulicame, its bottom and banks ""stone-built,"" where their passage lies.
Virgil declares this river to be the most worthy of regard of all he has shown, as ""o'er which the flaming volley all is quench'd."" The protagonist asks for an explanation.
Virgil begins by describing Crete, an island in the ocean, where the world once lived pure and chaste under its monarch. A mountain called Ida there, once joyous, now deserted, was where Rhea hid Saturn's son, drowning his cries with shouts. Within the mount, a ""huge ancient form"" stands upright, turning its shoulders toward Damiata and looking at Rome ""as in his mirror."" Its head is of ""finest gold,"" breast and arms of ""pure silver,"" then to the middle of ""brass,"" and downward all beneath ""well-temper'd steel,"" save the right foot of ""potter's clay."" Each part except the gold is rent, and from the fissures tears distil, joining to penetrate a cave. These tears form Acheron, Styx, and Phlegethon, then passing beneath through a straitened channel, form Cocytus in the lowest depth, which the protagonist will see later.
The protagonist asks why, if this sluice is derived from their world, it appears only now. Virgil explains the place is round, and though they have passed a great part, descending to the nethermost, they have not yet circled the whole orb.
The protagonist then asks where Phlegethon and Lethe flow, as one was not mentioned and the other is formed from the shower. Virgil replies that his questions please him, but the ""red seething wave"" (Phlegethon) should have resolved one. Lethe, he says, will be seen ""not within this hollow, in the place, whither to lave themselves the spirits go, whose blame hath been by penitence remov'd.""
He concludes that it is time to leave the wood and instructs the protagonist to follow his steps, as the margins provide safe passage, unimpeded by flames because ""over them all vapour is extinct.""

**CANTO XV**
They are now borne on one of the solid margins, enveloped in a mist from the stream that hovers over and protects the piers and water from fire. The narrator compares these mounds to those built by Flemings between Ghent and Bruges, or by Paduans along the Brenta, to defend against floods.
Not far from the wood, they meet a troop of spirits walking beside the pier. They eye the protagonist intently, like an old tailor at a needle's eye. One recognizes the protagonist, catches him by the skirt, and cries, ""What wonder have we here!""
The protagonist fixes his gaze on the spirit's parched looks, and though smirched with fire, he remembers him. He asks, ""Sir! Brunetto! And art thou here?"" Brunetto Latini asks if it would displease the protagonist if he turned back a little to speak with him, leaving his fellows. The protagonist eagerly agrees, offering to sit with him if Virgil permits.
Brunetto explains that anyone from this throng who stops for an instant lies for a hundred years without ventilation from the fire. He bids the protagonist pass on, and he will walk close by his garments, then rejoin his troop. The protagonist dares not descend to walk on equal ground, but holds his head bent down.
Brunetto asks what chance or destiny brings him here before his last day, and who guides him. The protagonist replies that in the ""life serene,"" he wandered lost in a valley before his age reached fullness. He met Virgil ""yester-morn"" and is now being led back home by this path.
Brunetto answers that if the protagonist follows his ""star,"" he will reach a ""glorious haven,"" unless Brunetto's judgment erred in ""fairer days."" He wishes he could have given comfort in the protagonist's work, but the ""ungrateful and malignant race"" from Fesole, still showing their ""rough mountain-flint"" nature, will show enmity for his good deeds. He warns that it ""suits not the sweet fig-tree lay her fruit"" amongst ""ill-savour'd crabs."" He describes them as blind, covetous, envious, and proud, advising the protagonist to cleanse himself of their ways. He prophesies that the protagonist's fortune has such honor in reserve that ""either party shalt be crav'd with hunger keen,"" but he should keep ""the fresh herb far from the goat's tooth."" The ""herd of Fesole"" may make litter of themselves but should not touch the plant (the protagonist), if any such still springs from their ""rank bed,"" where the ""holy seed revives"" from true Romans.
The protagonist replies that if his wish were fulfilled, Brunetto would not have been driven from ""man's nature."" He keeps the ""dear, benign, paternal image"" of Brunetto fixed in his mind, remembering how he taught him ""the way for man to win eternity."" He resolves to speak of this lesson as long as life endures. He writes down what Brunetto tells him of his fate and keeps it with ""another text to comment on for her, the celestial dame, who will know all, if I to her arrive."" He declares his conscience clear, prepared for fortune's will.
Virgil, turning back, smiles and says, ""He listens to good purpose who takes note.""
The protagonist continues, discoursing with Brunetto, asking who are most known among his tribe. Brunetto replies it's good to know some, but silence is best for the rest, as time is short. He briefly states that all these were ""clerks, men of great learning and no less renown, by one same sin polluted."" He names Priscian and Francesco, Accorso's son, and says if the protagonist wished to see ""so impure a blotch,"" he might have seen one transferred ""from Arno's seat to Bacchiglione, where his ill-strain'd nerves he left."" Brunetto would add more, but must desist from speech and way, as he sees ""a mist new-risen on the sandy plain."" A company he cannot join approaches. He commends his ""TREASURE"" (presumably his literary works) to the protagonist, ""wherein I yet survive.""
Brunetto then turns and seems like one who tries for the green mantle prize in Verona's champaign, ""not he who loses but who gains the prize.""

**CANTO XVI**
The protagonist arrives where the water's din is heard, falling into the next round, like the hum of swarming bees. From a troop passing beneath the ""fierce tormenting storm,"" three spirits run swiftly towards them, crying, ""Oh do thou stay! Whom by the fashion of thy garb we deem to be some inmate of our evil land."" The narrator notes the wounds on their limbs, both recent and old, inflicted by the flames, grieving at the memory.
Virgil pauses and turns to the protagonist, saying, ""Wait now! our courtesy these merit well: And were 't not for the nature of the place, whence glide the fiery darts, I should have said, That haste had better suited thee than them.""
When they stop, the three spirits resume their wail, and as they reach them, they whirl around together ""in one restless wheel,"" like naked champions smeared with oil. Each directs his face at the protagonist, their necks moving opposite their feet.
One spirit begins, asking the protagonist, ""who thou art, that dost imprint with living feet unharm'd the soil of Hell."" He points out his companion as Guidoguerra, ""grandchild of the chaste Gualdrada,"" of high estate, who achieved noble acts by wisdom and sword. The next is Aldobrandi, deserving of honor in the upper world. The speaker identifies himself as Rusticucci, brought to this evil by his ""savage temper"" wife, more than aught else. The protagonist states that if not for fear of fire, he would have cast himself among them, and his guide would not have restrained him, but fear vanquished his desire for their embrace.
He tells them that their doom fills him not with scorn but with grief, fixed deep within him since Virgil spoke of their race. He says he is their countryman, affectionate to their renowned deeds and names. He is leaving ""the gall for the sweet fruit"" with a sure guide, tending downward to the center first.
Guidoguerra asks the protagonist to tell if ""courtesy and valour, as they wont, dwell in our city, or have vanish'd clean?"" for one recently condemned to wail, Borsiere, grieves them with his news. The protagonist cries, ""An upstart multitude and sudden gains, pride and excess, O Florence! have in thee engender'd, so that now in tears thou mourn'st!"" The three spirits look at each other as if hearing truth. They tell him if he easily satisfies questioners, he is happy. They ask him to speak of them among mankind if he escapes ""this darksome clime"" and returns to see the stars.
They break the circle and flee swiftly. The protagonist notes they vanished quicker than one could say ""Amen."" Virgil pursues his track, and the protagonist follows. The sound of water becomes so loud they can barely hear each other.
The narrator describes the water's sound as like a river (Acquacheta) that rebellows over Saint Benedict as it falls from an Alpine summit down a precipice, where space enough for a thousand spreads.
The protagonist has a cord around his girdle, which he once thought to use to bind the ""painted leopard."" At Virgil's command, he unloosens it and hands it to him. Virgil turns to the right, and from the brink, a few paces distant, casts it down into the deep abyss. The protagonist wonders what strange signal this is that Virgil follows intently. He reflects on how men must be cautious with those who ""spy into the thoughts with subtle skill.""
Virgil says that what he expects, the protagonist's eye will quickly discover, and ""that whereof thy thought is dreaming."" The narrator comments that a man should bar his lip from truth that wears ""the semblance of a falsehood,"" but here silence is vain. He swears, by his notes, that through the ""gross and murky air,"" he spied ""A shape come swimming up, that might have quell'd the stoutest heart with wonder,"" like one returning from loosening an anchor or aught else from the sea, drawing in his feet as he springs upward.

**CANTO XVII**
Virgil addresses the protagonist, ""Lo! the fell monster with the deadly sting! Who passes mountains, breaks through fenced walls and firm embattled spears, and with his filth taints all the world!"" He beckons the monster to shore.
The ""vile image of fraud"" (Geryon) appears, its head and upper part on land, but its ""bestial train"" not on the shore. Its face resembles a ""just man,"" kind and gracious, but the rest is serpent. Two shaggy claws reach its armpits, and its back, breast, and sides are painted with nodes and orbits in variegated colors. It sits perched on the rim, its tail upturned, armed with a scorpion's sting.
Virgil states they must turn toward this ""ill beast."" They shape their course to the right, proceeding ten paces along the verge to escape the flame and burning marl. Arriving, the protagonist sees a ""tribe of spirits, seated on the sand near the wide chasm."" Virgil tells him to go and mark their mien but not to speak long, as he will parley with Geryon to gain the ""aid of his strong shoulders.""
The protagonist walks alone along the extremity of the seventh circle, where the ""mournful tribe"" is seated. Pangs gush from their eyes. They alternately ply their shifting hands against the vapors and torrid soil, like dogs in summer warding off gnats or flies.
He notes their visages, but knows none of them, only perceiving that each bears a pouch hanging from his neck, ""with colours and with emblems various mark'd,"" on which ""it seem'd as if their eye did feed."" He sees a yellow purse with an azure lion, then a redder one with a white-winged goose. One, bearing a fat, azure swine on his white scrip, asks, ""What dost thou in this deep? Go now and know, since yet thou livest, that my neighbour here Vitaliano on my left shall sit. A Paduan with these Florentines am I. Ofttimes they thunder in mine ears, exclaiming 'O haste that noble knight! he who the pouch with the three beaks will bring!'"" He then writhes his mouth and lolls his tongue like an ox licking his nostrils. The protagonist turns back from these spirits.
He finds Virgil already seated on the ""haunch of the fierce animal"" (Geryon). Virgil encourages him to be ""stout"" and ""bold,"" as they must descend a ""steep flight."" He tells the protagonist to mount first, and he will be in the middle to prevent the tail from harming him.
The protagonist, hearing this, turns blue and quivers like one with an ague fit. But shame makes him bold. He settles on Geryon's huge shoulders, wanting to say, ""Look thou clasp me firm!"" but the words fail. Virgil, whose succor he has proved before, embraces him and holds him up. He tells Geryon, ""now move thee! be thy wheeling gyres of ample circuit, easy thy descent. Think on th' unusual burden thou sustain'st.""
Geryon loosens from the land, turns its forked tail where its breast had been, and steers like an eel, gathering air with retractable claws. The protagonist's dread is immense, greater than Phaeton or Icarus's falls, as he sees only the ""fell beast"" and air around him. Geryon slowly sails downward, unnoticed by the protagonist, except for the wind from below. The protagonist hears a hideous crash of the cataract on their right. Bending down to explore, he conceives new terror at the steep plunge, seeing flames and hearing wailings, realizing their downward course is winding.
Geryon descends like a weary falcon, landing them at the base of the ""deep-furrow'd rock,"" discharges his burden, and springs forward like an arrow.

**CANTO XVIII**
They are now in Malebolge, a place in the depths of hell, ""all of rock dark-stain'd with hue ferruginous,"" encircling a spacious gulf. This region forms ten trenches in its hollow bottom, like fosses around a castle. Flinty paths advance from the rock's base, crossing moles and dikes to the gulf. Dislodged from Geryon's back, they are in this place. Virgil goes left, and the protagonist follows.
On their right, the protagonist sees ""new misery, new pains, new executioners of wrath,"" swarming in the first chasm. Naked sinners below come meeting them from the middle, passing them with a larger stride. The narrator compares this to Romans during Jubilee, managing crowds on a bridge.
He sees ""Horn'd demons... with lashes huge,"" smiting the sinners' backs, making them bound at the first stripe, none waiting for a second or third.
He spots one sinner and cries, ""Of him... not yet mine eye hath had his fill."" Virgil pauses, allowing him to walk backward and scan the spirit, who tries to hide. The protagonist exclaims, ""Thou who dost cast thy eye upon the ground, unless thy features do belie thee much, Venedico art thou."" He asks what brings him to this ""bitter seas'ning."" The spirit replies unwillingly, constrained by the protagonist's clear speech that recalls the world. He confesses he was Venedico, who ""led fair Ghisola to do the Marquis' will."" He adds that Bologna sends many barterers here, and they would rather say 'aye' for lucre than 'no'. If proof is needed, remember their craving thirst for gold.
A demon strikes him with his thong, exclaiming, ""Away! corrupter! here women are none for sale."" The protagonist rejoins Virgil, and they reach a rock that issued from the bank. They ascend it and turn right, departing from the ""eternal barriers.""
Arriving where the ""gaping arch lets pass the scourged souls,"" Virgil tells him to pause and observe these ""miserable others,"" faces not yet beheld, who have walked with them. From the old bridge, they eye a pack coming from the other side, excoriated by the lash. Virgil, unasked, identifies a ""lofty shade"" as Jason, who won the ram from Colchos. His passage to Lemnos led him to beguile Hypsipyle, a young virgin who had first beguiled the rest of the women (who had slain all their males). He left her impregnated and forlorn. This guilt condemns him, and Medea's injuries are avenged here. All who practiced similar deceit bear him company. This suffices for the first vale.
They then cross the next pier to another arch. In the second chasm, they hear ghosts jibbering ""in low melancholy sounds,"" snorting with ""wide-stretch'd nostrils,"" and smiting themselves with palms. A scurf of condensed foul steam hangs on the banks, combating sight and smell.
The depth is so hollow that nothing can be distinguished from above. They reach it, and the protagonist sees a crowd immersed in ""ordure, that appear'd draff of the human body."" He marks one with a grimed head, hard to discern if clerk or layman. The spirit cries, ""Why greedily thus bendest more on me, than on these other filthy ones, thy ken?""
The protagonist replies he has seen him with dry locks and he is Alessio of Lucca. The spirit replies his ""flatteries have sunk"" him thus low. Virgil points out ""that besotted, sluttish courtezan, who there doth rend her with defiled nails,"" identifying her as Thais, ""the harlot, whose false lip answer'd her doting paramour that ask'd, 'Thankest me much!'—'Say rather wondrously.'""

**CANTO XIX**
The narrator exclaims woe to Simon Magus and his followers who prostitute ""the things of God... for gold and silver in adultery,"" for theirs is the third chasm. They mount the following vault, where the rock impends over the center of the foss. The narrator marvels at Divine Wisdom.
He sees the ""livid stone"" full of apertures, all circular and equal in width, like baptismal fonts in Saint John's dome, one of which he once broke to save an infant. From each aperture, a sinner's feet and legs up to the calf emerge, the rest hidden beneath. Their soles are burning, causing their ""flexile joints"" to glance with violent motion. Flames glide from heel to point, scarcely touching.
The protagonist asks who the spirit is ""glancing in fiercer agony,"" on whom a ruddier flame preys. Virgil offers to carry him down to the least steep bank so the spirit can tell his story. The protagonist agrees.
They descend to the depth of the fourth pier, a narrow, perforated strait. Virgil sets him down at the orifice of the quivering limb. The protagonist addresses the ""sad spirit! thus revers'd, and as a stake driv'n in the soil,"" asking him to speak. He feels like a friar shriving a condemned murderer.
The spirit shouts, ""Ha! already standest there? Already standest there, O Boniface! By many a year the writing play'd me false. So early dost thou surfeit with the wealth, for which thou fearedst not in guile to take the lovely lady, and then mangle her?""
The protagonist is bewildered, but Virgil admonishes him to quickly say, ""I am not he, not he, whom thou believ'st."" The protagonist complies.
The spirit wrenches his feet and sighs woefully, asking what the protagonist requires. If it imports him to know his identity, he says he was ""rob'd in the mighty mantle"" and was ""the son of a she-bear,"" eager to advance his whelps, having ""stow'd"" his wealth above and himself here. He states that others, his predecessors in simony, are dragged beneath his head, and he will fall among them when the one for whom he mistook the protagonist arrives. He notes that he has stood ""Upturn'd with fiery feet"" longer than the coming one. After him, ""one yet of deeds more ugly shall arrive, from forth the west, a shepherd without law, fated to cover both his form and mine."" This new Jason will receive favor from ""France's monarch.""
The protagonist replies, asking what treasures Christ demanded of St. Peter when giving him the keys, noting he asked only ""Follow me!"" and neither Peter nor the others took gold or silver. He declares the spirit's punishment merited and warns him to ""look well to that ill-gotten coin."" He says if not for reverence for the keys, he would speak more severely. He blames their avarice for casting the world in mourning, treading good underfoot and raising bad men. He refers to the Evangelist who saw the ""whore who sits upon the waves, with kings in filthy whoredom."" He condemns them for making gold and silver their god. He attributes much ill to Constantine's ""plenteous dower,"" not his conversion.
As the protagonist speaks, the spirit, whether smitten by wrath or conscience, violently springs up, spinning on his soles. Virgil is pleased. He catches the protagonist in his arms, lifts him to his bosom, and retraces his descent. He carries him without weariness to the summit of the rock, their passage from the fourth to the fifth pier. He gently places his ""cherish'd burden"" on the rugged rock.
Thence, another vale appears.

**CANTO XX**
The narrator introduces the twentieth canto about new torments. He looks into the depth, moistened with tears, and sees a tribe weeping silently, walking along the hollow vale like choirs chanting litanies.
He observes each spirit wondrously reversed at the neck-bone, their countenances averted from their reins, compelled to advance backward because they cannot look forward. He notes that one might be ""by force of palsy clean transpos'd,"" but he has never seen it.
The narrator addresses the reader, asking how he could keep his face dry seeing ""our form distorted in such guise, that on the hinder parts fall'n from the face the tears down-streaming roll'd."" He leans against a rock and weeps. Virgil exclaims, ""What, and art thou too witless as the rest? Here pity most doth show herself alive, when she is dead. What guilt exceedeth his, who with Heaven's judgment in his passion strives?""
Virgil tells him to raise his head and see Amphiaraus, before whose eyes earth gaped in Thebes, falling to Minos. He notes how Amphiaraus makes his breast his shoulders, and who once wished to see too far before him, now looks backward and treads reverse. He then points out Tiresias, ""who semblance chang'd, when woman he became of male,"" and then again became male by striking two entwining serpents with his rod.
Next comes Aruns, ""with more his belly facing,"" who dwelt in a cavern in Luni's mountains, from which he held a boundless view of stars and sea.
The next is Manto, whose ""loosen'd tresses overspread her bosom."" She searched many regions and fixed her seat in Virgil's ""native land."" He recounts her story: after her father's death, she wandered, then found a waste territory in a fen in Italy, where she remained, practicing her arts with her slaves, and lived and left her body. Tribes gathered to that strong place, enclosed by the fen, and built a city on her ""dead bones,"" calling it Mantua, for she first chose the spot. He warns the protagonist against any other origin story for his country.
The protagonist tells Virgil his words are certain. He asks if there are any other spirits ""that merit more especial note.""
Virgil identifies Eurypylus, whose beard sweeps over his shoulders, as the seer from Aulis who gave the sign to cut the cable when Greece was emptied of males. He says he sang of him in his ""tragic strain."" The other, ""so slender of his shape,"" was Michael Scot, skilled in magic.
He points out Guido Bonatti and Asdente, who now repents leaving his thread and cordwain. Next, he points to ""wretches, who the needle left, the shuttle and the spindle, and became diviners,"" working ""baneful witcheries with images and herbs.""
Virgil then notes it is time to move on, as Cain now confines with a fork of thorns on either hemisphere beneath Seville's towers. He reminds the protagonist the moon was round yesternight, which served him in the ""gloom of the deep wood."" They both move onward.

**CANTO XXI**
They pass from bridge to bridge with other talk not rehearsed in the drama, reaching the summit to view another gap in Malebolge with ""other bootless pangs."" The place is shrouded in ""Marvelous darkness.""
The narrator compares the scene to the Venetian arsenal where pitch boils in winter to smear unsound vessels. So, ""not by force of fire but art divine"" boils a ""glutinous thick mass,"" liming all the shore beneath. He sees nothing but the surge of the boiling.
Virgil exclaims, ""Mark! mark!"" and draws the protagonist away. The protagonist turns, seeing a ""devil black"" running along the rock, with fierce cruelty in his look, buoyant outstretched wings, and nimble feet. His shoulder is charged with a sinner, held by the haunch, gripping the foot's sinew fast.
The devil cries, ""Ye of our bridge! keen-talon'd fiends! Lo! one of Santa Zita's elders! Him whelm ye beneath, while I return for more."" He adds that the land (Lucca) has many such, all barterers except Bonturo, where ""of 'no' for lucre there an 'aye' is quickly made."" He dashes the sinner down and returns with eager haste. The sinner sinks, then rises writhing to the surface. The dark demons from beneath the bridge cry, ""Here the hallow'd visage saves not: here is other swimming than in Serchio's wave. Wherefore if thou desire we rend thee not, Take heed thou mount not o'er the pitch."" They grapple him with hooks, shouting, ""Cover'd thou must sport thee here; so, if thou canst, in secret mayst thou filch."" The narrator compares this to a cook thrusting meat into a cauldron with flesh-hooks.
Virgil tells the protagonist to hide behind a craggy rock lest they descry him, and not to fear any force or insult to Virgil, as he has been in similar frays. Virgil passes the bridge's head and reaches the sixth pier, showing a ""forehead terror-proof.""
The demons rush forth like dogs on a poor man, pointing their weapons at Virgil. Virgil cries, ""Be none of you outrageous: ere your time dare seize me, come forth from amongst you one, who having heard my words, decide he then if he shall tear these limbs."" They shout, ""Go, Malacoda!"" One advances, asking, ""What may this turn avail him?""
Virgil answers that he came so far ""without will divine and destiny propitious,"" for ""Heaven's pleasure is, that I should lead another through this savage wilderness."" Malacoda's pride falls, he drops his instrument of torture, and tells the rest they have ""no power to strike him."" Virgil tells the crouching protagonist to safely return to him.
The protagonist rises, moving with speed, fearing the fiends might break their compact. He compares this fear to infantry at Caprona fearing the foe might break a covenant. He adheres to Virgil, observing their ""unkindly visage."" The fiends speak of touching him on the hip, but Malacoda turns rapidly, saying, ""Stay, stay thee, Scarmiglione!""
Malacoda tells them that the rock offers no further footing because it is ""shiver'd to the base of the sixth arch."" But to proceed, they can go up ""by this cavern,"" where ""another rock will yield you passage safe."" He explains that yesterday, ""later by five hours than now, Twelve hundred threescore years and six had fill'd the circuit of their course, since here the way was broken."" He dispatches a troop of ten scouts, led by Barbariccia, to spy if any bask on the surface and to lead them safely where the other crag traverses the dens. He names them: Alichino, Calcabrina, Cagnazzo, Libicocco, Draghinazzo, Ciriatto (fanged), Graffiacane, Farfarello, and Rubicant.
The protagonist expresses fear, asking Virgil if they should journey alone without escort, as the fiends gnarl and threaten tortures. Virgil reassures him not to fear, saying it is only a token of their spite against the tormented souls.
The fiends turn left over the pier, each pressing his tongue between his teeth, looking for a signal from their leader, who gives it with an ""obscene triumphant"" sound.

**CANTO XXII**
The narrator recalls having seen cavalry in martial order, but never such a strange formation as the ten demons moving with them. He calls it ""fearful company.""
He gazes at the pitch to mark everything within the chasm. Like dolphins showing their backs to warn mariners, some sinners show their backs to ease pain, then hide. Like frogs at the brink of a moat with only their jaws out, the sinners stand, but soon as Barbariccia approaches, they hide under the wave. The protagonist sees one sinner who waits. Graffiacan, the nearest fiend, seizes his ""clotted locks"" and drags him up, making him appear like an otter. The narrator knew their names from when they were chosen. The cursed crew shouts, ""O Rubicant! See that his hide thou with thy talons flay.""
The protagonist asks Virgil what wretched soul this is. Virgil approaches and asks where he comes from. The spirit replies he was born in Navarre, placed in a lord's retinue by his mother (who bore him to a vile spendthrift). He served King Thibault, then turned to ""peculating,"" for which he now gives account in this heat.
Ciriatto, with tusks like a boar, rips him. Barbariccia seizes the sinner with both arms, crying, ""Stand thou apart, while I do fix him on my prong transpierc'd."" He tells Virgil to inquire further before the sinner is rent again. Virgil asks about his partners in guilt from Latian land under the tar. The sinner replies he just parted from one nearby and wishes he were with him, safe from hooks and talons.
Libicocco cries, ""Too long we suffer,"" and seizes the sinner's arm with a prong, mangling the sinewy part. Draghinazzo attempts to catch his thighs, but Barbariccia angrily restrains them. When the strife ceases, Virgil asks about the spirit from whom he parted.
The sinner replies it was ""the friar Gomita,"" from Gallura, a ""vessel of all guile,"" who had his master's enemies in hand and used them well, taking money to dismiss them. He ""play'd the part of barterer to the height"" in all charges. Michel Zanche, chief of Logodoro, herds with him. Sardinia is a theme they never tire of. The sinner points out another who grins and expresses fear of being mauled.
Barbariccia rebukes Farfarello, who rolls his ""moony eyes in act to strike,"" crying, ""Off! cursed bird! Avaunt!""
The sinner, quaking, offers to make Tuscan or Lombard spirits appear if the fiends ""bate their fury."" He promises to make seven appear with his whistle, as it is their custom to call each other. Cagnazzo grins deridingly, saying it's a mischievous device to plunge him down. The sinner replies it would only bring him more woe.
Alichino, gainsaying the rest, says if the sinner casts himself down, he will pursue him above the pitch with his plumes. He suggests they quit the vantage ground and let the bank be a shield to see if the sinner can prevail alone.
The narrator invites the reader to expect new sport. The fiends turn their eyes to the other shore. The Navarrese spirit, choosing his time well, plants his feet on land and leaps, escaping them. Quick resentment stings the fiends, especially Alichino, who pursues him, exclaiming, ""Thou art caught."" But terror outstrips his flight. The sinner plunges beneath the pitch, and Alichino, with upward pinion, raises his breast. The narrator compares this to a waterfowl diving from a falcon.
This mockery angers Calcabrina, who flies after Alichino and turns his talons on his comrade for the escape. They grapple over the dyke and fall into the boiling lake. The heat becomes umpire, and their glued plumes prevent them from lifting themselves. Barbariccia, lamenting, dispatches four fiends from the other coast to their posts, armed with hooks, to retrieve the struggling fiends. They leave them to their broil.

**CANTO XXIII**
They proceed in silence, one first, the other following, like minor friars. The recent fray makes the narrator muse on Aesop's fable of the mouse and frog, noting the similarity in sense between the events. This thought leads to another, doubling his fear: the fiends, foiled and mocked, will pursue them more fiercely than a hound chasing a leveret.
His hair stands on end, and he looks back. He tells Virgil to hide them quickly from the ""evil talons"" that seem to urge them from behind, as imagination works so powerfully he already feels them.
Virgil replies that his thoughts are already presented before his own, similar in act and countenance, so he has formed one design. If the right coast inclines enough to descend into the other chasm, they will escape this ""imagined pursuit.""
Before he finishes, the narrator sees the fiends approaching with spread wings. Virgil suddenly catches him ""ev'n as a mother"" awakened by fire snatches her babe and flies. He casts himself supine down from the jutting beach to a pendent rock that closes one part of the chasm.
Virgil runs along the edge with hurrying pace, carrying the narrator in his bosom. Scarcely have his feet reached the lowest bed when the fiends reach the steep above them. But Virgil feels no fear, for high Providence, which placed them as ministers of the fifth foss, took from them the power of departing thence.
In the depth, they see a ""painted tribe,"" pacing slowly, weeping, faint and toiled. They wear caps with hoods like Cologne monks, overlaid with dazzling gold but leaden within, of such weight that Frederick's were straw by comparison. The narrator exclaims at the ""everlasting wearisome attire!""
They turn left with the spirits, intent on their dismal moan. The fainting people move so slowly that their company changes at every step. The narrator asks Virgil to find a spirit whose name is known by his deeds.
One spirit, understanding Tuscan, cries out to them to stop. Virgil tells the narrator to pause and proceed at their pace. The narrator waits and sees two spirits eager to overtake him, but their load and the narrow path retard them.
Arriving, they eye him askance, then one asks the other, ""This one seems, by the action of his throat, alive. And, be they dead, what privilege allows they walk unmantled by the cumbrous stole?"" Then to the narrator: ""Tuscan, who visitest the college of the mourning hypocrites, disdain not to instruct us who thou art.""
The narrator replies he was bred in Florence by the Arno and wears the body he has ever worn. He asks who they are, suffering such grief. One answers that their ""bonnets gleaming bright with orange hue"" are so ""leaden gross, that with their weight they make the balances to crack beneath them."" They were ""Joyous friars,"" natives of Bologna, Catalano (the speaker) and Loderingo, taken by Florence as arbitrators to reconcile strifes. Gardingo's vicinage can best declare how they fared.
The narrator begins to speak of their miseries, but is interrupted by seeing one fixed to a cross with three stakes. This spirit writhes and sighs deeply. Catalano points out that this ""pierced spirit"" was Caiaphas, who advised the Pharisees that one man should suffer for the people. He lies transverse, and everyone who passes must make ""feeling trial how each weighs"" on him. The father of his consort and others in that council are placed in similar straits. The narrator notes Virgil gazing with wonder at Caiaphas.
Virgil asks the friar if there is an opening on their right to leave without constraint on the dark angels. The friar replies that ""Nearer than thou dost hope, there is a rock from the next circle moving, which o'ersteps each vale of horror, save that here his cope is shatter'd. By the ruin ye may mount: For on the side it slants, and most the height rises below."" Virgil stands with head bent, then says, ""He warn'd us ill, Who yonder hangs the sinners on his hook."" The friar adds that at Bologna, he heard many vices of the devil, including ""He is a liar, and the father of lies!""
Virgil proceeds with large strides, somewhat disturbed by anger. The narrator leaves the ""spirits heavy laden"" and follows his footsteps.

**CANTO XXIV**
In the early part of the year, when the sun is in Aquarius and nights recede towards equal day, the rime whitens the plain. A village hind, lacking winter stores, at first laments, then finds new hope as the world changes, and drives his flock to pasture. Similarly, the protagonist was disheartened by Virgil's troubled forehead, but that ill was quickly cured. At the fallen bridge, Virgil turns back with a sweet look. Regarding the ruin, and after internal counsel, he opens his arms and lifts the protagonist. Like a workman calculating his labor, Virgil lifts him to one peak, then fixes his eye on another, telling him to ""Grapple that... but first make proof, if it be such as will sustain thee.""
The narrator notes this would be no journey for one capped with lead. Scarcely could he, though light, and the protagonist, though pushed from crag to crag, mount. If this precinct were not less ample than the last, his strength would have failed. Malebolge, inclining toward the mouth of the nethermost abyss, requires each valley to slope upward on one side and fall on the other.
They reach the point of descent from the last flag, and the protagonist is so exhausted he must sit. Virgil tells him to ""Now needs thy best of man,"" for fame is not won on downy plumes or under canopies. Without fame, one leaves ""such vestige of himself on earth, as smoke in air or foam upon the wave."" He urges him to rise, banish weariness by mind's effort, as a ""longer ladder yet remains to scale.""
The protagonist rises, appearing less spent than he feels, and cries, ""On, for I am stout and fearless."" They hold their way up the rock, more rugged, narrower, and steeper than before. The protagonist talks ceaselessly to appear less faint. A voice from the other foss issues forth, ""for utt'rance suited ill."" Though standing on the arch, he cannot understand the words, but the speaker seems angry. He stoops but cannot see the depth for darkness. He asks Virgil to bend their steps to the next circle and dismount from the wall. Virgil replies, ""I answer not... but by the deed. To fair request silent performance maketh best return.""
They descend from the bridge's head to the eighth mound, and the chasm opens to view. Inside, the protagonist sees a crowd of ""serpents terrible, so strange of shape and hideous, that remembrance in my veins yet shrinks the vital current."" He dismisses Libya's boast of snakes, saying it never showed such plagues in numbers or direness.
Amidst this ""dread exuberance of woe,"" naked spirits run, ""wing'd with horrid fear,"" with no hope of hiding. Serpents bind their hands behind them, their tails and heads twisted in folds before their reins. An adder darts onto one near them, transpiercing him where the neck joins the shoulders. Quicker than a pen writes O or I, the spirit kindles, burns, and changes to ashes. The dust then spontaneously re-rolls and instantly resumes the same form. The narrator compares this to the Arabian Phoenix. The sinner rises aghast.
The narrator remarks on God's severe judgment. Virgil asks who the spirit is. He replies, ""Vanni Fucci am I call'd, not long since rained down from Tuscany to this dire gullet."" He states the ""bestial life and not the human pleas'd,"" a mule from Pistoia.
The protagonist asks Virgil to make him stay and ask his crime, recalling him as a ""choleric and bloody"" man. The sinner hears and, with dismal shame depicted on his face, says it grieoves him more to be caught by the protagonist in this sad plight than when he was taken from life. He is doomed here for having robbed the sacristy of its ornaments and falsely charged another. To ensure the protagonist does not joy in his suffering, he forebodes what will happen: Pistoia will pine, reft of the Neri; Florence will change citizens and laws. A vapor, drawn by Mars, will rise from Valdimagra, wrapped in turbid mists, and drive a storm with ""arrowy hurtling o'er Piceno's field,"" bursting suddenly to strike ""Each helpless Bianco prostrate to the ground."" He tells this to rend the protagonist's heart.

**CANTO XXV**
After speaking, the sinner raises his hands in mockery, crying, ""Take them, God! I level them at thee!"" From that day, the serpents are the narrator's friends, as one twists around the sinner's neck, as if saying, ""Be silent, tongue!"" Another glides up his arms, tying them.
The narrator exclaims, ""Pistoia! Ah Pistoia! why dost doubt to turn thee into ashes?"" He did not mark any spirit swelling so proudly against God, not even the one who fell headlong from Thebes. The sinner fled, uttering no more. A centaur, Cacus, full of fury, comes after him, shouting, ""Where, where is the caitiff?"" Serpents swarm on his haunch up to his human face. Behind his head on his shoulders is a dragon breathing fire. Virgil identifies him as Cacus, who spread a ""lake of blood"" beneath Aventine rock. He is parted from his brethren here for his ""fraudful theft of the great herd,"" which ended under Hercules' mace.
While Virgil speaks, the centaur speeds away. Three spirits come up from below, unnoticed until they exclaim, ""Say who are ye?"" They break off discourse. The protagonist doesn't know them, but one names another, ""Where doth Cianfa lurk?"" The protagonist puts a finger to his lips, signaling Virgil to be attentive. The narrator addresses the reader, saying it's no marvel if they don't believe, for he himself scarcely trusts his eyes.
As he looks, a six-footed serpent springs onto one spirit, fastening itself on him: its middle grasps the belly, a forefoot seizes each arm, fangs flesh deep in cheeks, and hinder feet spread on thighs, tail curled on reins. The monster intertwines with the spirit like ivy on an oak. Both melt into each other like burning wax, mingling hues, so neither is seen anymore. The narrator describes it like browning paper before burning. The other two exclaim, ""Ah, how dost thou change, Agnello! See! Thou art nor double now, nor only one."" The two heads become one, two figures blend into one form, losing both original shapes. Two arms are made from four lengths, belly, chest, thighs, and legs change into unseen members. All trace of former shape vanishes. The miscreated image passes on with tardy steps.
Like a lizard darting across a road, an adder, all on fire, approaches the entrails of the other two spirits. It transpierces one where life is first nourished, and the spirit falls stretched out. The pierced spirit looks at the serpent, both breathing thick smoke that joins.
The narrator says Lucan and Ovid may now be mute, for they never sang of two natures transmuted face to face. In mutual guise, the serpent splits its tail to a fork, and the pierced spirit draws his legs and thighs together, making no sign of juncture. The disparted tail takes the spirit's lost figure, its skin softening, while the spirit's indurates to a rind. Shoulders join the monster's armpits, its two shorter feet lengthen as the other's shrink. The feet behind twist up to form the part man conceals, which in the wretch (the spirit) was cleft in twain. As the smoke veils both with new color, one body grows an excrescent pile, while the other peels it off. One rises upright, the other falls prone. Their ""glaring and malignant lamps"" (eyes) are not shifted, though features change. The standing one's face retreats to temples, superfluous matter forms ears, the nose swells, and lips protrude. The one on the earth extends his sharpened visage, drawing ears into his head like a slug its horns. His tongue, continuous and apt for utterance, severs, while the other's fork closes and unites. The smoke then dissipates. The soul transformed into the brute glides off, hissing. The other, now talking, sputters and turns his new-grown shoulders on him, speaking to another, ""Along this path crawling, as I have done, speed Buoso now!""
The narrator saw the ""unsteady ballast of the seventh hold"" fluctuate in change. He attributes any linguistic swerving to the strangeness of events. Confusion and amaze hang over his eyes and thoughts.
Yet they did not escape so covertly that he failed to mark Sciancato, the only one of the three first who did not change. He mentions Gaville still rues the other's fate.

**CANTO XXVI**
The narrator addresses Florence, exulting in its might across land and sea, spreading its name even in hell. He found three of its citizens among the plunderers, bringing shame to him and no honor to the city. He prophesies Florence will soon feel the woes that Prato wishes upon it, saying it would be good if it happened now, for he will grieve more as time passes.
They depart the depth, Virgil scaling the flinty steps they previously descended, pulling the protagonist up. They proceed on their solitary way among crags and splinters, needing hands as well as feet.
Sorrow seizes the narrator as he recalls what he saw, and he curbs his nature's powers to avoid running where virtue guides not, valuing the good his star or something better gave him.
Like a peasant seeing innumerable fire-flies spangling the vale at sunset, the narrator sees the eighth chasm shining with ""flames so numberless,"" when the depth is exposed. Like the one whose wrongs bears avenged, seeing Elijah's chariot rise, his eyes straining until only a misty speck of flame remains, so moves every flame along the gulf, each enclosing a sinner so closely that ""none exhibits token of the theft.""
The narrator leans forward on the bridge to look, grasping a flinty mass lest he fall. Virgil, noting his gaze, explains that ""Within these ardours are the spirits, each swath'd in confining fire."" The narrator says he believes this, but wonders who is in the ""horned flame"" that seems parted at the summit, like the Theban brothers' funeral pile. Virgil replies, ""Ulysses there and Diomede endure their penal tortures, thus to vengeance now together hasting, as erewhile to wrath."" They deplore the ambush of the horse (Trojan Horse), which opened a portal for the seed that sowed imperial Rome, and the guile that reft Achilles from Deidamia, who still complains in death. They also rue the stratagem that despoiled Troy of her Palladium.
The narrator asks if they can speak from within the sparks, begging Virgil to pause until the horned flame arrives. Virgil praises his prayer and accepts it, but tells him to refrain his tongue, as he will question them, divining the protagonist's wish, and they, being Greeks, might shun discourse with him.
When the flame arrives, Virgil asks, ""O ye, who dwell two spirits in one fire! If living I of you did merit aught... move ye not on, till one of you unfold in what clime death o'ertook him self-destroy'd.""
The greater horn of the old flame begins to roll, murmuring like fire with wind, then wags its top like a tongue, speaking. It says that after escaping Circe, who held him for a year near Caieta, neither fondness for his son, reverence for his father, nor Penelope's love could overcome his ""zeal... t' explore the world, and search the ways of life, man's evil and his virtue."" He sailed into the ""deep illimitable main"" with one bark and a small band. He saw both shores as far as Iberia and Morocco, and Sardinia and other islands. He and his companions were old when they reached the ""strait pass, where Hercules ordain'd the bound'ries not to be o'erstepp'd by man."" He left Seville's walls to his right, and Ceuta already past.
He addressed his brothers, urging them, having reached ""through perils without number"" the ""short remaining watch"" of their senses, not to refuse proof ""of the unpeopled world, following the track of Phoebus."" He reminded them they were ""not form'd to live the life of brutes but virtue to pursue and knowledge high."" These words sharpened their minds, making them unstoppable. They turned their poop to the dawn and used their oars as wings, gaining on the left. They saw the stars of the other pole, and theirs so low it rose not from the ocean. Five times the moon's light had re-illumined and vanished since they entered the deep way. Then, from afar, a dim mountain appeared, the loftiest he ever beheld. Joy seized them, but quickly changed to mourning. A whirlwind sprung from the new land, striking the vessel's foremost side. It whirled her thrice, the fourth time lifting the poop and sinking the prow, as fate decreed. ""And over us the booming billow clos'd.""

**CANTO XXVII**
The flame rises, stilling its light after speaking, then passes on with Virgil's leave. Another flame follows, from whose top a confused sound draws their eyes.
The narrator compares it to the Sicilian bull bellowing from the tormented voice within, seeming pierced with pain. So the dismal words turn into language from the flame, speaking when they find passage. ""O thou! to whom I now direct my voice! That lately didst exclaim in Lombard phrase, 'Depart thou, I solicit thee no more,' Though somewhat tardy I perchance arrive, Let it not irk thee here to pause awhile, And with me parley: lo! it irks not me And yet I burn. If but e'en now thou fall into this blind world, from that pleasant land of Latium, whence I draw my sum of guilt, Tell me if those, who in Romagna dwell, Have peace or war. For of the mountains there was I, betwixt Urbino and the height, whence Tyber first unlocks his mighty flood.""
The narrator listens. Virgil touches his side, saying, ""Speak thou: he is a Latian."" The narrator replies that Romagna ""never was... without war in her proud tyrants' bosoms, nor is now."" He left no open war there; Ravenna's state is steadfast, with Polenta's eagle brooding, overshadowing Cervia. The ""green talons"" (Malatesta family) grasp the land that stood long against the host of France.
He continues describing other tyrants: the ""old mastiff of Verruchio and the young"" (Malatesta of Rimini) still make an auger of their fangs, having torn Montagna. Lamone's city and Santerno's range under the ""lion of the snowy lair"" (Ordelaffi of Forlì), an inconstant partisan. The city by Savio's wave (Cesena) lives ""betwixt tyrant power and liberty.""
He then asks the spirit who he is, entreating him not to be harder than others, so his name may ""rear its forehead high"" in the world.
The fire roars awhile, then its sharpened point waves, and it speaks: ""If I did think, my answer were to one, who ever could return unto the world, This flame should rest unshaken. But since ne'er, if true be told me, any from this depth has found his upward way, I answer thee, nor fear lest infamy record the words.""
He says he was ""a man of arms at first,"" then clothed himself ""in good Saint Francis' girdle, hoping so t' have made amends."" His hope would not have failed, but ""the high priest again seduc'd me into sin."" He explains that while alive, his deeds bespoke the nature ""of the lion than the fox,"" knowing ""winding subtlety"" that reached the world's limit. When he reached the point in life to ""lower sails and gather in the lines,"" he rued his past and turned to repentance and confession.
Meanwhile, the ""chief of the new Pharisees"" (Pope Boniface VIII), waging war near the Lateran not against Saracens or Jews but Christians, revered neither his charge nor the cord of Francis. Like Constantine seeking Sylvester's aid for leprosy, this man (Boniface) sought him to cure ""the fever of his pride,"" asking for counsel. The spirit was silent, for Boniface's words ""seem'd drunken."" But Boniface resumed, ""From thy heart banish fear: of all offence I hitherto absolve thee. In return, Teach me my purpose so to execute, that Penestrino cumber earth no more. Heav'n, as thou knowest, I have power to shut and open: and the keys are therefore twain.""
Yielding to these ""forceful arguments,"" deeming silence more perilous, he answered, ""Father! since thou washest me clear of that guilt wherein I now must fall, Large promise with performance scant, be sure, Shall make thee triumph in thy lofty seat."" (This refers to giving Boniface counsel on how to take the city of Penestrino by promising mercy then breaking it).
He continues: when he died, Saint Francis came for him, but a ""cherub dark"" met him, crying, ""Wrong me not; he is mine, and must below to join the wretched crew, For the deceitful counsel which he gave."" The cherub explains that ""No power can the impenitent absolve; Nor to repent and will at once consist, By contradiction absolute forbid."" The spirit recounts how the cherub seized him and bore him to Minos, who ""Twin'd eight times round his callous back the tail, Which biting with excess of rage, he spake: 'This is a guilty soul, that in the fire must vanish.'"" Hence, the spirit now roves ""A prey to rankling sorrow in this garb.""
The flame then parts in dolour, writhing its sharp horn. The narrator and Virgil go onward, up along the rock, to another arch overhanging the foss where others pay for committed sin.

**CANTO XXVIII**
The narrator despairs of words to fully tell of the wounds and blood he now sees in the ninth chasm, which surpasses in horror any historical massacre. A ""rundlet"" (cask) does not gape so wide as one spirit he sees, torn from chin to ""hinder passage,"" with entrails dangling, midriff, and ventricle open to view.
The mangled spirit eyes the narrator, bares his breast, and cries, ""Now mark how I do rip me! lo! How is Mohammed mangled! before me walks Ali weeping, from the chin his face cleft to the forelock."" He explains that all the others here ""did sow scandal and schism, and therefore thus are rent."" A fiend hacks them cruelly with a sword, slivering them again after their gashes close when they complete their round. He asks the narrator why he stands musing, delaying his sentenced pain.
Virgil replies that death has not yet overtaken the narrator, nor does sin conduct him to torment. Virgil, who is dead, guides him through hell ""to make full trial of your state.""
More than a hundred spirits stop, amazed, to mark the narrator, forgetting their pains. Mohammed, with foot raised to depart, warns the narrator to ""Bear this warning to Dolcino: bid him, if he wish not here soon to follow me, that with good store of food he arm him, lest impris'ning snows yield him a victim to Novara's power.""
Another shade, pierced in the throat, mutilated nostrils, and lopt ear, advances, baring his windpipe, smeared with crimson. He asks the narrator, if he returns to the ""pleasant land"" of Latium, to remember Piero of Medicina and instruct ""the twain, whom Fano boasts her worthiest sons, Guido and Angelo,"" that they will be ""cast forth, and whelm'd under the waves near to Cattolica, through perfidy of a fell tyrant."" He describes this as a foul injury. The ""one-ey'd traitor"" (Malatestino, whom another spirit here wished were blind) will bring them to conference and so shape their end that they will not need to pray against Focara's wind.
The narrator asks who the one is whose sight awakens such sad remembrance. The spirit lays his hand on another's cheek-bone, expanding his jaws, crying, ""Lo! this is he I wot of; He speaks not for himself: the outcast this who overwhelm'd the doubt in Caesar's mind, Affirming that delay to men prepar'd Was ever harmful."" The narrator notes how terrified Curio seemed, whose tongue was cut out. Then one, maimed of each hand, lifts his bleeding stumps, sullied with gory spots, and cries, ""Remember thee of Mosca, too, I who, alas! exclaim'd, 'The deed once done there is an end,' that prov'd A seed of sorrow to the Tuscan race."" The narrator adds, ""Ay, and death to thine own tribe."" The spirit then hurries off, grief-stung.
The narrator lingers to behold the troop, seeing things he fears to tell of without more proof, but conscience makes him firm. He sees a headless trunk, pacing onward, bearing its severed head in hand ""lantern-wise pendent,"" which looks at them and says, ""Woe's me!"" The spirit thus lights himself, being ""two... in one, and one in two."" How that can be, only God knows. When he stands at the bridge's foot, he raises his arm, thrusting the head into view, so they might hear his words: ""Now behold this grievous torment, thou, who breathing go'st to spy the dead; behold if any else be terrible as this."" To bear tidings of him on earth, he identifies himself: ""I am Bertrand, he of Born, who gave King John the counsel mischievous. Father and son I set at mutual war."" He compares his act to Ahitophel spurring Absalom and David. For parting those ""so closely knit,"" he carries his brain ""parted, alas! from its source, that in this trunk inhabits."" Thus, the law of retribution works in him.

**CANTO XXIX**
The narrator's eyes are so ""inebriate with view of the vast multitude, whom various wounds disfigur'd"" that he longs to stay and weep. Virgil rouses him, asking why he still gazes ""among the maim'd and miserable shades."" He states the valley winds ""two and twenty miles"" and the moon is already beneath their feet, so time is short.
The narrator replies that if Virgil knew the cause of his looking, he would excuse the tarrying. He follows Virgil, adding that he believes ""a spirit dwells, one of my blood, wailing the crime that costs him now so dear,"" in the cave where he fixed his ken.
Virgil tells him not to afflict his soul, but to direct his thought elsewhere. He saw him point menacingly at the narrator at the bridge's foot, and heard him named Geri of Bello. The narrator was so busy with Bertrand de Born that he did not see Geri leave. The narrator explains that Geri's ""violent death yet unaveng'd"" by his kin made him contemptuous, hence he passed him speechless, making the narrator more compassionate.
They discourse to where the rock first showed the other valley, which would have had more light if it were not for the darkness. They reach the last cloister in Malebolge's dismal rounds, and a ""sore lament"" assails him, headed with ""points of thrilling pity,"" forcing him to close his ears.
The torment is compared to all the maladies of Valdichiana's lazar-houses, Sardinia, and Maremma's fen heaped in one foss, with a dire stench.
They descend to the utmost shore of the long rock, still to the left. His sight is livelier to explore the depth, where ""All-searching Justice"" dooms forgers. The narrator thinks it was not more rueful to see Aegina's nation droop from pestilence (restored from ant seeds as bards told) than to see these spirits languishing in the murky vale, piled on stacks. They lie confused, one over another, some crawling sidelong.
They journey step by step, observing and listening to the diseased, who struggle to lift their forms. He sees two sitting propped against each other like brazen pans, barked from head to foot with tetter. They quickly ply their nails through ""furiousness of ne'er abated pruriency,"" drawing off crust in flakes like scales from fish.
Virgil asks one, who rends his ""coat of proof"" with his fingers, if any Latian-born are among them. The spirit, weeping, replies both are from Latium and asks who Virgil is. Virgil replies he descends with a living man to show him hell's abyss.
They start asunder and turn trembling towards them. Virgil tells the narrator to speak what he wishes. The narrator asks them to tell who they are and their race, so their remembrance may not be lost in the upper world, despite their ""unseemly and disgustful"" punishment.
One answers he was from Arezzo, brought to die by fire by Albero of Sienna. But what he died for does not bring him here. He admits telling Albero in sport that he could fly, and Albero, admiring and void of wisdom, wished to know his art. Only because he did not make him a Daedalus, Albero prevailed on one ""suppos'd his sire to burn me."" Minos doomed him to this chasm, last of the ten, for practicing alchemy on earth.
The narrator asks Virgil if any race is as light as Sienna's, suggesting even France cannot show such a frivolous tribe. The other leprous spirit hears and replies, ""Be Stricca from this charge exempted, he who knew so temp'rately to lay out fortune's gifts; and Niccolo who first the spice's costly luxury discover'd in that garden, where such seed roots deepest in the soil."" He also exempts Caccia of Asciano's troop who lavished vineyards and woods, and Abbagliato who showed ""rare wisdom."" To know who seconds him against the Siennese, he tells the narrator to look closely, for he is Capocchio's ghost, who ""forg'd transmuted metals by the power of alchemy."" He knows the narrator must remember how he aped ""creative nature by my subtle art.""

**CANTO XXX**
The narrator recalls the frenzy of Athamas, driven by Juno's resentment, who dashed his son Learchus on a rock and caused his spouse to plunge. He also recalls Hecuba, distraught after Polyxena's slaughter and finding Polydorus, running barking like a dog. He states that Furies never showed such cruelty as he now sees in two ""pale and naked ghosts"" scampering wildly like swine. One reaches Capocchio, sticking his fangs deep in his neck-joint, dragging him. The other, from Arezzo, left trembling, says the other is ""Schicchi,"" who still vents his spite in ""random mischief.""
The narrator asks the trembling spirit to identify the other before it speeds away. He replies that it is ""the ancient soul of wretched Myrrha,"" who burned with unholy flame for her own father, assuming a false shape to commit the sin. The other, who passes onward, ""dar'd to counterfeit Donati's features, to feign'd testament the seal affixing, that himself might gain, For his own share, the lady of the herd.""
When the two furious shades vanish, the narrator turns to other cursed spirits. He sees one shaped like a lute, if the groin were severed. Swollen by dropsy, his limbs disproportionate, his paunch not suiting his visage, he gasps with wide lips.
He addresses the narrator, ""O ye, who in this world of misery, wherefore I know not, are exempt from pain,"" asking him to regard Adamo's woe. Adamo states he lacked nothing in life, but now craves ""one drop of water."" The rills of Casentino, flowing to the Arno, are always in his view, drying him up more than his disease. Justice, from the place of his transgression, quickens his sighs. He says he falsified metal with the Baptist's form in Romena, for which his body was burned on earth. He wishes to see Guido, Alessandro, or their brother, and would not exchange that sight for Branda's spring. One, he says, is already within, if the mad spirits tell truly, but his limbs are fettered. If he could move an inch every hundred years, he would seek him. He was brought among this tribe because they induced him to stamp florens with three carats of alloy.
The narrator asks about the ""abject pair"" smoking closely to his right. Adamo replies he found them there when he dropped into the gulf, and they will not turn until time runs its course. One is ""the false accuser of the Hebrew youth"" (Potiphar's wife, here Hecuba or Sinon's wife, but actually Potiphar's wife); the other is Sinon, ""that false Greek from Troy."" Sharp fever drains their moisture, steaming up a cloud.
One of the two, perhaps galled by the name, strikes Adamo on the paunch, which resounds like a drum. Adamo returns the blow. Sinon says Adamo's ""o'erweighty limbs"" may prevent movement, but he has an arm for such employ. Adamo replies he did not have it so ready when he went to the fire, but readier when he coined ""th' impostor gold."" Sinon retorts that Adamo speaks true, but he ""gav'st not such true testimony"" at Troy. Adamo tells the ""perjur'd one"" to remember the horse that ""did teem with death."" Sinon returns the accusation, citing Adamo's thirst and ""fluid mound"" (dropsy). Adamo calls Sinon's mouth wide to ""let pass its evil saying."" He admits thirst, but is ""stuff'd with moisture,"" while Sinon is parched, his head racked, needing no urging to ""lap Narcissus' mirror up.""
The narrator is fixed on listening, when Virgil admonishes, ""Now beware: a little more, and I do quarrel with thee."" The narrator perceives Virgil's anger and turns to him with such shame that it still confounds him. He feels like one who dreams of harm and wishes it were a dream, wanting to excuse himself but unable.
Virgil tells him, ""More grievous fault than thine has been, less shame, might expiate."" He tells him to cast all sorrow from his soul and, if he encounters such a conference again, to remember Virgil is at his side, as ""To hear such wrangling is a joy for vulgar minds.""

**CANTO XXXI**
The tongue that wounded him now ministers cure. The narrator recalls Achilles' javelin causing pain and then health.
They turn their back on the ""vale of woe"" and cross the mound in dim twilight. He hears a loud horn sound, making thunder feeble. His eyes strain to the sound, which Orlando did not blow so terribly when Charlemagne's host was overthrown. He sees ""many lofty towers"" and asks Virgil what land it is. Virgil replies he has erred in imagining, as his eye had too much ""intervening darkness"" to traverse. They will see how distance deludes the sense.
Virgil gently takes his hand, saying these are not towers but giants, immersed in the pit from their navel downward around the bank. As fog disperses, revealing objects, so his error flees and fear comes over him as they near the brink. He compares the turreted shore to Montereggion.
He sees the face, shoulders, breast, and part of the huge belly of one giant, with arms along his ribs. He reflects on nature's wisdom in framing these monsters, slaves for war, and how her wisdom is greater in the elephant and whale, for when ""brute force and evil will are back'd with subtlety, resistance none avails."" The giant's visage is as long and bulky as Saint Peter's pine. Three Friezelanders could not reach his hair. He is exposed thirty ample palms from where a man loops his garments.
The giant shouts, ""Raphel bai ameth sabi almi."" Virgil addresses him as ""O senseless spirit! let thy horn for thee interpret: therewith vent thy rage."" He tells him to search his neck for the belt that binds his horn and notes the ""baldrick"" hanging on his breast. Virgil tells the protagonist, ""He doth accuse himself. Nimrod is this, through whose ill counsel in the world no more one tongue prevails. But pass we on, nor waste our words; for so each language is to him, as his to others, understood by none.""
Turning leftward, they speed forth and find another ""far fiercer and more huge"" shade a sling's throw away. The narrator cannot say who had girt him, but his right arm is fettered behind, and the other with a chain from neck down, meeting five times around his form. Virgil says this proud one ""would of his strength against almighty Jove make trial,"" hence his requital. They call him Ephialtes, mighty when giants brought fear on gods, but now his arms move never. The protagonist wishes to see Briareus. Virgil says they will see Antaeus, who speaks and is unfettered, and will place them where ""guilt is at its depth."" Briareus, whom the protagonist wants to see, stands further on, in chains, ""like to this spirit, save that in his looks more fell he seems.""
Ephialtes shakes like a tower rocked by an earthquake, increasing the protagonist's dread, but he sees the cords holding him fast. They journey on to Antaeus, who issues from the cave ""five ells complete without the head.""
Virgil addresses Antaeus, recalling his strength in the valley that made Scipio heir of glory, and how he carried a hundred lions as spoil, and if he had fought with his brethren, men would believe the sons of earth conquered through him. Virgil asks him to place them down beneath where cold ""locks up Cocytus,"" not forcing them to crave Tityus' or Typhon's help. He says there is one (the protagonist) who can bestow renown on Antaeus in the upper world, for he lives and looks for longer life, ""if before the time Grace call him not unto herself.""
Antaeus swiftly stretches his hands and catches Virgil. Virgil, feeling the grapple, tells the protagonist to clasp him, then catches him up so they are both one burden. Antaeus appears like the leaning Carisenda tower, stooping. The narrator wished for another way, but Antaeus lightly places them in the abyss, ""that Lucifer with Judas low ingulfs,"" then rises like a stately mast.

**CANTO XXXII**
The narrator wishes for rough and hoarse rhymes to suit this ""hole of sorrow,"" for to describe the depth of the universe is not a jest and demands a mature tongue. He invokes the Muses. He calls the inhabitants ""ill-starr'd folk, beyond all others wretched.""
They stand in the dark pit beneath the giants' feet, but lower. A voice warns the narrator, ""Look how thou walkest. Take good heed, thy soles do tread not on the heads of thy poor brethren."" He turns and sees a lake whose frozen surface seems more like glass than water, thicker than the Danube or Tanais. If Tabernich or Pietrapana had fallen on it, ""not e'en its rim had creak'd."" Like frogs croaking above the wave, the spirits stand ""Blue pinch'd and shrin'd in ice,"" moving their teeth like storks, faces downward, expressing dolour with their eyes.
He sees two spirits so strictly joined that their hair is mingled. He asks who they are. They bend their necks, and their eyes, moist within, distill tears onto their lips, frozen between their orbs. They clash together ""like two enraged goats.""
One, whose ears are reft by the cold, exclaims, ""Why on us dost speculate so long?"" He identifies them: their father was Alberto, master of the valley where Bisenzio slopes, and they issued from one body. He says Caina holds no shade more worthy of congelation, not Arthur's foe, not Focaccia, nor Mascheroni (whose head obstructs his view). He identifies himself as Camiccione, awaiting his kinsman Carlino, whose ""deep guilt shall wash out mine.""
He then marks a thousand visages shaped into a ""doggish grin"" by the cold, causing shivering horror. As they journey toward the middle, the protagonist's foot violently strikes the face of one spirit.
The spirit weeps, ""Wherefore dost bruise me? Unless thy errand be some fresh revenge for Montaperto, wherefore troublest me?"" The protagonist asks Virgil to wait so he can rid himself of doubt. He then asks the spirit, who still curses him, who he is. The spirit asks who the protagonist is, roaming Antenora and smiting cheeks with such force.
The protagonist replies he is living, ""to thy joy perchance,"" if fame is dear to him, so he may enroll his name. The spirit retorts, ""The contrary of what I covet most... hence; nor vex me more. Ill knowest thou to flatter in this vale.""
The protagonist seizes his hair, crying, ""Name thee, or not a hair shall tarry here."" The spirit replies, ""Rend all away... yet for that I will not tell nor show thee who I am, Though at my head thou pluck a thousand times."" The protagonist pulls more than one tuft, and the spirit barks, eyes drawn in. Another spirit cries, ""What ails thee, Bocca? Sound not loud enough thy chatt'ring teeth, but thou must bark outright? What devil wrings thee?"" The protagonist tells Bocca he will bear ""true tidings"" of his shame. Bocca replies to tell what he lists, but to also speak of ""him whose tongue hath been so glib"" (Buera), who wails for French gold. He names Beccaria, Soldanieri, Ganellon, and Tribaldello (who opened Faenza).
They leave him. The narrator sees two spirits pent in one hollow, one's head a cowl to the other. The uppermost gnaws the other's brain where the spine joins, more furiously than Tydeus gnawed Menalippus. He asks the cause of such hate, on condition that if his grievance is warranted, he will repay him in the world above.

**CANTO XXXIII**
The sinner lifts his jaws from his repast, wipes them on the mangled hair of the head he was gnawing, then begins. He says obeying the protagonist's will calls up fresh sorrow. If his words can bear ""fruit of eternal infamy"" to the traitor he gnaws, the protagonist will see him speak and weep. He doesn't know who the protagonist is but recognizes him as Florentine. He identifies himself as Count Ugolino and the other as Archbishop Ruggieri. He explains that Ruggieri's ""ill thoughts"" led to his capture and murder. He will tell what the protagonist has not heard: ""How cruel was the murder.""
He describes a ""small grate"" in the mew (tower) named Famine, where others must still pine. Several moons had passed since he slept an ""evil sleep"" that tore the curtain off the future. He dreamed Ruggieri, as master of the sport, chased a gaunt wolf and its whelps (Ugolino and his sons) to the mountain that hides Lucca from Pisa. Lanfranchi, Sismondi, and Gualandi ranged before him with lean dogs. After a short course, the father and sons seemed tired, and he dreamed he saw sharp tusks gore their sides.
He awoke before dawn, hearing his sons (who were with him) weep and ask for bread. He addresses the reader, saying they are cruel if they feel no pang. The hour when food was brought drew near. The dream made them all misgive, and he heard the ""horrible tower"" locked beneath its outlet. He looked at his sons' visages, weeping not, feeling ""all stone within."" His sons wept, and little Anselm cried, ""Thou lookest so! Father what ails thee?"" He shed no tear nor answered that day or the next night. When a faint beam entered their ""doleful prison,"" and he saw his own image in four countenances, he bit his hands through agony. His sons, thinking he bit from hunger, rose and cried, ""Father, we should grieve far less, if thou wouldst eat of us: thou gav'st these weeds of miserable flesh we wear, And do thou strip them off from us again.""
To avoid making them sadder, he kept still. That day and the next, they were silent. He exclaims, ""Ah, obdurate earth! Why open'dst not upon us?"" On the fourth day, Geddo flung himself at his feet, crying, ""Hast no help for me, my father!"" He died. The narrator states he saw the three (other sons) fall one by one between the fifth and sixth days. Then, grown blind, he groped over them for three days, calling on them, until ""fasting got the mastery of grief.""
Having spoken, he fastens his teeth on the wretched skull again. The narrator exclaims against Pisa, shaming it, wishing Capraia and Gorgona would rise and dam the Arno's mouth so every soul in Pisa would perish. He argues that even if Ugolino betrayed castles, Pisa had no right to rack his children, Brigata, Ugaccione, and the two gentle ones, whose ""tender years"" made them ""Uncapable of guilt.""
They pass onward, where other spirits are ""skarf'd in rugged folds of ice,"" not on their feet, but reversed. Here, ""weeping suffers not to weep,"" for grief finds impediment at their eyes, turning inward for sharp anguish, tears hanging ""like crystal vizors.""
The narrator feels a breath of wind despite the cold. He asks Virgil the source, thinking all vapor is quenched. Virgil replies they will soon be where his eye will tell him the cause of this ""airy shower.""
One spirit in the cold crust cries out, ""O souls so cruel! that the farthest post hath been assign'd you, from this face remove the harden'd veil, that I may vent the grief impregnate at my heart, some little space ere it congeal again!"" The narrator replies he will help if the spirit tells who he was, promising to descend to the lowest ice if he fails.
The spirit answers, ""The friar Alberigo am I, who from the evil garden pluck'd its fruitage, and am here repaid, the date more luscious for my fig."" The narrator exclaims, ""Hah! Art thou too dead!"" Alberigo replies he is ignorant of his body's fate in the upper world. He explains that Ptolomea (this region) has the privilege that the soul often drops here before Atropos severs it. He says that the moment a soul betrays, its body is yielded to a fiend who moves and governs it until its time is rounded, while the soul falls headlong to this cistern. He adds that ""perchance above doth yet appear the body of a ghost, who here behind me winters,"" referring to Branca Doria, who came to this fastness many years ago.
The narrator expresses disbelief, saying Branca Doria is not dead but performs all natural functions. Alberigo replies that Michael Zanche had not yet reached the ""upper foss"" (of pitch) when Branca Doria left a demon in his stead in his own body, and one of his kin (who wrought treachery with him) also did so. Alberigo asks him to open his eyes. The narrator refuses, deeming ""Ill manners were best courtesy to him.""
The narrator then exclaims against the Genoese as perverse and foul, wondering why they are not canceled from earth, as he found one of them (Branca Doria) with Romagna's darkest spirit (Alberigo), already plunged in Cocytus in soul while seeming alive in body on earth.

**CANTO XXXIV**
Virgil points out, ""The banners of Hell's Monarch do come forth towards us; therefore look... if thou discern him."" The narrator sees what he thinks is a windmill in the distance, stirred briskly by the blast. He draws behind Virgil to shield himself from the wind.
He arrives where souls are whelmed underneath, transparent like glass, some prone, others upright, some arched face to feet. They reach the point where Virgil wishes him to see ""The creature eminent in beauty once."" Virgil steps aside and pauses, exclaiming, ""Lo! lo! behold Dis! and lo the place, where thou hast need to arm thy heart with strength.""
The narrator describes himself as frozen and faint, unable to express his state with words, ""not dead nor living."" He describes Lucifer, the emperor of sorrow, standing mid-breast from the ice, his stature so great that the narrator is more like a giant than the giants are in Lucifer's arms. He notes Lucifer's former beauty and his hideous present state, from which all misery flows.
Lucifer has ""three faces: one in front of hue vermilion, th' other two with this midway each shoulder join'd and at the crest; The right 'twixt wan and yellow seem'd: the left To look on, such as come from whence old Nile Stoops to the lowlands."" Under each face shoot two mighty wings, enormous like a bat's, without plumes. He flaps them, creating three winds that freeze Cocytus. He weeps from six eyes, tears distilling down three chins with bloody foam. At every mouth, his teeth champ a sinner, bruised as with a ponderous engine. The foremost sinner is tormented more by ""fierce rending,"" his back often stripped of skin. Virgil identifies the uppermost spirit, suffering worse punishment, as Judas, ""he that hath his head within and plies the feet without."" Of the other two, with heads under, the one hanging from the murky jaw is Brutus (who writhes and speaks not), and the other, ""large of limb,"" is Cassius. Virgil then says night re-ascends, and it is time for parting, as ""All is seen.""
The narrator clips Virgil around the neck as bade. Virgil, seeing the wings open enough, catches the ""shaggy sides,"" descending ""from pile to pile... between the thick fell and the jagged ice."" When they reach the point where the thigh turns on the haunches' swelling, Virgil, with pain and struggle, turns his head where his feet stood before, grappling at the fell, ""as one who mounts,"" making the narrator think they were turning back into hell.
Virgil, panting, says, ""Expect that by such stairs as these... We must depart from evil so extreme."" He issues forth at a ""rocky opening,"" places the narrator on a brink to sit, then joins him. The narrator raises his eyes, expecting to see Lucifer above, but sees him now ""With legs held upward."" The narrator reflects on the toil he felt at this point.
Virgil cries, ""Arise... The way is long, and much uncouth the road; And now within one hour and half of noon The sun returns."" They are not in a lofty palace but a natural dungeon with ill footing and scant light. The narrator, rising, asks Virgil, ""Where is now the ice? How standeth he in posture thus revers'd? And how from eve to morn in space so brief Hath the sun made his transit?""
Virgil explains: ""Thou deemest thou art still on th' other side the centre, where I grasp'd th' abhorred worm, that boreth through the world."" He clarifies that the narrator was on the other side as long as Virgil descended; when Virgil turned, the narrator ""didst o'erpass that point, to which from ev'ry part is dragg'd All heavy substance."" He is now ""under the hemisphere opposed to that, which the great continent doth overspread,"" where the sinless Man expired. His feet are planted on the ""smallest sphere,"" whose other aspect is Judecca. Morning rises here when evening sets there. Lucifer stands fixed as at first. He fell from heaven on this part, and the earth, prominent before, veiled herself with the sea through fear of him and retired to their hemisphere. Perhaps to shun him, the vacant space was left here by what firm land appears on this side, which sprang aloof.
There is a place beneath, as distant from Beelzebub as the vaulted tomb extends, discovered not by sight but by the sound of a brooklet descending a hollow rock. By that ""hidden way,"" Virgil and the narrator enter, to return to the ""fair world."" Heedless of repose, they climb, Virgil first, the narrator following, until ""the beautiful lights of heav'n dawn'd through a circular opening in the cave."" Thus, issuing, they ""again beheld the stars.""

**PURGATORY**

**CANTO I**
The narrator's ""light bark of my genius"" lifts sail, speeding over ""better waves,"" pleased to leave the ""cruel sea"" of Hell behind. He will now sing of the ""second region,"" where the human spirit is purged from sin and prepared for Heaven. He invokes the Muses and Calliope for aid.
A ""sweet hue of eastern sapphire"" spreads over the serene air, bringing him unwonted joy after escaping the ""deadly gloom"" of Hell. The radiant planet (Venus) makes the orient laugh, veiled beneath the Pisces' light.
He turns to the right and fixes his mind on the other pole, seeing ""Four stars ne'er seen before save by the ken of our first parents."" Heaven seems joyous from their rays. He laments the northern site, bereft of these.
As he ceases gazing, an old man stands alone by his side, worthy of reverence, with a long, hoary beard. The light of the four stars shines on his face, making him appear like the sun.
The old man asks, ""Say who are ye, that stemming the blind stream, Forth from th' eternal prison-house have fled?"" He asks who conducted them or lit their way from the darkness of Hell. He questions if the statutes of the abyss are broken or if new laws are ordained in heaven.
Virgil, taking hold of the narrator, makes him kneel in reverence. Virgil replies he comes not of himself but was besought by a ""Dame from heaven"" (Beatrice). He explains that the narrator, a mortal, never saw the farthest gloom but erred through folly, approaching so near that little space was left to turn. Virgil was dispatched to rescue him, and this (Purgatory) was the only way. He has shown the narrator all regions of the bad and now purposes to show spirits purged of sin under the old man's command. He explains that ""From high descends the virtue"" aiding their journey. He asks for acceptance, stating the narrator journeys in search of ""liberty,"" dear to those who refused life for it, like the old man himself, who found death sweet in Utica.
Virgil adds that ""the' eternal edicts are unmov'd: He breathes, and I am free of Minos' power,"" abiding in the circle where the eyes of ""thy chaste Marcia beam."" He implores the old man by Marcia's love to let them pass through his ""sev'n regions,"" promising thanks from Marcia if he does not disdain mention below.
The old man (Cato) replies that Marcia was pleasing in his sight while he was there, and he granted all her requests. But now that she dwells beyond the ""accursed stream,"" she cannot move him due to the law ordained when he issued thence. However, if a ""Dame from heaven"" directs Virgil, no flattery is needed; her name is enough. He instructs them, ""Go therefore now: and with a slender reed See that thou duly gird him, and his face Lave, till all sordid stain thou wipe from thence."" He explains that it would not be seemly for the protagonist to come before ""the foremost minister in heaven"" with eyes obscured. He states that this islet, where the wave beats, produces many reeds on its oozy bed, but no other plant that doesn't bend to the water's sway. He tells them not to return this way but that the rising sun will show them the easiest ascent of the mountain.
Cato disappears. The narrator rises, speechless, and turns to Virgil, who tells him to follow, as they must retreat to where the plain declines.
Dawn has chased the morning prime. The narrator sees the trembling of the ocean stream. They traverse the deserted plain like lost travelers. Where the dew still strives with the sun and a fresh wind breathes, Virgil places both hands on the watery grass. The narrator, understanding his intent, stretches his tear-suffused cheeks to him. Virgil restores his hue concealed by the shades of hell.
On the solitary shore, Virgil girds the narrator with a reed as instructed. The narrator marvels that wherever one reed is plucked, another immediately arises.

**CANTO II**
The sun has reached the horizon that covers Salem's walls, and night, opposite to the sun, has issued from the Ganges, holding the scales dropped when she reigns highest. Aurora's cheek has turned to orange where the narrator is.
They linger by the water's brink. A light appears swiftly coming through the sea, no winged course equaling its career. The narrator asks Virgil about it, then sees it grow in size and brightness. Something of bright hue appears on either side, then another from underneath. Virgil remains silent until he recognizes the pilot, then cries, ""Down, down; bend low Thy knees; behold God's angel: fold thy hands: Now shalt thou see true Ministers indeed.""
Virgil notes how the angel needs no oar or other sail but his wings. The ""bird of God"" appears brighter as it approaches, so bright the narrator must bend down his eyes. It drives ashore a small, swift, light bark that drinks no wave. The heavenly steersman is seen at the prow, ""visibly written blessed in his looks.""
Within are a hundred spirits or more, singing ""In Exitu Israel de Aegypto"" together. The angel blesses them with the sign of the holy cross, and they leap out on land. The angel returns swiftly. The crew is astounded, gazing around.
The sun darts its beams, having chased Capricorn. The strange tribe, lifting their eyes to them, asks, ""If ye know, Declare what path will Lead us to the mount.""
Virgil replies they are strangers here, having come by a ""rough and hard"" road, so the ascent will seem like play. The spirits, perceiving the narrator lives from his breathing, grow pale with wonder. Like a crowd flocking a herald, they fix on him, forgetting their errand.
One spirit darts forward with fond ardor to embrace the narrator. The narrator tries to clasp him, but his hands pass through empty. The shadow smiles and draws back. The narrator hastens to follow, but it bids him desist. He recognizes it as Casella and asks him to pause and talk. Casella replies he loves him still as in his mortal frame and pauses, asking why the narrator walks there.
The narrator replies he journeys to return to the world. He asks why Casella lost so much time. Casella explains that the angel, who ""takes when and whom he chooses,"" often denied him passage. But for the past three months, he has taken whoever wished to enter with free leave. Casella gained kind admittance at the Tiber's mouth, where his wings are pointed, for all who do not descend to Acheron throng there.
The narrator asks Casella, if new laws have not destroyed memory of his ""sweet song of love,"" to console his spirit, overcome by pain from traveling far with its frame. Casella sings ""Love that discourses in my thoughts"" with such soft accents that the sweetness still thrills the narrator. Virgil and all the other spirits are so pleased that nothing else seems to occupy their thoughts.
They stand in mute attention. The venerable old man (Cato) exclaims, ""How is this, ye tardy spirits? What negligence detains you loit'ring here? Run to the mountain to cast off those scales, that from your eyes the sight of God conceal."" Like a flock of pigeons abandoning their meal when alarmed, the new-come troop deserts the song and hastens to the mountain's side, as one who goes yet knows not where he tends. The narrator and Virgil also depart with hurried steps.

**CANTO III**
The sudden flight scatters the spirits toward the mountain. The narrator adheres to Virgil, wondering how he could have sped without him. Virgil seems smitten with the ""bitter pang of self-remorse.""
As Virgil slows his pace, the narrator's mind expands with joy. He sets his face against the steep ascent. The sun, flaring behind, is broken by his form, as his rays meet resistance in him. He turns aside, fearing he's been left, seeing only the ground obscured before him. Virgil kindly asks, ""Why distrustest thou? Believ'st not I am with thee, thy sure guide?"" He explains it is evening where his body lies, removed to Naples. He tells the narrator not to marvel if no shadow falls before him, no more than one ray obstructs another in the sky. He states that bodies endure torments of heat and cold by a virtue whose working God wills not to be revealed. He calls insane anyone who hopes reason can explore the space holding ""three persons in one substance."" He advises against seeking the ""wherefore,"" reminding them that many desired fruitlessly, like Plato and the Stagyrite. Virgil then bows his forehead and breaks off speech in troubled mood.
They reach the mountain's foot, finding the rock so steep that climbing it would be vain. Even the wildest, most untrodden path elsewhere would be an easy ladder compared to this.
Virgil asks, ""Who knows on which hand now the steep declines?... so that he may ascend, who journeys without aid of wine?"" As he explores the pathway, the narrator gazes upward and sees spirits approaching so slowly they seem not to move.
The narrator points them out to Virgil, who replies, ""Let us tend thither: they but softly come. And thou be firm in hope, my son belov'd.""
The spirits are a thousand paces behind them when they draw back on the crags and stand unmoved, like one walking in doubt. Virgil addresses them as ""O spirits perfect! O already chosen!"" asking them by ""blest peace"" to instruct them where the mountain declines, so their attempt to mount is not vain. He notes that loss of time grieves most him who knows most.
Like sheep stepping from their fold, first one, then pairs or threes, while the rest stand fearfully, bending eye and nose to ground, following the foremost, so the first of the fortunate crew move forward, modest and graceful. When they see the light from the narrator's right side fall broken on the ground, casting a shadow, they stop and retreat.
Virgil confesses it is a human body they see and asks them not to marvel at the broken light, but to believe they aspire to climb ""not without virtue deriv'd from Heaven."" The virtuous tribe replies, ""Turn, and before you there the entrance lies,"" signaling with bent hands.
One spirit asks the narrator to turn his visage and see if he has ever seen him. The narrator turns and beholds a comely, fair, and gentle spirit with a gash on one brow. The narrator humbly disclaims ever having seen him. The spirit then shows a wound high on his breast and smilingly says, ""I am Manfredi, grandson to the Queen Costanza."" He asks the narrator, when returned to his fair daughter (parent of Aragon and Sicily's pride), to inform her of the truth if anything else is told of him. He explains that after two mortal blows shattered his frame, he turned weeping to God, who forgives. His sins were horrible, but infinite goodness receives all who turn to it. Had Cosenza's shepherd (who Clement sent to hunt him) better scanned this divine text, his bones would have lain near Benevento, protected by a mole. But now rain drenches them and wind drives them to the Verde stream, where, with lights extinguished, they were removed from their bed.
Manfredi states that ""by their curse we are not so destroy'd, but that the eternal love may turn, while hope retains her verdant blossoms."" He explains that one who dies in contumacy against the holy church, though repentant, must wander ""thirty-fold for all the time in his presumption past,"" if not shortened by ""prayers of good men."" He asks the narrator to advance his bliss by revealing to Costanza how he beheld him and the terms of his interdict, for ""much profit comes by means of those below.""

**CANTO IV**
The narrator reflects that when a sensation seizes a faculty, the soul collects itself on that power alone, disproving the error that the soul is not singly lighted in the breast. So when something heard or seen keeps the soul turned, time passes unnoticed. This truth he finds by proof, hearing the spirit and wondering, for the sun had measured fifty steps unobserved. Then, all the spirits shout, ""Here is what ye ask.""
The path they ascend is a narrow ""aperture,"" like a forked thorn stake stopping a larger opening to a vineyard. The narrator and Virgil ascend solitary. He notes that one needs to fly ""with the swift wing and plumes of high desire"" here.
They ascend through broken rock, close-pent on each side, needing hands and feet. Reaching near the highest ridge, where the plain opens, the narrator exclaims, ""O master! say which way can we proceed?"" Virgil replies, ""Let no step of thine recede. Behind me gain the mountain, till to us some practis'd guide appear."" The eminence is so lofty no eye can reach its point, and the side rises more steeply than a line from the mid-quadrant to the center.
Wearied, the narrator asks Virgil to turn and behold him. Virgil replies, ""My son! Thus far put forth thy strength;"" and points to a track projecting around the hill. Spurred by his words, the narrator clambers behind him until his feet press the plain circuit beneath.
Seated there together, they turn eastward, whence their ascent began. The narrator looks at the nether shores, then to the sun, wondering that it smote them from the left. Virgil perceives his amazement and explains that if Leda's offspring (Castor and Pollux, associated with Gemini) were with the sun, the ruddy zodiac would wheel nearer the bears, if it hadn't forsaken its ancient course. He explains that if Sion and this mountain were placed on earth with one horizon, the path of the sun, which Phaeton misguided, would pass by one on one side and by the other on the other side.
The narrator exclaims that he never saw anything so clear, discerning where his ken seemed to fail. He understands that the ""mid orb of the supernal motion"" (the Equator) departs toward the north from here, while those in Judea see it toward the warmer part. He then asks how far they have to journey, as the hill mounts higher than his sight.
Virgil replies that the ascent is difficult at first but grows easier the more one proceeds. When it seems pleasant, then it will be easy, like going down the tide in a vessel. Then he will reach the end of this path and can hope to rest. ""No more I answer, and thus far for certain know.""
As Virgil finishes, a voice sounds nearby, ""Yet ye first perchance may to repose you by constraint be led."" They turn and see a huge stone, of which neither was aware. They draw to it and find some spirits standing behind the rock, ""as a man thru' idleness might stand."" One, seeming very weary, sits down, folding his knees about with his face bent down between them.
The narrator points him out to Virgil as more idle than if laziness were his sister. The spirit turns to them, lifts his face over his thigh, and says, ""Up then, proceed Thou valiant one."" The narrator recognizes him. Despite his breathlessness, he approaches. The spirit, Belacqua, barely lifts his head, saying, ""Well hast thou discern'd, How from the left the sun his chariot leads.""
The narrator laughs at Belacqua's lazy acts and broken words, saying he grieves for him no more. He asks why Belacqua sits upright, waiting for an escort, or if it is just his accustomed ways. Belacqua replies, ""My brother, of what use to mount, when to my suffering would not let me pass the bird of God, who at the portal sits?"" He says he must be borne around outside Heaven's limits for as long as he delayed repentant sighs in life, ""if prayer do not aid me first, that riseth up from heart which lives in grace.""
Virgil, ascending, cries, ""Haste thee, for see the sun has touch'd the point meridian, and the night now covers with her foot Marocco's shore.""

**CANTO V**
The narrator leaves those spirits and follows Virgil. One spirit points at him, exclaiming, ""See how it seems as if the light not shone from the left hand of him beneath, and he, as living, seems to be led on."" The narrator turns and sees them gazing at him, then at the broken light beneath.
Virgil exclaims, ""Why are thy thoughts thus riveted... that thou hast slack'd thy pace? or how imports it thee, what thing is whisper'd here? Come after me, and to their babblings leave the crowd. Be as a tower, that, firmly set, shakes not its top for any blast that blows! He, in whose bosom thought on thought shoots out, still of his aim is wide."" The narrator replies, ""I come,"" with a tinge of color that merits pardon.
A little way before them, some come along the hill, singing ""Miserere."" Perceiving the narrator's body gives way for rays to pass, they change their song to a ""long and hoarse exclaim."" Two run as messengers to meet them, asking to learn of their condition. Virgil tells them to return and bear tidings that his frame ""is real flesh."" If they paused to view his shade, ""enough is answer'd them."" He tells them to honor and prize the narrator.
The spirits return swiftly, like fiery vapors or August clouds. Arriving, they wheel back on them like a troop with loose rein. Virgil exclaims that many throng to petition the narrator, telling him to go on and listen.
The spirits shout, ""O spirit! who go'st on to blessedness with the same limbs, that clad thee at thy birth, a little rest thy step. Look if any one amongst our tribe thou hast e'er beheld, that tidings of him there thou mayst report. Ah, wherefore go'st thou on? Ah wherefore tarriest thou not? We all by violence died, and to our latest hour were sinners, but then warn'd by light from heav'n, so that, repenting and forgiving, we did issue out of life at peace with God, who with desire to see him fills our heart.""
The narrator replies he sees their visages but remembers none. He offers to perform any service they wish, by the peace he seeks.
One spirit replies that none distrust his kindness, even without an oath, so long as his will doesn't fail for want of power. He, speaking first, entreats the narrator, if he ever sees the land between Romagna and Charles' realm, to courteously ask those in Fano to pray for him to purge his grievous sins. He came from there. He explains that the deep passages where his blood issued were made on his bosom in Antenor's land, where he thought to be secure. The author of the deed was Este's prince, who pursued him with excessive wrath. He states he might have breathed had he fled toward Mira when overtaken at Oriaco, but he sped to the marsh, fell tangled, and saw his life-blood float the plain.
Another spirit says, ""Ah! so may the wish, that takes thee o'er the mountain, be fulfill'd, As thou shalt graciously give aid to mine. Of Montefeltro I; Buonconte I: Giovanna nor none else have care for me, Sorrowing with these I therefore go."" The narrator asks what force or chance drew him from Campaldino's field that his sepulture was never known.
Buonconte replies that a stream named Archiano runs at Casentino's foot, sprung in Apennine. Where its name is canceled, he came, pierced in the heart, fleeing on foot, bloodying the plain. Sight and speech failed him, and he fell, finishing with Mary's name, his flesh tenantless. He tells the narrator to report the truth to the living. God's angel took him, while the devil of hell exclaimed, ""O thou from heav'n! Say wherefore hast thou robb'd me? Thou of him Th' eternal portion bear'st with thee away For one poor tear that he deprives me of. But of the other, other rule I make.""
Buonconte explains how the devil then came, using his power to raise wind and smoky mist from collected vapor, covering the valley from Pratomagno to the mountain range with clouds as day spent. The impregnated air changed to water, and rain fell, rushing into the fosses and then to the great river with headlong sweep. The stiffened frame of Buonconte was found at the Archiano's mouth and dashed into the Arno, loosening the cross he made on himself. The river hurled him on, wrapping him in muddy spoils.
The third spirit, Pia, asks the narrator to remember her when he returns to the world. She says, ""I once was Pia. Sienna gave me life, Maremma took it from me. That he knows, Who me with jewell'd ring had first espous'd.""

**CANTO VI**
Men separating from a game of dice, the loser remains sad, while others go with the winner. One runs ahead, one twitches his mantle, one bids him remember him. The winner stops not, but motions them aside. The narrator was like this, escaping the throng by promising.
He saw him from Arezzo who fell by Ghino's arm, and him swallowed by the stream in his chase. Frederic Novello entreated with outstretched hand, and the one from Pisa who tested Marzuco's constancy. He beheld Count Orso and the soul of Peter de la Brosse, dismissed from life for spite and envy, not crime. He warns the Lady of Brabant to beware lest she herd with worse for her false deed.
Freed from spirits praying for others' prayers, the narrator asks Virgil why his text states heaven's supreme decree cannot bend to supplication, yet these entreat with this design. Virgil replies that both his writing and their hope are valid, if the narrator considers that ""the sacred height of judgment doth not stoop, because love's flame in a short moment all fulfils, which he who sojourns here, in right should satisfy."" He adds that when he wrote, prayers had no access to God (for those in Limbo). He advises the narrator not to rest content unless Beatrice, who infuses light between truth and mind, assures him. He states Beatrice is above, on the mountain's crown.
The narrator asks Virgil to mend their speed, as he is not tired and the hill stretches its shadow far. Virgil replies their progress will be as much as they can dispatch for the day. He explains that the narrator cannot be there until he once more beholds the sun returning, which is now hidden behind the steep. He then points out a solitary spirit looking at them, saying it will instruct them.
They approach the spirit, who stands in ""high abstracted mood,"" scarce moving his eyes. It speaks nothing, but lets them pass, eyeing them like a lion. Virgil politely asks for the best ascent. The spirit returns no answer but asks of their country and life. When Virgil says ""Mantua,"" the solitary shadow rises and cries, ""Mantuan! I am thy countryman Sordello."" They embrace.
The narrator laments ""slavish Italy! thou inn of grief,"" a vessel without a pilot, no longer lady of provinces but a ""brothel-house."" This gentle spirit from the sound of his land greeted a fellow citizen with glad cheer, while Italy's living ones war among themselves, even within the same walls. He urges Italy to look around her coasts and see if any part enjoys peace. He questions the use of Justinian's reins if the saddle is unpressed, saying it aggravates her shame. He calls for the people to obey and let Caesar sit in the saddle, if they marked God's commands. He blames ""German Albert"" for abandoning Italy, who has grown savage for lack of spur. He calls for ""Just judgment from the stars"" to fall on Albert's blood, striking his successor with dread, for he and his father have allowed the ""garden of the empire to run waste"" through greed.
He bids them come see the Capulets and Montagues, Philippeschi and Monaldi, sunk in grief and racked by suspicion. He urges a cruel one (Albert) to come and behold the oppression of nobles and their injuries, and what safety Santafiore can supply. He calls on Albert to see Rome, a desolate widow, crying for her Caesar. He asks if God's eyes are turned elsewhere, or if this is part of His counsel.
He notes that Italian cities are ""o'erthrong'd with tyrants,"" with every villager a ""great Marcellus."" He then addresses Florence, saying she may remain unmoved by this digression, thanks to her wise people. Many have justice in their heart, long waiting for counsel, but Florence has it ""on their lip's edge."" Many refuse to bear common burdens, but Florence answers uncalled, crying, ""Behold I stoop!"" He bids Florence be glad for her wealth, peace, and wisdom, but states facts will witness his truth. Athens and Sparta made little progress compared to Florence, who uses such subtlety that she weaves a thread in October that scarce reaches mid-November. How many times have customs, laws, coins, and offices been renewed, and people changed? He says Florence is like a sick wretch who finds no rest, shifting sides for respite.

**CANTO VII**
After seven joyful greetings, Sordello asks, ""Who are ye?"" Virgil replies that his bones were buried by Octavius before this mount was sought by spirits. He is Virgil, deprived of heaven only for ""lack of faith."" Sordello appears to waver, then bows and embraces Virgil, calling him ""Glory of Latium!"" He asks what desert or undeserved favor shows Virgil to him, and if he comes from below and what cloister.
Virgil replies he has arrived through every orb of that sad region, led by heavenly influence. He states there is a place below, not of torments but dun shades, where mourning breathes in sighs. He abides there with ""little innocents"" (unbaptized infants) and those who did not put on the three holy virtues but understood and followed the rest.
He asks Sordello to direct them to where Purgatory truly begins. Sordello replies they have no certain place; he can go up or around. He will guide them as far as he can. But as day declines, they cannot proceed upwards by night. Therefore, they should choose a ""place of pleasant sojourn."" Some spirits sit apart to the right. He will lead them there.
Virgil asks why ascending by night is impossible, if by another or through weakness. Sordello, trailing his finger on the ground, replies, ""Only this line thou shalt not overpass, soon as the sun hath disappear'd; not that aught else impedes thy going upwards, save the shades of night."" These perplex the will. They might return below or wander around the mountain.
Virgil, marveling, exclaims, ""Then lead us quickly, where thou sayst, that, while we stay, we may enjoy delight."" They move a little space, and the narrator perceives the mountain hollowed out like large valleys. Sordello points to where ""the high bank recedes"" in a bosom, telling them to await the renewal of day.
A crooked path leads them traverse into the ridge's side. Refulgent gold, silver, scarlet grain, ceruse, Indian wood, and fresh emeralds are surpassed by the colors of the herbs and flowers in that recess. Nature not only lavishes colors but also creates a ""rare and undistinguish'd fragrance.""
The narrator sees spirits sitting on the grass and flowers, chanting ""Salve Regina."" Virgil, who turned their steps, says before the sun sets, they should not proceed. From this eminence, they will better discern the acts and visages of all.
He points to Rodolph, sitting high above the rest, appearing to have neglected his duty, not moving his lip to the others' song. Rodolph, the Emperor, ""might have heal'd the wounds whereof fair Italy hath died."" Next, Ottocar, who comforted Rodolph, swayed the country where the Moldaw springs. He was worth more in swaddling clothes than his son Winceslaus, ""a bearded man, pamper'd with rank luxuriousness and ease."" The next, with a depressed nose, in counsel with the gentle-looking one, ""flying expir'd, with'ring the lily's flower"" (Philip III of France). He knocks his breast. The other, making a couch for his cheek with his hand, sighs frequently. They are the father (Philip III) and father-in-law (Charles I of Anjou) of ""Gallia's bane"" (Philip IV). They know his vicious life, hence their grief.
He points to one ""so robust of limb,"" keeping measure in song, who ""with ev'ry virtue bore his girdle brac'd"" (Peter III of Aragon). If his son (Alfonso III) had lived, his virtue would have been poured from vessel to like vessel, which cannot be said of his other heirs, James and Frederick. Human worth rarely mounts to the branches of the tree, ordained by God as a free gift. Virgil applies these words to Charles (Charles II of Anjou) no less than his brother, which Pouille and Provence now grieve, as the plant degenerates from its seed. Costanza still boasts of her valorous spouse more than Beatrice and Margaret.
He then points to ""the king of simple life and plain, Harry of England, sitting there alone,"" who spreads better issue through his branches. Lastly, he points to ""That one, who on the ground beneath the rest sits lowest, yet his gaze directs aloft,"" who is William, the brave Marquis, whose actions at Alexandria and his war make Confrat and Canavese weep.

**CANTO VIII**
It is the hour that awakens fond desire in men at sea and melts pilgrims' hearts. The narrator, no longer heeding to hear, begins to mark one spirit risen from its seat, imploring audience with its hand. It joins its palms and raises them, gazing steadfastly toward the east, as if telling God, ""I care for naught beside."" It sings ""Te Lucis Ante"" so devoutly and softly that the narrator's senses are lost. The rest follow with the hymn, gazing upward.
The narrator tells the reader to make their eyes keen for the truth. He sees the gentle band look up silently, pale and lowly. He sees two angels descend from on high, with flame-illuminated swords, broken at their points. Their vesture and wings are green. One stands over them, the other on the opposing hill, containing the troop in the middle. The narrator sees the whiteness on their heads but cannot discern their visages, overpowered by too much brightness. Sordello exclaims, ""From Mary's bosom both are come... as a guard over the vale, ganst him, who hither tends, The serpent."" The narrator turns around, frozen with fear, clinging to Virgil.
Sordello says, ""To the valley now (For it is time) let us descend; and hold converse with those great shadows: haply much Their sight may please ye."" The narrator measures three steps and is beneath, noting one spirit who looks desirous to know him. The air is dim but clears enough to reveal what was concealed.
They advance toward each other. The narrator feels joy recognizing Nino, a ""courteous judge."" They exchange kind salutations. Nino asks how long since the narrator arrived at the mountain's foot. The narrator replies he came through the sad seats of woe this morning, still in his first life, journeying to gain the other. Nino and Sordello draw back, amazed. One turns to Virgil, the other to a seated spirit, crying, ""Conrad! up with speed: Come, see what of his grace high God hath will'd.""
Nino then turns to the narrator, saying, ""By that rare mark of honour which thou ow'st to him, who hides so deeply his first cause... when thou shalt be beyond the vast of waves. Tell my Giovanna, that for me she call there, where reply to innocence is made."" He believes his mother no longer loves him, having changed her white and wimpled folds, which she will wish for again with grief. He says her actions easily show ""how long in women lasts the flame of love, if sight and touch do not relume it oft."" He adds that the viper (Visconti) calling Milan to the field will not make her a burial as fair as ""shrill Gallura's bird"" (Nino's own coat of arms, the cock).
Nino speaks with the stamp of ""right seal"" glowing in his bosom. Meanwhile, the narrator's eyes travel to heaven, where the bright stars are slowest. Virgil asks what has caught his gaze. The narrator replies, ""The three torches, with which here the pole is all on fire."" Virgil explains that the four stars seen this morning are beneath, and these have risen in their stead.
While Virgil speaks, Sordello draws him and cries, ""Lo there our enemy!"" pointing to a serpent along the side where no barrier rises around the little vale, ""such haply as gave Eve the bitter food."" The evil snake comes on between the grass and flowers, reverting its head, licking its back. The narrator cannot tell how the celestial falcons moved from their seat, but he sees them in motion, hearing the air cut by their green plumes. The serpent flees, and the angels return to their stations.
The spirit (who had come to Nino) has not loosened his sight from the narrator through all the conflict. He begins, ""So may the lamp, which leads thee up on high, find, in thy destin'd lot, of wax so much, As may suffice thee to the enamel's height."" He then says, ""If any certain news of Valdimagra and the neighbour part Thou know'st, tell me, who once was mighty there They call'd me Conrad Malaspina, not That old one, but from him I sprang. The love I bore my people is now here refin'd.""
The narrator replies he was never in their dominions, but their glory is manifest throughout Europe. He praises their illustrious house, saying its fame proclaims its nobles and land, so even those who were never there know it. He swears that their nation does not impair ""the value of her coffer and her sword."" Nature and custom give her such privilege that while the world is twisted by a bad head, she alone ""walks aright, and has the evil way in scorn."" Conrad Malaspina then says, ""Now pass thee on: sev'n times the tired sun Revisits not the couch, which with four feet The forked Aries covers, ere that kind opinion shall be nail'd into thy brain with stronger nails than other's speech can drive, if the sure course of judgment be not stay'd."" He bids them farewell, as dawn glimmers and the angel comes. He would not hear more.

**CANTO IX**
Tithonus' old consort (Aurora) looks palely over the eastern cliff, her brow lucid with jewels. Night has passed two steps of her ascent, and the third is closing. The narrator, having ""so much of Adam"" (mortality) with him, sinks down upon the grass, overcome with sleep, where all five (Virgil, Sordello, Nino, Conrad, and the narrator) are seated.
Near dawn, when the swallow renews her sad lay and minds wander more from the flesh, full of holy divination in dreams, the narrator dreams of a golden-feathered eagle in the sky, hovering for descent. He imagines he is in the place from where Ganymede was snatched. He thinks the eagle strikes its quarry only here. The eagle wheels, rushes down, and snatches him upward ""even to the fire."" He thinks both he and the eagle burn intensely, breaking his sleep.
He shakes himself, like Achilles awaking on Scyros, pale like one ice-struck with dread. Virgil stands by his side. The sun is now more than two hours aloft. The narrator looks to the sea. Virgil cries, ""Fear not: assur'd we are at happy point. Thy strength shrink not, but rise dilated. Thou art come To Purgatory now."" He points to the cliff and the entrance where it seems disparted. Virgil explains that before dawn, a lady (Lucia) came while the narrator slept in the flowery vale. She told him, ""I am Lucia. Suffer me to take this man, who slumbers. Easier so his way shall speed."" Sordello and the other spirits tarried, and she bore the narrator up to this summit as day shone, and Virgil pursued her steps. She placed him there, and her eyes showed Virgil the entrance, then she vanished with his sleep.
The narrator is changed from doubt to comfort. Virgil, seeing him fearless, moves up the cliff, and the narrator follows. The narrator notes that his theme rises, so he props the structure more artfully. They draw near an opening like a breach in a wall, seeing a portal and three steps leading to it, each of a different color. One watches but speaks no word.
The watcher is seated on the highest step, his visage beyond the narrator's power to bear. He grasps a naked sword, whose rays glance back, dazzling the narrator. He cries, ""Speak from whence ye stand: What would ye? Where is your escort? Take heed your coming upward harm ye not."" Virgil replies a ""heavenly dame"" told them to ""Pass that way: here the gate is."" The courteous keeper replies, ""And may she befriending prosper your ascent... Come then Before our steps."" They go there.
The lowest stair is ""marble white so smooth and polish'd,"" reflecting the narrator's form. The next is ""darker than sablest grain,"" a rough, singed block, cracked lengthwise and across. The third, massy above, seems porphyry, ""flam'd red as the life-blood spouting from a vein."" On this, God's angel (the keeper) sustains either foot, seated on a diamond threshold.
Virgil cheerily draws the narrator up the steps, telling him to ask with a humble heart to unbar the bolt. The narrator casts himself at the angel's feet, praying for pity and opening. He falls thrice on his bosom. The angel inscribes seven P's (for peccata, sins) on his forehead with the blunt point of his drawn sword, saying, ""Look... When enter'd, that thou wash these scars away."" The angel's robe is the color of ashes or dry earth. From beneath his vestment, he draws two keys: one gold, one silver. With the pale key first, then the burnished, he plies the gate. He states that if either key fails to turn in the keyhole, access is in vain. The gold key is more precious, but the silver needs skill and sagacity. He holds them from Peter, instructed to err rather in opening than keeping fast, so long as the suppliant implores.
He thrusts open the door, exclaiming, ""Enter, but this warning hear: He forth again departs who looks behind."" The swivels turn with a strong, harsh grating sound. The narrator listens, hearing ""We praise thee, O God,"" blended with sweet melody, like choral voices with organ music.

**CANTO X**
Having passed the threshold (which the soul's ill affection disuses, making the crooked seem straighter), the narrator hears it close. He wonders what plea would have availed had he turned his eyes back.
They mount the ""riven rock,"" winding alternately like waves. Virgil says, ""Here some little art behooves us... that our steps observe the varying flexure of the path."" They speed so slowly that the moon once more rises before they thread the strait.
When they come to an open area where the mountain retires as one solid mass, the narrator is spent with toil, and both are uncertain of the way. The plain is more lonesome than desert roads. From the brink to the foot of the steep bank, the space measures thrice a man's stature. The cornice appears equal in extent as far as his eye can see.
Before their feet move on the summit, the narrator discovers the bank is ""marble white,"" sculptured so exquisitely that Polycletus and nature itself would be shamed. The angel who brought tidings of peace, sculpted to life, seems to say ""Hail!"" for Mary (who opened the heavenly gates) is imaged there, with the words ""Behold the handmaid of the Lord.""
Virgil tells the narrator not to fix his mind on one place. The narrator turns and marks another story graven on the rock, behind Mary's form. He moves near it. Engraved in the same marble are the cart and kine drawing the sacred ark, aweing mankind from its unbidden office. Many people come before it, parted in seven choirs. One hears them not singing, another hears them sing. A doubt arises between eye and smell from the curled incense fume. Preceding the ark is David, Israel's harper, dancing and leaping, seeming ""Less and yet more than kingly."" Opposite, from a great palace, Michol looks forth ""like a lady full of scorn and sorrow.""
The narrator then moves to behold the next tablet, which shines whitely. Stored on the rock is the glory of Emperor Trajan, whose worth moved Gregory to earn his conquest. A widow stands at his bridle, attired in tears and mourning, amidst a throng of knights with eagles overhead. The wretch appears to say, ""Grant vengeance, sire! for, woe beshrew this heart my son is murder'd."" Trajan replies, ""Wait now till I return."" She asks what if he does not return. He says, ""Where I am, who then is, may right thee."" She asks what is others' good if he neglects his own. At length he answers, ""It beseemeth well My duty be perform'd, ere I move hence: So justice wills; and pity bids me stay.""
The narrator marvels at this visible speaking, new and strange. He gazes fondly on these patterns of ""meek humbleness."" Virgil whispers, ""Lo... a multitude advance. These to the lofty steps shall guide us on."" The narrator turns his eyes.
The narrator warns the reader not to miss their purpose, hearing how God decrees debts be canceled. He tells them not to ponder the form of suffering but what succeeds. Virgil tells him that what he sees tending hither ""bears no trace of human semblance."" Virgil explains they are ""courb'd to earth, beneath their heavy teems of torment,"" so even his eye struggled at first. He bids him look intently to discern their pangs.
The narrator then exclaims, ""Christians and proud! O poor and wretched ones! That feeble in the mind's eye, lean your trust upon unstaid perverseness! Know ye not that we are worms, yet made at last to form the winged insect, imp'd with angel plumes that to heaven's justice unobstructed soars? Why buoy ye up aloft your unfleg'd souls? Abortive then and shapeless ye remain, Like the untimely embryon of a worm!""
He sees these spirits fashioned like a corbel supporting a floor, crumpling knees to breast, stirring ""ruth unfeign'd."" Each is more or less contract according to his burden, but one, showing most patience, wails, ""I can endure no more.""

**CANTO XI**
The spirits under their heavy burdens pray the ""Our Father,"" imploring God to hallow His name, join creation to extol His might, and bring His kingdom's peace. They ask that His will be done on earth as by angels in heaven. They pray for daily manna and for pardon as they pardon others. They ask God not to let their virtue be easily subdued by the old adversary, but to free them from his incitements. This last petition is for those remaining on earth, not for themselves.
The narrator reflects that these spirits go round the first circuit, purging ""the world's gross darkness off."" He wonders what can be vowed for them by those on earth whose wills have ""root of goodness."" He concludes they should help them wash away stains so they may spring to the starry spheres.
He then asks them that as mercy-tempered justice speeds their burdens, they would show him the shortest way to the ladder and the easiest ascent, as he, bearing Adam's fleshly raiment, mounts slowly despite his will.
The answer does not reveal the speaker but instructs them, ""Along the bank to rightward come with us, and ye shall find a pass that mocks not toil of living man to climb."" The speaker adds that were he not hindered by the rock taming his ""arrogant neck,"" forcing him to stoop his visage to the ground, he would view the living man to see if he knew him and crave his pity. He identifies himself as Omberto, ""of Latiun, of a Tuscan horn A mighty one."" His ""old blood and forefathers' gallant deeds"" made him so haughty that he forgot ""the common mother"" and scorned men, hence his fall, by a fate Sienna's sons in Campagnatico can tell. Pride injured not only him but his kindred. His lot is to groan under this weight until he appeases God's justice.
The narrator bends his visage, and another spirit (not the speaker) twisted beneath the weight sees him, recognizes him, and calls. He fixes his eyes with difficulty as the narrator passes. The narrator exclaims, ""Oderigi, art not thou Agobbio's glory, glory of that art which they of Paris call the limmer's skill?""
Oderigi replies, ""Brother! with tints that gayer smile, Bolognian Franco's pencil lines the leaves. His all the honour now; mine borrow'd light."" He admits he was not courteous in life due to zeal for pre-eminence, for which he pays here. He would not be here had he not turned to God before he was unable to sin. He laments the vanity of human glory, how Cimabue's fame was eclipsed by Giotto, and how one Guido snatched the prize from another, and another may yet drive both from their nest. Worldly fame is but a blast of wind. He asks if the narrator will live longer in men's mouths if his flesh is shriveled than if he died earlier, noting that such a span is briefer than a twinkling of an eye compared to eternity. He points to the spirit before him, Provenzano, who once resounded widely through Tuscany but is now scarce named in Sienna. He was sovereign when Florence fell to ""madd'ning rage,"" proud then as she is loathsome now. He says renown is like an herb that withers.
The narrator tells Oderigi his words breathe meekness and allay his ""tumours."" He asks about Provenzano. Oderigi replies Provenzano is here because he ""reach'd, with grasp presumptuous, at the sway of all Sienna."" He still goes, never resting since he died, an acquittance for his excessive earthly daring.
The narrator then asks how Provenzano gained admittance so soon, given that souls delaying repentance linger in lower spaces unless prayers befriend them. Oderigi explains that when Provenzano was at his glory's height, casting aside dignity, he ""fix'd him on Sienna's plain, a suitor to redeem his suff'ring friend, who languish'd in the prison-house of Charles,"" not refusing to tremble for his sake. He will say no more, knowing his words are dark, but the narrator's neighbors will soon comment on the text. He says ""This is the work, that from these limits freed him.""

**CANTO XII**
The narrator journeys with the laden spirit (Omberto) at equal pace, like oxen, as long as Virgil permits. When Virgil bids him quit and proceed, stating each man must push his bark with sail and oars, the narrator raises his body, ready for speed, but remains submissive in thought.
He pursues Virgil, who warns him to ""Bend thine eyesight down: For thou to ease the way shall find it good To ruminate the bed beneath thy feet.""
The narrator sees sculptured forms on the earth-level tombs, like memorials. Here, with more curious skill, whatever space stretches from the mountain is portrayed. He sees Lucifer, once noblest, falling lightning from heaven. On the other side, Briareus is pierced by a celestial bolt, cumbering earth. He sees the Thymbraean god (Apollo) with Mars and Pallas around their father (Jove), armed, gazing on the giant's limbs. He sees Nimrod at the foot of the stupendous work (Babel), bewildered, looking at the crowd attempting to build in Sennaar's plain.
He then beholds Niobe in a trance of woe, seven sons slain on either side. He sees Saul, ghastly, expiring on his own sword in Gilboa, never since visited by rain or dew. He sees Arachne, half spider, crawling up her unfinished web. He sees Rehoboam, fear-smote, whirled in his chariot with none to chase him.
It is shown how Alcmaeon forced his mother to rate her ill-received ornament. How Sennacherib's sons fell on him in the temple. Tomyris's scath and cruel mangling of Cyrus, crying, ""Blood thou didst thirst for, take thy fill of blood!"" The Assyrians routed, Holofernes slain. Troy in ashes and caverns. He remarks on the masterly skill of the portrayals, where the dead seemed dead and the living seemed alive. He urges the proud ""sons of Eve"" to swell not their necks, lest their looks betray their evil path.
So engrossed in thought, the narrator does not notice how much of the mount they have circled or how much more of the sun's course has passed. Virgil warns him to raise his head, for it is not time for slow suspense. He points to an angel approaching, the ""sixth handmaid"" returning from service. He tells the narrator to wear a seemly grace of awe so the angel will gladly further them aloft, reminding him that ""this day ne'er dawns again.""
The narrator, repeatedly warned about time's loss, understands. The angel approaches, snow-white in vesture, with a visage casting tremulous lustre. He opens his arms and wings, saying, ""Onward: the steps, behold! are near; and now th' ascent is without difficulty gain'd.""
The narrator laments that few hasten at such tidings. The angel leads them where the rock parts, beating his wings against the narrator's front, promising safe passage. The acclivity is relieved by steps carved in the old, simple age, but on each hand, the cliff presses close.
Entering, they hear ineffable voices singing, ""Blessed are the poor in spirit."" The narrator notes the stark contrast to hell's shrieks. They climb the holy stairs, and the narrator feels lighter, asking Virgil what heavy thing he has been lightened of. Virgil replies that when ""sin's broad characters,"" still on his temples but nearly effaced, are all erased (like one already erased), his feet will be so overcome by will that they will feel no labor, but delight.
The narrator, like one who discovers something on his head through others' gestures, stretches his right hand fingers and finds only six of the seven P's traced on his brow. Virgil smiles.

**CANTO XIII**
They reach the summit of the scale and stand on the ""second buttress of that mount which healeth him who climbs."" A cornice, like the former, girdles the hill, but its arch bends with a less ample sweep.
No shadow or image is seen; the rampart and path are smooth, reflecting only the rock's sullen hue. Virgil fears delay if they wait to question. He fixes his eyes on the sun, using his right side as a central point, turning his left aside. He invokes the ""pleasant light"" to conduct them on this new way to their bourn, saying the world owes warmth and lustre to the sun, and its beams should guide them.
They journey a short space, impelled by prompt will, about a mile. They hear invisible spirits flying toward them, courteously inviting to ""love's table."" The first voice cries, ""They have no wine."" Another comes, crying, ""I am Orestes."" A third, ""Love ye those have wrong'd you.""
Virgil explains this circuit ""knots the scourge for envy,"" and the cords are drawn by charity's correcting hand. The curb is harsher, as the narrator will hear. He tells him to fix his eyes through the air and he will see a multitude seated along the ""shelving grot."" The narrator opens his eyes and sees shadows with garments as dark as the rock. As they pass, he hears crying, ""Blessed Mary! pray for us, Michael and Peter! all ye saintly host!""
The narrator believes no one on earth is so remorseless as not to pity the sight he next sees. His eyes teem with sorrow. He is so near he sees their semblances clearly. Their covering seems vile sackcloth. One stays another, leaning, and all lean against the cliff, like blind beggars near confessionals, their heads sunk on fellows, to stir compassion not by words alone, but by sight of misery. Heaven is a niggard of its light to them, for ""a thread of wire, impiercing, knits them up"" through the orbs of all, like for taming a hawk.
The narrator thinks it wrong to pass and look without being seen. He turns to Virgil, who, knowing his mute appeal, says, ""Speak; and be brief, be subtle in thy words.""
Virgil comes to the part of the cornice with no rim. On the other side are the spirits, bathing their cheeks with penitential tears that force a way through the impalement.
The narrator turns to them and says, ""O shades!... Assur'd that to your eyes unveil'd shall shine The lofty light, sole object of your wish, So may heaven's grace clear whatsoe'er of foam Floats turbid on the conscience... As ye declare... if any soul Of Latium dwell among ye; and perchance That soul may profit, if I learn so much.""
A voice replies, ""My brother, we are each one citizens of one true city. Any thou wouldst say, who lived a stranger in Italia's land.""
The narrator notices a spirit with an expectant look, chin raised like one bereft of sight. He asks the spirit, ""who for thy rise are tutoring,"" to disclose himself by place or name.
It replies, ""I was... of Sienna: here I cleanse away with these the evil life, soliciting with tears that He, who is, vouchsafe him to us. Though Sapia nam'd, in sapience I excell'd not, gladder far of others' hurt, than of the good befell me."" To prove she does not deceive, she recounts her folly: when her years waned, her fellow citizens met enemies near Colle. She prayed God to grant what He had willed. They were vanquished and fled. She marked the hunt and, glad beyond bounds, lifted her shameless brow, crying, ""It is over. Heav'n! I fear thee not."" At life's verge, she wished for peace with God, and her repentance would not have supplied her lack of duty had not the hermit Piero, touched with charity, prayed for her.
She asks who the narrator is, walking with ""lids unclos'd"" and breathing. The narrator replies his eyes ""may yet be here ta'en from me; but not long; for they have not offended grievously with envious glances. But the woe beneath urges my soul with more exceeding dread. That nether load already weighs me down.""
Sapia asks, ""Who then amongst us here aloft hath brought thee, if thou weenest to return?"" The narrator replies, ""He, who standeth mute beside me. I live: of me ask therefore, chosen spirit, if thou desire I yonder yet should move for thee my mortal feet."" Sapia replies this is so strange a thing, it is a great sign God loves him. She asks him to assist her with his prayer and, by what he most covets, to save her fame among her kindred if his feet ever tread Tuscan soil. She adds he will behold her kindred with ""that vain multitude, who set their hope on Telamone's haven, there to fail confounded, more shall when the fancied stream they sought of Dian call'd: but they who lead their navies, more than ruin'd hopes shall mourn.""

**CANTO XIV**
Two spirits bending to each other discuss the narrator: ""Say who is he around our mountain winds, or ever death has prun'd his wing for flight, that opes his eyes and covers them at will?"" They urge the other to gently accost him. Both then address the narrator, leaning back their faces.
One asks, ""O soul, who yet Pent in the body, tendest towards the sky! For charity, we pray thee' comfort us, Recounting whence thou com'st, and who thou art: For thou dost make us at the favour shown thee Marvel, as at a thing that ne'er hath been.""
The narrator begins, ""There stretches through the midst of Tuscany, a brooklet, whose well-head Springs up in Falterona, with his race Not satisfied, when he some hundred miles Hath measur'd."" He says he brings his frame from its banks. To tell who he is would be misspent words, for his name ""scarce sounds on rumour's lip.""
The first spirit interprets, ""thou dost speak of Arno's wave."" The other asks why he concealed the river's title as one would ""some horrible thing."" The first spirit replies he doesn't know, but it is fitting the valley's name should perish. He describes how from the source where the Alpine steep teems, to where the ocean is restored, ""virtue is worried down"" like a snake, either by disastrous influence or misguided wills. Thus, in the ""miserable vale,"" nature is transformed, as if they ""had shar'd of Circe's feeding."" He describes its inhabitants as swine, then curs, then wolves, then foxes replete with craft. He reveals that the narrator's grandson will become a hunter of those wolves on the fierce stream's shore, selling their living flesh, then dooming them to slaughter like aged beasts. He will reave many of life, but himself of worth, leaving such havoc that it will not spread to prime lustihood again in a thousand years.
The spirit who listened changes looks, perturbed by tidings of woe. His visage and the other's speech make the narrator desire their names. He meekly inquires.
The first shade replies, ""Thy wish imports that I vouchsafe to do For thy sake what thou wilt not do for mine. But since God's will is that so largely shine His grace in thee, I will be liberal too."" He identifies himself as Guido of Duca. Envy so parched his blood that he turned livid at another's joy. He wonders why man places his heart where exclusion of participants in good is needed. He introduces the other spirit as Rinieri, ""the boast and honour of the house of Calboli,"" where no heritage of his worth remains.
He laments that not only his blood but others between the Po, the mount, the Reno, and the shore have been stripped of bliss. Such a growth of ""rank and venom'd roots"" has sprung up, mocking culture's toil. He asks where good Lizio, Manardi, Traversalo, and Carpigna are. He calls the new generations ""bastard slips of old Romagna's line."" He points out that in Bologna, the low artisan, and in Faenza, Bernardin sprout as ""a gentle cyon from ignoble stem."" He weeps recalling the loved names, Guido of Prata, Azzo, Tignoso, Traversaro's house, Anastagio's, and the ladies and knights who bewitched them into love and courtesy, where now malice reigns. He asks why Brettinoro tarries, as its family is gone. He praises Bagnacavallo for ending his lineage but condemns Castracaro and Conio for propagating a race of Counts from their blood. He says Pagani will do well when their ""demon child"" tries. He tells Hugolin of Fantolini his name is safe as none is expected to cloud its lustre. He then tells the narrator to go, for he takes more delight in weeping than in words, such pity has wrung his heart.
They know the gentle spirits heard their steps, and their silence assures them. As they leave, a voice like lightning cries, ""Whosoever finds will slay me,"" then flees. Another voice crashes, ""Mark in me Aglauros turn'd to rock."" The narrator draws closer to Virgil.
The air rests in mute stillness. Virgil explains, ""There was the galling bit. But your old enemy so baits his hook, He drags you eager to him. Hence nor curb Avails you, nor reclaiming call."" Heaven calls and courts their gaze with beauties, yet their eye turns to earth. Therefore, God smites them.

**CANTO XV**
The narrator describes the sun's journey, which has less than a third remaining to its western goal. Evening is there, and midnight here. The sun's beams strike their forehead directly. Due to their path circling the mountain, they journey toward sunset. The narrator feels a weight of ""exceeding splendour"" press his front, causing amaze. He shields his eyes with his hands, clipping the diminished orb. He compares the refracted light to rays striking water or a mirror.
He asks Virgil what this is, ""gainst which I strive to shield the sight in vain?"" and ""which towards us moving seems?"" Virgil replies not to marvel if the ""family of heav'n"" dims his sense, for it is a messenger inviting man's ascent. Such sights, not grievous, will soon bring delight as his perception rises to their pitch.
The angel hails them with glad voice: ""Here enter on a ladder far less steep than ye have yet encounnter'd."" Ascending, they hear chanted sweetly, ""Blessed the merciful,"" and ""happy thou! That conquer'st.""
The narrator and Virgil go alone, and the narrator asks Virgil what Romagna's spirit meant by ""bliss exclusive with no partner shar'd."" Virgil replies it's no wonder he chides others, knowing the sorrow of his own defect. He explains that because men point their wishes at a mark where communion lessens part, ""envy bloweth up the sighs."" No fear of that would touch them if love of a higher sphere exalted desire, ""for there, by how much more they call it ours, So much propriety of each in good Increases more, and heighten'd charity Wraps that fair cloister in a brighter flame.""
The narrator feels less satisfied and more doubtful, asking how good distributed makes many richer than if shared by few. Virgil replies his mind, reverting to earth, ""strikes darkness from true light."" The ""highest good unlimited, ineffable,"" speeds to love, giving as much ardor as it finds. The ""sempiternal effluence"" streams wherever charity extends. So, the more aspirants to bliss are multiplied, ""more good is there to love, and more is lov'd; as mirrors, that reflect, each unto other, propagated light."" If his words don't satisfy, Beatrice will resolve his doubts fully. He must ensure his five scars (P's) are erased.
The narrator says Virgil contents him, when he finds they have gained the next round, and wonder keeps him mute. He suddenly seems rapt away by an ecstatic vision. He sees a crowd in a temple, and a dame (Mary) at the entrance saying, ""Child! why hast thou dealt with us thus? Behold thy sire and I sorrowing have sought thee."" The vision flees. Next, a female (Lavinia) appears, weeping, saying, ""If thou, Pisistratus, be lord indeed over this city... Avenge thee of those arms, whose bold embrace hath clasp'd our daughter."" Her sovereign (Pisistratus) replies benignly, ""How shall we those requite, who wish us evil, if we thus condemn the man that loves us?"" After that, he sees a multitude burning in fury, stoning a youth (Stephen), who bows to the ground yet lifts his eyes to heaven, praying forgiveness for his foes.
His spirit returns from its flight, and he observes that his vision was not unreal. Virgil, seeing him struggling to shake off sleep, exclaims, ""What ails thee, that thou canst not hold Thy footing firm... Like to a man by wine or sleep o'ercharg'd?""
The narrator tells Virgil what appeared to him. Virgil replies that even with a hundred vizards, his thoughts could not elude him. He explains the vision was shown ""that freely thou mightst ope thy heart to the waters of peace,"" not asking ""what ails thee"" to discern his state, but to give fresh vigor to his foot. Such goads the slow and loitering need.
They journey on, gazing at the evening sky. A fog, dark as night, gathers toward them. There is no room for escaping, and the mist bereaves them of sight and pure air.

**CANTO XVI**
Hell's gloom or unlustrous night never spread a veil as thick, palpable, and gross as this fog. Entering its shade, the narrator cannot endure it with unclosed lids. Virgil draws near, offering his shoulder for support.
The narrator journeys through the ""bitter air and foul,"" listening to Virgil's warning, ""Look that from me thou part not."" He hears voices, each praying for peace and compassion to the ""Lamb of God that taketh sins away."" Their prelude is ""Agnus Dei,"" and through the choir, one voice, one measure. The narrator asks if these are spirits. Virgil confirms they are those who ""loose the bonds of wrath.""
One voice asks, ""Now who art thou, that through our smoke dost cleave? And speak'st of us, as thou thyself e'en yet Dividest time by calends?"" Virgil tells the narrator to reply and ask if the passage leads upward.
The narrator addresses the spirit, ""O being! who dost make thee pure, to stand beautiful once more in thy Maker's sight! Along with me: and thou shalt hear and wonder."" The spirit replies, ""Long as 't is lawful for me, shall my steps follow on thine; and since the cloudy smoke Forbids the seeing, hearing in its stead Shall keep us join'd.""
The narrator states that he, in his mortal body, ascends to higher regions, coming through the ""fearful agony of hell."" If God has granted him such grace to behold His kingly state, he asks the spirit to reveal who he was before death and if he tends correctly to the pass.
The spirit replies he was ""of Lombardy, and Marco call'd: Not inexperienc'd of the world, that worth I still affected, from which all have turn'd The nerveless bow aside."" He confirms the narrator's course tends right to the summit and asks for prayers when the narrator comes aloft.
The narrator pledges to perform what he requests, but expresses a doubt that sorely wrings him. He notes that Virgil's opinion now doubles his previous doubt that the world is so forlorn of good and swarms with evil. He asks for the cause, as some place it in heaven, some on earth.
Marco sighs and begins, ""Brother! the world is blind; And thou in truth com'st from it."" He explains that those who live refer all causes to heaven, ""E'en as its motion of necessity Drew with it all that moves."" If this were so, free choice would be none, nor justice joy for virtue, woe for ill. He asserts that human movements have their ""primal bent from heaven; Not all; yet said I all;"" but they still have ""Light... to follow evil or good, And of the will free power, which... Conquers at last... triumphant over all."" Subject to mightier force and better nature, they abide free, not constrained by stars. If mankind errs, the cause is within themselves.
He explains that the soul, from God's hand, comes like a babe, artless and ignorant, save that its Maker dwells with gladness. It willingly turns to whatever yields joy, tastes ""some slight good,"" and pursues it fondly if no guide or rein directs it. Hence, law and a sovereign were needed to mark ""the fortress and main tower of the true city."" Laws exist, but none observe them, not even the shepherd (Pope) who ""chews the cud but doth not cleave the hoof"" (i.e., is not truly clean). Thus, the multitude, seeing their guide strike at the very good they covet, feed there and look no further. The cause is not corrupted nature, but ""ill-conducting, that hath turn'd the world to evil.""
Rome once boasted two suns (Empire and Papacy) that cast light on both the world's and God's way. One (Papacy) has since quenched the other, and ""the sword Is grafted on the crook; and so conjoin'd Each must perforce decline to worse, unaw'd by fear of other."" He tells the narrator to mark the blade (sword) if he doubts.
He says the land where Adige and Po roll was once of courtesy and valor, before Frederick's time. Now, those who have left to talk with good men or frequent their haunts may pass limits securely. Three aged ones remain, Gherardo, Conrad, and Guido of Castello, who ""chide the new"" time and wish for a better world. He concludes, ""The church of Rome, Mixing two governments that ill assort, Hath miss'd her footing, fall'n into the mire, And there herself and burden much defil'd.""
The narrator tells Marco his arguments convince him, and he understands why Levi's offspring received no heritage. He asks who Gherardo is, a sample of the perished race. Marco replies the narrator's words deceive or try him if he, speaking Tuscan, has not heard of ""good Gherardo."" He says he knows him only by that, unless he borrowed another name from his daughter Gaia. Marco then bids them farewell, for dawn gleams, and he must away before the angel appears. He would not hear more.

**CANTO XVII**
The narrator recalls how he was once enveloped by cloud on a mountaintop, seeing no better than a mole. Then, as the vapors melted, the sun's sphere seemed wading. So he first re-beheld the sun, which was now overhanging its bed.
He reflects on the ""quick and forgetive power"" of fantasy that sometimes robs them of themselves. He wonders what moves it, if not the senses. Perhaps light kindled in heaven or gliding down by divine will. Portrayed before him came traces of impiety of Procne, changed to a bird. His mind was so wrapped he gave no place to external thoughts.
Next, a crucified shape appeared in his fantasy, visage speaking ""fell rancour, malice deep,"" dying amidst Ahasuerus, Esther, and Mordecai. This vision burst like a bubble. Then a damsel appeared, weeping loud, crying, ""O queen! O mother! wherefore has intemperate ire Driv'n thee to loath thy being? Not to lose Lavinia, desp'rate thou hast slain thyself. Now hast thou lost me. I am she, whose tears Mourn, ere I fall, a mother's timeless end."" (Amata, Lavinia's mother, committing suicide).
As sleep breaks off with sudden radiance, so the imagery vanished when light struck his face. He turns to survey his location, hearing a voice exclaim, ""Here ye mount,"" leaving him no other purpose but to gaze. His virtue fails, unequal to the light. Virgil explains this is a ""Spirit from above, who marshals us our upward way, unsought; And in his own light shrouds him."" He says they must not refuse to ascend quickly before it darkens, as they may not then until morning.
Virgil leads them, and at the first stair, the narrator perceives the waving of a wing that fans his face and whispers, ""Blessed they The peacemakers: they know not evil wrath.""
The sun's last beams are high above, and night close behind. The narrator feels his sinews slacken. They reach the summit and are fixed like a bark at land. Waiting, he asks Virgil what guilt is purged on this circle. Virgil replies, ""The love of good, whate'er wanted of just proportion, here fulfils. Here plies afresh the oar, that loiter'd ill.""
To understand clearly, Virgil explains that no being, creator or created, was ever without love, either natural or of the free spirit. Natural love is without error, but the other swerves if bent on ill objects, or through excess or defect of vigor. When it seeks primal blessings or inferior ones with due measure, no delight partakes of ill. But if it warps to evil, or pursues good with too much or too little ardor, ""the thing created then Works 'gainst its Maker."" Hence, love is the ""germin of each virtue"" and each act meriting pain.
Since love intends the welfare of the loved thing, all are secure from self-hatred. And no being can exist apart from the first, so they are restrained from hating God.
Granting this, the evil must be another's which is loved. Such love is gendered three ways: one hopes for preeminence by depressing a neighbor's worth; one fears loss of power, fame, favor, or glory if a fellow rises, and loves their opposite; one thirsts for vengeance due to wrong or insult, and must dote on another's evil. This ""threefold love is mourn'd"" here.
He then instructs on the other sort of love that follows good with disordered course. All indistinctly apprehend bliss and yearn for it, striving to tend to that bourn. If they behold or seek it with ""a love remiss and lax,"" this cornice lays its penal torment on them. Other good exists, where man does not find happiness; it is not true fruition. Love too lavishly bestowed on this is mourned along three circles above them. He will not account for that tripartite division, finding it fitter for the narrator's own research.

**CANTO XVIII**
Virgil ends his discourse, inquiring if the narrator is content. The narrator, still thirsty to hear, is mute outwardly but inwardly fears his questioning offends. Virgil, a ""true father,"" marks his secret wish and gives him boldness to speak. The narrator states his sight gathers lively virtue from Virgil's beams, making his words distinct. He asks Virgil, whom his heart holds dearest, to unfold love, the source of good deeds and their opposite.
Virgil replies, ""To what I now disclose be thy clear ken Directed, and thou plainly shalt behold How much those blind have err'd, who make themselves The guides of men."" The soul, created apt to love, moves whichever way something pleasing prompts her once wakened by pleasure. Their apprehension forms a counterfeit, presenting an ideal shape that attracts the soul. If she inclines toward it, ""love is that inclining, and a new nature knit by pleasure in ye."" Like fire seeking its birthplace, the captive soul enters desire, which rests not before enjoying the loved thing. This shows how truth is hidden from those who say all love is praiseworthy in itself, for though its substance seems good, good wax doesn't guarantee a good impression.
The narrator replies Virgil's words and his docile mind reveal ""what love is."" But new doubts arise: if love is offered from without, and the spirit knows no other footing, whether it tends right or wrong is no desert of hers.
Virgil replies he can show what reason discovers, but what lies beyond must be expected from Beatrice, as it's faith's task, not reason's. He explains that spirit, ""substantial form, with matter join'd Not in confusion mix'd,"" has specific virtue from that union, felt only when it works, as vegetable life by a green leaf. Man knows not whence his intellect deduces primal notices or his appetites their first affections, like bees gathering honey; at first, volition merits neither blame nor praise. But supreme over lower faculties, man has a virtue whose ""just voice uttereth counsel,"" which should keep ""the threshold of assent."" This is the source of merit, taking or severing affections as chaff is winnowed. Men reasoning profoundly marked this innate freedom, leaving their moral teaching to the world. He grants that all love arises from necessity, but the power to dismiss or harbor it is in themselves. He reminds him that Beatrice calls free choice ""the noble virtue.""
The moon, belated near midnight, makes stars wink and fade, its broad disk like a crag on fire. The weight on the narrator's thought is lightened by Virgil.
As his questions receive solution, the narrator muses in dreary slumber. But he does not slumber long, for a multitude rushes upon them, turning the steep, with fury and random rout, like Ismenus and Asopus echoing for Thebes, impelled by eagerness of holy love.
The crowd overtakes them swiftly. Two spirits at their head cry weeping, ""Blessed Mary sought with haste the hilly region. Caesar to subdue Ilerda, darted in Marseilles his sting, and flew to Spain."" Others shout, ""Oh tarry not: away; let not time be lost through slackness of affection. Hearty zeal to serve reanimates celestial grace.""
Virgil addresses them, ""O ye, in whom intenser fervency Haply supplies, where lukewarm erst ye fail'd, Slow or neglectful, to absolve your part Of good and virtuous, this man, who yet lives, (Credit my tale, though strange) desires t' ascend, So morning rise to light us. Therefore say Which hand leads nearest to the rifted rock?""
A shade replies, ""Come after us, and thou shalt find the cleft. We may not linger: such resistless will Speeds our unwearied course. Vouchsafe us then Thy pardon, if our duty seem to thee Discourteous rudeness."" He identifies himself: ""In Verona I Was abbot of San Zeno, when the hand Of Barbarossa grasp'd Imperial sway, That name, ne'er utter'd without tears in Milan."" He predicts one with ""one foot in his grave"" will soon weep for that monastery, ruining his misused power by setting his ill-compact, worse-minded, evil-born son in place of its true pastor. Whether he spoke more or was mute, the narrator knows not, for he sped far beyond them.
Virgil points out two more chiding their sin with sharp remorse in the rear of the troop. They shout, ""First they died, to whom the sea Opened, or ever Jordan saw his heirs: And they, who with Aeneas to the end Endur'd not suffering, for their portion chose Life without glory."" (This refers to slothful Israelites and Trojans). As they flee past sight, new thoughts rise in the narrator, followed by others, until his eyes close, and meditation changes to dream.

**CANTO XIX**
At the hour when no heat relics chafe the moon's cold beams, and the geomancer sees his ""Greater Fortune"" ascend the east, the narrator dreams of a stammering, aslant-eyed, distorted-footed, maimed-handed, pale woman's shape. He looks upon her, and his gaze cheers her, unloosing her tongue, raising her decrepit form erect, and illuminating her faded face with love's hue. Recovering speech, she warbles a strain that enthralls him. She sings, ""I am the Siren, she, whom mariners On the wide sea are wilder'd when they hear: Such fulness of delight the list'ner feels. I from his course Ulysses by my lay Enchanted drew. Whoe'er frequents me once Parts seldom; so I charm him, and his heart Contented knows no void.""
Before her mouth closes, a dame of holy semblance appears, shaming her. With stern voice, she asks Virgil, ""Say, O Virgil, who is this?"" Virgil approaches, eyes on the goodly presence. The other dame seizes the Siren, tearing her robes, opening her before, and showing her belly, from which a loathsome smell exhales, waking the narrator.
He turns, and Virgil says he has called him thrice, urging him to rise and find the opening. The narrator rises. Day fills the sacred mountain's circuits. They journey on, the early ray striking their shoulder. The narrator follows, stooping his forehead like a man burdened with thought. He hears, ""Come, enter here,"" in a soft, mild tone.
An angelic shape with swan-like wings marshals them along where the sloping walls retire. Fanning them, he affirms that those who mourn are blessed, for comfort shall be theirs.
Virgil asks why the narrator still looks to earth. The narrator replies a ""New vision"" has raised strange surmises and anxious doubts. Virgil asks if he has seen the ""old enchantress"" (Siren) for whom spirits weep, and how man may free himself. He tells him to spurn earth, fix his ken on the lure of heaven. The narrator, like a falcon, looks down, then to the sky, eager for the food. So he journeys onward as the rock gives way, until the plain is reached.
On the fifth circle, a race of spirits appears, lying prone on the ground, weeping sore. They sigh, ""My soul hath cleaved to the dust."" They ask to be directed to the steep rising.
A voice replies, ""If ye approach secure from this our doom, Prostration—and would urge your course with speed, See that ye still to rightward keep the brink.""
The narrator notes what remains hidden from them, then looks to Virgil, who interprets their suit and beckons assent. The narrator approaches a shade whose words he heard. He asks the spirit, ""in whom repentant tears mature that blessed hour,"" to suspend his care and say who he was, why they grovel prone, and if he wishes his service in the world.
The spirit replies he will know why Heaven reverses their backs toward its cope. He identifies himself first as ""the successor of Peter,"" with a name and lineage from the stream between Chiaveri and Siestri. He learned in a month the weight of the robe of sovereignty, making other burdens seem like feathers. His conversion was late, but as Rome's pastor, he discerned ""the dream and cozenage of life,"" seeing the heart rested not there. Not enamored of that life, love of purer being kindled in his bosom. Until then, he was a soul in misery, alienate from God and covetous. Now, he is punished for his doting. He says converted spirits need such cleansing from avarice, and no direr penalty is inflicted here. As their eyes were fixed below and never lifted to loftier clime, justice has leveled them on earth. As avarice quenched their love of good, justice holds them prisoned, hand and foot, until God pleases.
The narrator stoops his knees to speak, but the spirit perceives his reverence. He asks, ""What cause hath bow'd thee thus?"" The narrator replies, ""Compunction... And inward awe of your high dignity.""
The spirit exclaims, ""Up... upon thy feet Arise: err not: thy fellow servant I, (Thine and all others') of one Sovran Power."" He refers to the gospel truth, ""'nor shall be given ill marriage',"" to explain his speech. He bids him go and linger no more, as his tarrying delays the tears he needs. He has a kinswoman on earth, Alagia, worthy in herself if ill example does not corrupt her, and she is all that remains of him.

**CANTO XX**
The narrator moves onward, Virgil leading, coasting along the vacant rock, like a man walking battlements on a narrow wall, as those on the other part wring out their ""all-infecting malady"" too closely press the verge. He curses the ""inveterate wolf"" (Avarice/Greed), whose maw is bottomless, and implores the spheres of heaven for the coming of one who will chase her away.
They pass with wary and slow steps, attentive to the shades lamenting and wailing. One voice cries, ""O blessed Virgin!"" like a woman in childbed, adding, ""How poor Thou wast... witness that low roof Where thou didst lay thy sacred burden down. O good Fabricius! thou didst virtue choose With poverty, before great wealth with vice.""
The narrator is pleased by these words and drawn to know the spirit. It speaks of Nicholas' gift to save maidens' prime. The narrator asks the spirit who he is and why he renews such praise, hoping for reward if he returns to life.
The spirit replies he will tell, not for hell, which he looks for, but because of the grace shining in the narrator before his dissolution. He was ""root of that ill plant"" (Capetian dynasty) whose poison spreads over Christian land, yielding seldom good fruit. He calls for vengeance, imploring heaven's Judge. He identifies himself as Hugh Capet, from whom the Philips and Louis of France descend, born of one who was a ""slaughterer"" in Paris. When the ancient kings vanished, he found the reins of empire and friends, so his son (Hugh Capet's son, Robert the Pious) was crowned.
He explains that until the ""great dower of Provence"" removed stains from their blood, their sway was narrow but wrought no evil. Then, with force and lies, rapine began, seizing Poitou, Navarre, and Gascony. Charles (Charles I of Anjou) came to Italy, slew Conradine (an innocent victim) ""for amends,"" and sent the ""angelic teacher"" (Thomas Aquinas) back to heaven ""still for amends."" He sees a future Charles (Charles of Valois) invited from France, unarmed save with the lance the arch-traitor (Judas) tilted with, to rive Florence's bowels, gaining sin and shame, not territory. He sees another (Philip IV) exposing his daughter to market like corsairs their slaves. He curses avarice for subduing their blood so they care not for their own flesh. He sees the ""flower-de-luce"" (French royal arms) enter Alagna to hide guilt, making Christ's Vicar a captive, his mockery acted again, his holy lip applied with vinegar and gall, bleeding between robbers. He calls Philip IV a ""new Pilate"" who pushes into the temple with eager sails.
Hugh Capet asks when he will rejoice to see God's vengeance. He says that during daylight, the Virgin's spouse (Joseph) is the theme of their prayers, but at night, they utter different strains, recalling Pygmalion (made traitor, robber, parricide by gold), Midas (greedy wish mocked), and Achan (stole prey, pursued by Joshua's ire). They blame Sapphira and her husband and praise the forefeet that spurned Heliodorus. The mountain rings with the infamy of Thracia's king (Polymnestor), who slew his Phrygian charge. Lastly, a shout ascends, ""Declare, O Crassus! for thou know'st, The flavour of thy gold."" Each voice is led through many pitches. He says he did not singly rehearse the blessedness they speak of by day because no one near him raised their accent.
They now depart from him, striving to surmount the way. The narrator feels the mountain tremble, like nodding to its fall, an icy chill seizing him as if conveyed to death. He compares it to Delos shaking.
A vehement shout arises from every side. Virgil draws near, crying, ""Doubt not, while I conduct thee."" All shout, ""Glory! Glory in the highest be to God."" They stand immovable like shepherds hearing the song in Bethlehem. When the trembling and song cease, they resume their hallowed path, eyeing the prostrate shadows who renew their mourning. The narrator's ignorance struggles with desire for knowledge. He dares not question nor discern, proceeding in thoughtfulness and dread.

**CANTO XXI**
The narrator's natural thirst, quenched only from the well of the Samaritan woman, impels him to haste after Virgil. Pity moves his bosom for the ""vengeful deed, though just.""
Luke relates Christ appearing to two on their way from the tomb. Similarly, a shade appears behind them, approaching, contemplating the crowd beneath its feet. Unaware, they hear it say, ""God give you peace, my brethren!"" They turn. Virgil returns a fitting salute, crying, ""Peace in the blessed council be thy lot Awarded by that righteous court, which me To everlasting banishment exiles!""
The shade exclaims, ""How!"" without stopping, asking, ""If that ye be spirits, whom God Vouchsafes not room above, who up the height Has been thus far your guide?"" Virgil replies that the tokens the narrator bears, traced by the angel's finger, show he must share in the kingdom of the just. But since the wheel (Fortune) has not yet spun the yarn of his mortal dissolution, his soul (sister to Virgil's and the shade's) could not mount of itself. Virgil was taken from hell's ample gulf to lead him as far as his lore avails. He asks the shade why the mount shook and trembled earlier and why all shouted.
The narrator feels his thirst abate from expectation. The shade replies, ""In its devotion nought irregular This mount can witness, or by punctual rule Unsanction'd; here from every change exempt."" No influence other than what heaven receives can reach them. No tempest, shower, hail, snow, frost, or dew falls higher than the three steps (of the gate of Purgatory). No thick clouds, lightning, or rainbows are seen above. Vapor does not mount above the highest stair where Peter's vicegerent stands. Below, the soil trembles with various motion, but here, through ""wind in earth's deep hollow pent,"" it never trembled until ""any spirit feels itself so purified, that it may rise, or move For rising,"" and then loud acclaim ensues. Purification is proved by the will alone, free to change society, seizing the soul in joy. Desire of bliss is present from the first, but strong ""propension"" (to sin) hinders it, opposed by heaven's ordinance. This propension is now eager to fulfill allotted torment as it was to sin. The shade states he had lain in this punishment for ""Five hundred years and more"" but now feels a ""free wish for happier clime."" Therefore, the mountain trembled, and the spirits praised their liege Lord. The narrator is filled with content.
Virgil, the sage, then says, ""Now... I see the net That takes ye here, and how the toils are loos'd, Why rocks the mountain and why ye rejoice."" He asks the shade who he was on earth and why he was prostrate for so long.
The shade replies that ""In that time, When the good Titus... Aveng'd those piteous gashes, whence the blood By Judas sold did issue,"" he was ""abundantly renown'd"" with the ""name Most lasting and most honour'd,"" though ""not yet with faith endued."" His ""vocal Spirit"" was so sweet that Rome drew him from Tolosa, where he merited a myrtle garland. ""Statius they name me still. Of Thebes I sang, And next of great Achilles: but i' th' way Fell with the second burthen."" He says the sparks of his poetic flame were derived from the ""bright fountain of celestial fire"" (Virgil's Aeneid), which was his nurse and authority. He would abide ""the revolution of another sun"" (another 500 years) in banishment to have lived coeval with Virgil.
Virgil turns to the narrator, enjoining silence by his countenance. But the will bears not supreme control; laughter and tears follow passion. The narrator smiles, winking. The shade breaks off, peering into his eyes, asking why a smile beamed across his visage.
The narrator is ""straite'd,"" one side (Virgil) binding silence, the other (the shade) conjuring him to speak. He sighs. Virgil tells him to speak and tell what the shade asks. The narrator explains that he marvels at his smiling, but there is ""room for yet more wonder."" He reveals that Virgil, who guides his ken on high, is the Mantuan by whom the shade ""didst presume of men and gods to sing."" If the shade deemed another cause for his smile, he should believe the narrator's words about Virgil are the true cause.
The shade bends down to embrace Virgil's feet, but Virgil forbids him, ""Brother! do it not: Thou art a shadow, and behold'st a shade."" The shade rises and replies, ""Now hast thou prov'd The force and ardour of the love I bear thee, When I forget we are but things of air, And as a substance treat an empty shade.""

**CANTO XXII**
They leave the angel who turned their steps to the sixth circle, one Gash (P) from the narrator's forehead erased. Those whose wishes tend to justice shout, ""Blessed!"" ending with, ""I thirst."" The narrator, more nimble, journeys without toil, following the swift-footed shades.
Virgil begins: ""Let its pure flame From virtue flow, and love can never fail To warm another's bosom' so the light Shine manifestly forth."" He explains that since the spirit of Aquinum's bard (Thomas Aquinas) came among them in the deep and told of Statius's (the shade's) affection, Virgil's goodwill has been as strong as for one unseen. These stairs will seem short. He asks Statius, as a friend, how ""covetous desire could find Place in that bosom, 'midst such ample store Of wisdom.""
Statius, somewhat moved to laughter, replies each syllable is a dear pledge of love. He says things appear that minister false matters when true causes are removed. Virgil's question assures him he believes Statius was covetous, perhaps because he found him in that circle (where avarice is punished). Statius declares he was ""too wide of avarice,"" and for that excess, thousands of moons have waxed and waned on his sufferings. Had he not heeded Virgil's exclamation against the ""cursed thirst of gold,"" he would have met ""the fierce encounter of the voluble rock"" (the opposite punishment, for prodigality). He realized his hands could hasten to lavishment and turned from this evil in penitence. He notes how many with shorn locks (prodigals) will rise from their graves, having not repented this offense in ignorance. The fault directly opposite to any sin wastes its ""green rankness on one common heap."" Therefore, if he was with the avaricious, it was to cleanse himself through reverse of their transgression.
Virgil asks Statius, ""While thou didst sing that cruel warfare wag'd By the twin sorrow of Jocasta's womb, From thy discourse with Clio there, it seems As faith had not been shine: without the which Good deeds suffice not. And if so, what sun Rose on thee, or what candle pierc'd the dark That thou didst after see to hoist the sail, And follow, where the fisherman had led?""
Statius replies: ""By thee conducted first, I enter'd the Parnassian grots, and quaff'd Of the clear spring; illumin'd first by thee Open'd mine eyes to God."" He credits Virgil as one who, journeying through darkness, hears a light behind that profits him not but makes followers wise, when he exclaimed, ""Lo! A renovated world! Justice return'd! Times of primeval innocence restor'd! And a new race descended from above!"" Statius owes to Virgil being both poet and Christian. He promises to inform his lines with livelier coloring. He says that soon, messengers from heaven spread true belief, and Virgil's word accorded with new instructors. Induced by this, Statius resorted to them, and their sanctity won him over. During Domitian's rage, he mixed his tears with theirs and succored them, their righteous customs making him scorn other sects. He was baptized before leading the Greeks in fiction, but secretly remained Christian through fear, conforming to Pagan rites. For that lukewarmness, he paced the fourth circle for ""Five centuries and more.""
He asks Virgil, who has raised the covering from this blessing, if he knows where old Terence, Caecilius, Plautus, and Varro bide, if condemned, and in what province of the deep. Virgil replies, ""These... with Persius and myself, And others many more, are with that Greek, Of mortals, the most cherish'd by the Nine, In the first ward of darkness."" There they converse about the mount where their nurses live. He names Pella's bard (Alexander the Great), Teian (Anacreon), Agatho, Simonides, and other Greeks. He mentions Antigone, Deiphile, Argia, Ismene, and the one who showed Langia's wave (Hypsipyle). Deidamia with her sisters, blind Tiresias' daughter (Manto), and Peleus' sea-born bride (Thetis) are also there.
Both poets are silent, no longer obstructed by ascent or steep walls, casting inquiring eyes. Four handmaids of the day have finished, and the fifth is at the chariot-beam. Virgil suggests they bend their right shoulder, circling the mount as usual. Custom guides them.
They go before, the narrator following, listening to their speech of ""Mysterious lessons of sweet poesy."" But they cease. Midway, they find a tree with goodly fruit, pleasant to smell. It spreads less ample downward, so none can climb aloft. From the side closing their path, a liquid crystal falls from the rock, showering through sprays. The bards draw near. A voice from the leaves says, ""Ye shall be chary of me;"" and adds, ""Mary took more thought For joy and honour of the nuptial feast, Than for herself who answers now for you. The women of old Rome were satisfied With water for their beverage. Daniel fed On pulse, and wisdom gain'd. The primal age Was beautiful as gold; and hunger then Made acorns tasteful, thirst each rivulet Run nectar. Honey and locusts were the food, Whereon the Baptist in the wilderness Fed, and that eminence of glory reach'd And greatness, which the' Evangelist records.""

**CANTO XXIII**
The narrator's eyes are fixed on the green leaf like one chasing trifles. Virgil warns, ""Son! our time Asks thriftier using. Linger not: away.""
The narrator turns his face and steps toward the sages, cheered by their converse, feeling no toil. He hears weeping and a song, ""My lips, O Lord!"" mingled to create pleasure and pain. He asks Virgil what he hears. Virgil replies, ""Spirits... who as they go, perchance, Their debt of duty pay.""
Thoughtful pilgrims overtaking strangers turn and look but do not stay. Similarly, a crowd of silent, devout spirits approaches from behind with speedier motion, eyeing them. Their eyes are dark and hollow, their visages pale and lean, bones staring through skin, dryer and meagrer than Erysichthon pinched by famine.
The narrator muses, ""Lo! the race, who lost Jerusalem, when Mary with dire beak Prey'd on her child."" Their sockets seem like rings without gems. The letter M is traced plainly on their foreheads. He wonders how the scent of water and an apple could cause such pining want.
A spirit turns his deeply sunken eyes on the narrator, crying vehemently, ""What grace is this vouchsaf'd me?"" The narrator recognizes the voice of Forese, not his looks. Remembrance is kindled from that spark. Forese implores respect for his ""wan and leprous wither'd skin... this macerated flesh."" He asks the narrator to speak truly of himself and who his escorts are.
The narrator replies that Forese's face, which he once bewailed as dead, now makes him weep at its transformation. He asks by Heaven what blasts them, deferring his own speech.
Forese explains, ""The water and tee plant we pass'd, Virtue possesses, by th' eternal will Infus'd, the which so pines me."" Every spirit who bewails gluttony is here purified by hunger and thirst. The odor of the fruit and spray inflames them with desire. They encompass their route not once alone to add fuel to pain, but it is solace, for that will leads them to the tree by which Christ was led to call Elias when he paid ransom.
The narrator replies that not five years have passed since Forese changed worlds. If he had finished sinning before knowing kindly grief, how did he come so soon? The narrator expected to find him lower, where time is recompense for time.
Forese replies he was brought early by his Nella's tears and devout prayers, which drew him from the coast of lingering expectation and set him free from other circles. His widow is prized by God for her virtuous deeds. He laments that Sardinia's barb'rous tract has chaster dames than Florence. He sees a time coming when Florence's unblushing dames will be warned from the pulpit against baring bosoms. He asks what savage women needed such discipline to walk with covered limbs. He prophesies that they shall taste sorrow unless foresight cheats him, before the cheek of one now rocked asleep is clothed with down. He asks the narrator to hide himself no more, as all gaze where he veils the sun.
The narrator replies that remembering their past together may still grieve him. He attributes his change of life to Virgil, who preceded him a few evenings past. He points to Virgil, saying he brought him through the ""profoundest night of the true dead"" with his flesh, aiding him to climb this mountain, which rectifies what the world made crooked. He has Virgil's word that he will accompany him to Beatrice, but must leave him there. He points out Statius as the other shade for whom their realm shook with exultation when he arose.

**CANTO XXIV**
Their journey is not slackened by talk, nor talk by journeying. They speak and travel stoutly. The shadowy forms gaze at the narrator with wonder, perceiving he has life. The narrator continues, saying he journeys perhaps more tardily for others' sake. He asks if Forese knows where Piccarda is and if he sees any notable figures among the crowd.
Forese replies, ""My sister (she for whom, 'Twixt beautiful and good I cannot say Which name was fitter) wears e'en now her crown, And triumphs in Olympus."" He explains that due to their worn semblance from diet, it is lawful to name each one. He points out Buonaggiuna of Lucca and the face beyond him, pierced to a leaner fineness, who had keeping of the church, from Tours, purging Bolsena's eels and muscadel by abstinence.
He shows many others, all seeming content when named. The narrator sees Ubaldino grind teeth on emptiness from hunger, and Boniface wave his crozier, and the Marquis of Este, who swilled at Forli with less drought, yet was never sated. The narrator singles out the one from Lucca (Buonaggiuna), who took most note of him. He hears him whisper of Gentucca, indistinctly, where justice fixes her sting.
The narrator tells the spirit he seems to wish to speak and asks to hear him. The spirit replies, ""Woman is born, Whose brow no wimple shades yet, that shall make My city please thee, blame it as they may. Go then with this forewarning. If aught false My whisper too implied, th' event shall tell."" He asks if the narrator is ""th' inventor of that new lay, which begins With 'Ladies, ye that con the lore of love'.""
The narrator replies, ""Count of me but as one Who am the scribe of love; that, when he breathes, Take up my pen, and, as he dictates, write.""
The spirit replies, ""Brother! the hind'rance which once held The notary with Guittone and myself, Short of that new and sweeter style I hear, Is now disclos'd. I see how ye your plumes Stretch, as th' inditer guides them; which, no question, Ours did not. He that seeks a grace beyond, Sees not the distance parts one style from other."" Contented, he falls silent.
Like birds near the Nile, flying in formation, the spirits turn their visage, speeding nimbly through leanness and desire. Like a man tired from a trotting steed, Forese lingers behind, asking, ""When shall I again behold thee?""
The narrator replies he knows not how long his life will last, but his wishes will arrive before him, as his city is daily scooped of good and threatened with ruin.
Forese cries, ""Go now! lo! he, whose guilt is most, Passes before my vision, dragg'd at heels of an infuriate beast."" He describes it speeding toward the ""vale, where guilt hath no redemption,"" increasing swiftness until it strikes a blow, leaving a ""corse most vilely shatter'd."" He says not long will those wheels roll before the narrator sees what his words cannot plainly tell. He quits him, saying time is precious here.
Forese departs with lengthened strides, like a knight pricking forth to display prowess, leaving the narrator with Virgil and Statius.
When Forese is beyond sight, another fruit tree, thick hung and blooming fresh, appears. As they turn toward it, a multitude below raises hands and shouts to the boughs. Like hungry children begging, denied by one who holds the desired object aloft, they are drawn on.
At length, undeceived, they go their way. They approach the tree. Sounds from the thickets say, ""Pass on, And come not near. Stands higher up the wood, Whereof Eve tasted, and from it was ta'en 'this plant'."" The narrator passes forth with both bards, close to the rising side. They then hear, ""Remember... those noblest creatures of the clouds, How they their twofold bosoms overgorg'd Oppos'd in fight to Theseus: call to mind The Hebrews, how effeminate they stoop'd To ease their thirst; whence Gideon's ranks were thinn'd.""
They hear the sins of gluttony, reguerdoned with woe. They then travel a thousand paces along the lonely path, contemplative and mute.
Suddenly, a voice exclaims, ""Why pensive journey thus ye three alone?"" The narrator shakes like a scared animal and raises his head. He sees a shape as bright and glowing red as glass or metal in a furnace. ""If ye desire to mount,"" it cries, ""here must ye turn. This way he goes, Who goes in quest of peace."" His countenance dazzles the narrator, who faces backward to his guides, walking as sound directs.
A gentle wind like May air, impregnated with fragrance, blows on his front. He perceives the moving of a wing shedding ambrosial smell, and then a voice: ""Blessed are they, whom grace Doth so illume, that appetite in them Exhaleth no inordinate desire, Still hung'ring as the rule of temperance wills.""

**CANTO XXV**
It is an hour when climbers need to walk uncrippled, as the sun has left Taurus and night left Scorpio. They enter their way, one before the other, as only singly can one climb the steep, narrow scale.
The narrator's desire to question Virgil arises and falls, like a young stork lifting its wing to fly but not venturing from the nest. Virgil, unhindered by their haste, says, ""Fear not to speed the shaft, that on thy lip Stands trembling for its flight."" Encouraged, the narrator asks, ""How there can leanness come, Where is no want of nourishment to feed?""
Virgil replies if he remembered Meleager wasting with the wasting brand, this would not trouble him. And if he thought how his reflected form vibrates in a mirror, what seems hard would appear no harder than ripe summer fruit. But to find full repose, Virgil calls on Statius to heal his wound.
Statius answers, ""If in thy presence I unfold to him The secrets of heaven's vengeance, let me plead Thine own injunction, to exculpate me."" He then begins to explain: ""Blood, concocted well, Which by the thirsty veins is ne'er imbib'd, And rests as food superfluous... in the heart Derives effectual virtue, that informs The several human limbs, as being that, Which passes through the veins itself to make them."" More concocted, it descends where shame forbids mention, and distils in a natural vessel onto another's blood. Then each unites, one to endure, the other to act, through a recipient mold. It coagulates, then vivifies what its substance caused to bear. Indued with animation, the active virtue (differing from a plant only in being on its way, not at its limit) continues to operate, moving and feeling like a sea sponge, assuming organic powers its seed conveyed. This is the period when the virtue from the generating heart is pliable and expansive, for each limb is planned in the heart by nature. He explains how an animal becomes a babe, wiser than the protagonist's error of disjoining the soul from passive intellect because he saw no organ for it.
Statius tells the narrator to open his bosom to the truth. As soon as articulation is complete in the embryo's brain, the ""primal Mover with a smile of joy"" imbreathes new spirit, replete with virtue, which draws what it finds active to its own substance, forming an individual soul that lives, feels, and reflects on itself. To marvel less, he compares it to the sun's heat changing wine, mixed with moisture filtered through the vine.
When Lachesis spins the thread, the soul takes both human and divine (memory, intelligence, will), keener than before, other powers inactive. It falls to a strand where the departed roam, learning its path. The place receives her, and the plastic virtue beams, distinct as in living limbs. Like air refracting a casual beam, the ambient air wears the form imprinted by the soul. Like flame following fire, the new form follows the spirit, hence it has ""semblance, and is shadow call'd,"" endowed with senses, speech, laughter, tears, and sighs, which the narrator may have witnessed on the mount. The obedient shadow presents whatever passion moves within them. This is the cause of what the narrator marvels at.
They reach the last flexure of their way, turning right. Other care awaits them. The rocky precipice hurls redundant flames, and an upblown blast drives them back, sequestered. They must pass one by one along the side bordering the void. The narrator fears fire on one hand, headlong fall on the other. Virgil warns, ""Strict rein must in this place direct the eyes. A little swerving and the way is lost.""
From the burning mass, the narrator hears ""O God of mercy!"" sung and feels desire to turn. He sees spirits proceeding along the flame and wishes to share his view between their footsteps and his. At the hymn's close, they shout, ""I do not know a man;"" then in low voice resume the strain. When that ends, they cry, ""To the wood... Ran Dian, and drave forth Callisto, stung With Cytherea's poison."" Then they return to their song, extolling many who lived chastely and the bonds of wedded love. They do not cease this task as long as the fire enclasps them. Such skill is needed to medicine this last-healing wound.

**CANTO XXVI**
As they walk singly along the rim, Virgil warns the narrator to look well. The sun irradiates the western clime, changing from azure to white. The narrator's shadow makes the ""umber'd flame burn ruddier."" Many spirits marvel at this strange sight, noting, ""He seems... no insubstantial frame."" They stretch toward him, careful not to pass the burning pale.
One spirit asks, ""O thou, who followest The others, haply not more slow than they, But mov'd by rev'rence, answer me, who burn In thirst and fire: nor I alone, but these All for thine answer do more thirst, than doth Indian or Aethiop for the cooling stream. Tell us, how is it that thou mak'st thyself A wall against the sun, as thou not yet Into th' inextricable toils of death Hadst enter'd?""
The narrator would have declared himself, but attention turns to a new appearance. Midway the burning path, a crowd comes, and the narrator sees the shadows press forward, each snatching a hasty kiss, then away. Like ants peering one at another, perhaps to spy their mutual road.
After this greeting, before the first step onward, loud clamor rises from either tribe. Those newly come shout, ""Sodom and Gomorrah!"" These, ""The cow Pasiphae enter'd, that the beast she woo'd Might rush unto her luxury."" Like cranes flying to Riphaean mountains or Lybic sands, one crowd hastens off, the other advances, resuming their first song weeping and their shouts.
The same spirit who asked earlier approaches, eager to listen. The narrator, having noted their will twice, speaks: ""O spirits secure, Whene'er the time may be, of peaceful end! My limbs, nor crude, nor in mature old age, Have I left yonder: here they bear me, fed With blood, and sinew-strung. That I no more May live in blindness, hence I tend aloft. There is a dame on high, who wind for us This grace, by which my mortal through your realm I bear."" He expresses hope that their wish may soon be fulfilled, that heaven's orb may receive them. He asks them to tell who they are and who the multitude is that passed behind them, so it may be recorded on his page.
Each spirit appears like a rustic, amazed in a city. But when rid of that amaze, the one who questioned replies: ""O blessed, who, for death preparing, tak'st Experience of our limits, in thy bark! Their crime, who not with us proceed, was that, For which, as he did triumph, Caesar heard The snout of 'queen,' to taunt him."" (i.e. those who committed sodomy). Hence their cry of ""Sodom,"" to rebuke themselves and aid the burning by their shame. ""Our sinning was Hermaphrodite: but we, Because the law of human kind we broke, Following like beasts our vile concupiscence, Hence parting from them, to our own disgrace Record the name of her, by whom the beast In bestial tire was acted."" He explains their deeds and sin. He says time doesn't permit naming them all. He identifies himself: ""Guinicelli I, Who having truly sorrow'd ere my last, Already cleanse me.""
The narrator feels pious joy, like two sons gazing on their mother rescued from Lycurgus, when he hears the name of his ""father"" and the father of those who use ""sweet and pleasant rhymes of love."" He listens thoughtfully, gazing on him, approaching not nearer due to the fire. When his eyes are fed, he devotes himself wholly to Guinicelli's service.
Guinicelli replies his words are deeply engraved, so Lethe shall not wash them off. He asks, since the oath has sealed the truth, what cause impels the love his looks and speech betray.
The narrator replies, ""Those dulcet lays... which, as long As of our tongue the beauty does not fade, Shall make us love the very ink that trac'd them.""
Guinicelli cries, ""Brother!"" and points to a shade before him. ""there is one, whose mother speech Doth owe to him a fairer ornament. He in love ditties and the tales of prose Without a rival stands, and lets the fools Talk on, who think the songster of Limoges O'ertops him. Rumour and the popular voice They look to more than truth, and so confirm Opinion, ere by art or reason taught. Thus many of the elder time cried up Guittone, giving him the prize, till truth By strength of numbers vanquish'd."" He asks the narrator, if he has gained free entrance to Christ's cloister, to say a Pater Noster for him. Guinicelli then vanishes through the fire like a fish.
The narrator approaches the spirit Guinicelli indicated and asks his name. He replies, ""Thy courtesy So wins on me, I have nor power nor will To hide me. I am Arnault; and with songs, Sorely lamenting for my folly past, Thorough this ford of fire I wade, and see The day, I hope for, smiling in my view. I pray ye by the worth that guides ye up Unto the summit of the scale, in time Remember ye my suff'rings."" Arnault then disappears in the refining flame.

**CANTO XXVII**
The sun is positioned as when its early radiance quivers on the heights where Christ's blood streamed (Jerusalem), while Libra hangs above the Ebro, and new fires flash on the Ganges. Day is sinking when the angel of God appears before them, joyful. He stands on the brink of the flame and sings, ""Blessed are the pure In heart,"" with a voice of lively clearness. As they approach, he cries, ""Go ye not further, holy spirits!... Ere the fire pierce you: enter in; and list Attentive to the song ye hear from thence.""
The narrator, hearing this, is like one laid in the grave. He clasps his hands, looks at the fire, and conjures forms of those consumed in flames.
Virgil turns to him with gentle looks, ""My son, Here torment thou mayst feel, but canst not death. Remember thee... if I Safe e'en on Geryon brought thee: now I come More near to God, wilt thou not trust me now? Of this be sure: though in its womb that flame A thousand years contain'd thee, from thy head No hair should perish. If thou doubt my truth, Approach, and with thy hands thy vesture's hem Stretch forth, and for thyself confirm belief. Lay now all fear... Turn hither, and come onward undismay'd."" Still, the narrator, though conscience urged, does not advance.
Virgil, seeing him fixed, cries, ""Mark now, my son, From Beatrice thou art by this wall Divided."" Like Pyramus opening his eyes at Thisbe's name as life ebbed, the narrator turns to Virgil, relenting when he hears the name of Beatrice.
Virgil shakes his forehead, asks, ""How long Linger we now?"" then smiles like one at a child eyeing fruit. He walks into the fire before the narrator, asking Statius to come behind.
The narrator wishes he could cast himself into molten glass to cool, so intense is the conflagration. Virgil, to comfort him, talks of Beatrice, saying, ""Her eyes... E'en now I seem to view."" A voice singing from the other side guides them. Following the voice, they issue forth where the path leads upward. They hear, ""Come... Come, blessed of my Father."" These sounds hail them from within a radiant light that the narrator cannot endure. The voice adds, ""The sun... hastes: and evening comes. Delay not: ere the western sky is hung With blackness, strive ye for the pass.""
Their way arises upright within the rock, facing heaven. Not many stairs are passed when they perceive the sun behind them by the fading shadow. Before one face of darkness involves the horizon, each makes a stair his pallet, not because will fails, but power, forbidden further travel by the mountain's nature. Like goats ruminating under shade at noon, or a swain guarding his flock, all three abide, the narrator as a goat and the others as shepherds, pent by rock.
A glimpse of sky is seen above, showing stars with more than wonted glory. As he gazes, sleep overcomes him, bringing tidings of future hap. Around the hour when Venus first lightened on the mountain, he dreams of a young, beautiful lady passing over a lea, culling flowers and singing: ""Know ye... I am Leah: for my brow to weave A garland, these fair hands unwearied ply. To please me at the crystal mirror, here I deck me. But my sister Rachel, she Before her glass abides the livelong day, Her radiant eyes beholding, charm'd no less, Than I with this delightful task. Her joy In contemplation, as in labour mine.""
As glimmering dawn breaks, darkness and slumber flee. The narrator rises, seeing Virgil already risen. Virgil says, ""That delicious fruit, Which through so many a branch the zealous care Of mortals roams in quest of, shall this day Appease thy hunger."" Never did the narrator hear such pleasant sounds. Desire to mount grows, and at each step, he feels wings increasing.
When they reach the ladder's top, Virgil fixes his eyes on him, saying, ""Both fires, my son, The temporal and eternal, thou hast seen, And art arriv'd, where of itself my ken No further reaches. I with skill and art Thus far have drawn thee. Now thy pleasure take For guide. Thou hast o'ercome the steeper way, O'ercome the straighter. Lo! the sun, that darts His beam upon thy forehead! lo! the herb, The arboreta and flowers, which of itself This land pours forth profuse! Till those bright eyes With gladness come, which, weeping, made me haste To succour thee, thou mayst or seat thee down, Or wander where thou wilt. Expect no more Sanction of warning voice or sign from me, Free of thy own arbitrement to choose, Discreet, judicious. To distrust thy sense Were henceforth error. I invest thee then With crown and mitre, sovereign o'er thyself.""

**CANTO XXVIII**
Through the celestial forest, whose thick shade tempers the new-springing day, the narrator eagerly roams to search its limits. He leaves the bank, leisurely pursuing his way over ground breathing delicious odor. A pleasant, never-intermitted, never-veered air smites his temples. The obedient sprays lean trembling to where the mountain casts its shade, but not so disordered that feathered quiristers do not apply their art, welcoming prime hours and warbling amid the leaves, with inept tenor. He compares it to the melody rolling through piney forests on Chiassi's shore when Aeolus loosens the south wind.
His steps, though slow, carry him so far into the wood he cannot ken where he entered. His path is bounded by a rill bending to the left with rippling waters. No earthly wave is as clean as this, transpicuous, clear, yet it rolls darkly beneath perpetual gloom, admitting no sun or moonlight.
His feet advance not, but his eyes pass over the streamlet to survey the tender May-bloom. He then beholds a lady all alone, singing and culling flowers. The narrator addresses her, ""Lady beautiful! Thou, who... with love's own beam Dost warm thee... Ah! please thee hither towards the streamlet bend Thy steps so near, that I may list thy song. Beholding thee and this fair place, methinks, I call to mind where wander'd and how look'd Proserpine, in that season, when her child The mother lost, and she the bloomy spring.""
Like a lady turning in a dance, she turns at his suit, maiden-like, veiling her eyes, and comes so near he distinctly catches her dulcet sound. Arriving where the limpid waters lave the sward, she raises her eyes, shooting splendor on him. She stands on the opposite bank and smiles, her fingers shifting the intermingling dyes which that lofty land unbosoms without seed. Only three paces separate them, yet the flood is as hateful to him as the Hellespont to Leander, because it gives no passage.
She says, ""Strangers ye come... Wond'ring, ye not without suspicion view My smiles: but that sweet strain of psalmody, 'Thou, Lord! hast made me glad,' will give ye light, Which may uncloud your minds."" She asks if he wishes to hear anything else, as she came to answer every doubt.
The narrator replies he doesn't know how to reconcile this wave and rustling sound with what he heard of opposite report (i.e. of the mountain being bare). She replies she will unfold the cause and purge the cloud that enwraps him. The ""First Good,"" whose joy is in himself, created man for happiness and gave this place as a pledge of eternal peace. Man fell through his own defect, changing laughter to sorrow. To prevent vapors from ascending to vex man's peaceful state, this mountain rose so high, exempted from elemental rage where the gate bars its limit. Because the circumambient air circles with its first impulse, it strikes the summit (open to impassive air), making the wood resound. The shaken plant impregnates the voyaging breeze, which flies abroad, and the other land receives it, conceiving and producing varied trees. This explains how some plants appear without seed on earth. This holy plain is filled with ""prolific foison of all seeds"" and bears fruit never plucked elsewhere. The water he beholds springs not from veins but from a solid, undecaying fountain, its full supply fed by omnific will. It pours on one side with power to remove remembrance of offense (Lethe), on the other to bring back remembrance of good deeds (Eunoe). Both must be tasted. She states his thirst may be content even if she stops, but she offers a corollary: poets of old may have dreamed of this place when recording the golden age. Here was man guiltless, here perpetual spring, every fruit, and the far-famed nectar.
Turning to the bards, she ceases. The narrator notes their smile. He then directs his face to the lady again.

**CANTO XXIX**
Singing, as if enamored, she resumes and closes the song with, ""Blessed they whose sins are cover'd."" Like wood-nymphs, she moves on against the current, up the verdant rivage. The narrator observes her mincing step, pursuing with as tardy a step.
Not a hundred paces separate them when she turns and cries, ""My brother! look and hearken."" A sudden lustre runs across the great forest, so bright the narrator doubts it's lightning, but it endures and waxes, and sweet melody runs through the luminous air. He chides the hardihood of ""our first parent,"" for woman, the creature of an hour, endured not restraint of any veil when earth obeyed heaven. Had she borne it devoutly, ""joys, ineffable as these, Had from the first, and long time since, been mine.""
He walks through the wilderness of ""primy sweets"" that never fade, expectant of higher beatitude. Before them, the air under green boughs glows like a blazing fire, and distinct melody is heard. He invokes the thrice-holy virgins and Helicon and Urania for aid to unfold things that mock thought.
A space onward, what seem like seven trees of gold falsely appear due to distance. Closer, his faculty distinguishes them as ""tapers of gold"" and traces ""Hosanna"" in the singing. Their garniture flames with more ample lustre than the moon.
The narrator turns to Virgil, who shows no less amazement. His view reverts to the lofty things moving so slowly that a bride would outstrip them. The lady calls aloud, ""Why thus yet burns Affection in thee for these living, lights, And dost not look on that which follows them?""
The narrator marks a tribe walking behind them, attendant on their leaders, clothed in such white raiment as never seen on earth. The watery gleam on his left reflects his left side as in a mirror.
He chooses a station on the river's edge, separated only by the stream, to gain clearer prospect. He beholds the flames go onward, painting the air behind them with trails of ""liveliest pencils,"" distinctly marked with ""sev'n listed colours"" like the sun's bow and Cynthia's zone. These streaming gonfalons flow beyond his vision. Ten paces apart, ""foul and-twenty elders,"" two by two, crowned with flower-de-luces, sing, ""Blessed be thou among The daughters of Adam! and thy loveliness Blessed for ever!"" After these, four animals follow, each crowned with verdurous leaf, with six wings full of eyes. The narrator refers to Ezekiel for their form, noting John agrees except on the pennons.
The space enclosed by the four animals holds a triumphal car, drawn by a Gryphon. The Gryphon stretches its uplifted wings between the middle and the three listed hues on each side (three on each side), rising out of sight. Its bird-like members are golden, the rest white with vermeil. This car surpasses any Roman pomp. Three nymphs circle at the right wheel: one ruddy like flame, one like emerald flesh and bones, the third like new-fallen snow. The white seems to lead, then the ruddy, and the others take their treasure (song) from her who leads. At the other wheel, a quaternion band, clad in purple, advances festively, one leading with ""Three eyes."" In rear, two old men, dissimilar in raiment but alike in port, grave. One shows himself a favored counselor of the ""great Coan"" (Hippocrates), whom nature made to serve the costliest creature. His fellow (Seneca or Ovid), bearing a sword, frightens the narrator. Next, four others of humble seeming. And behind them all, one single old man, sleeping, with a shrewd visage. These seven are like the first troop but wear no lilies, only roses and vermeil flowers.
When the car is opposite, a thundering sound is heard, staying the chosen multitude. They halt with the first ensigns.

**CANTO XXX**
The ""polar light,"" which never knows setting or rising, stands fixed. The saintly tribe before the Gryphon turns to the car. One, as if from above, shouts thrice, ""Come, spouse, from Libanus!"" and the rest take up the song. The narrator compares this to the blessed rising at the last audit. ""Blessed thou! who com'st!"" they cry, scattering ""unwith'ring lilies.""
The narrator sees at break of day the eastern clime all roseate and the sky serene. So, in a cloud of angelic flowers, a virgin appears, veiled in white with an olive wreath, beneath a green mantle, robed in living flame.
No terror creeps over his spirit, which long abode in her presence. His eyes no longer know her, yet a hidden virtue from her awakens the power of ""ancient love"" within him.
The heavenly influence, which thrilled him in childhood, smites him. He turns leftward to Virgil, panting like a babe for refuge, wanting to cry that ""no dram of blood"" does not quiver, the old flame showing tokens of reviving fire. But Virgil has gone, leaving him. His cheeks are blurred with soiling tears.
A voice says, ""Dante, weep not, that Virgil leaves thee: nay, Weep thou not yet: behooves thee feel the edge Of other sword, and thou shalt weep for that.""
Like an admiral pacing the deck, inspiring his crew, the narrator sees the virgin (Beatrice) stationed on the left side of the car, turning at the sound of his own name. Her veil, bound with Minerva's foliage, prevents him from seeing her clearly. With royal act, insulting over her thrall, she adds, ""Observe me well. I am, in sooth, I am Beatrice. What! and hast thou deign'd at last Approach the mountain? knewest not, O man! Thy happiness is whole?""
The narrator's eyes fall on the clear fount, but seeing himself, he recoils to the greensward, burdened by shame. She looks with stern majesty, like a mother to an awe-struck child, with a bitter flavor mingled in her pity. She breaks off, and the angels sing, ""In thee, O gracious Lord, my hope hath been,"" but go no further than, ""Thou Lord, hast set My feet in ample room.""
The narrator compares himself to snow melting in the sun, without a sigh or tear until the angels sing their sweet symphony, expressing soft compassion. Then the ice in his bosom turns to spirit and water, gushing forth from lips and eyelids.
Beatrice stands immovable on the chariot's right edge, addressing the pity-touched bright semblances. She states that they keep vigil in eternal day, so she shapes her answer for the weeping narrator, so his sorrow may equal his transgression. Not only through the ""mighty orbs"" and constellations, but through ""benign Largess of heav'nly graces,"" he was gifted in the freshness of his being, so all better habits thrived. The more strength in the soil, the more evil seed and lack of culture mar it. Her looks sometimes upheld him, as she showed her youthful eyes and led him by their light. But as she reached the ""threshold of my second age"" (death) and changed mortal for immortal, he left her and gave himself to others. With increased beauty and virtue, she was less dear to him. His steps turned to deceitful ways, following false images of good. Her inspirations, in dreams and otherwise, availed not. He fell so deep that nothing could preserve him except seeing ""the children of perdition."" To this end, she visited the ""purlieus of the dead,"" and one (Virgil) received her weeping supplications. She states it would be a breaking of God's decree if Lethe were passed and tasted ""Without the cost of some repentant tear.""

**CANTO XXXI**
Beatrice resumes her words, turning their point on the narrator, who previously felt them only with a lateral edge. ""Say thou, who stand'st beyond the holy stream, If this be true. A charge so grievous needs Thine own avowal."" The narrator is so amazed his voice expires imperfectly.
After a pause, she asks, ""What dost thou muse on? Answer me. The wave On thy remembrances of evil yet Hath done no injury."" A mixed sense of fear and confusion produces a ""Yea"" that needs vision to interpret. Like a crossbow over-bent, the narrator bursts beneath the heavy load with tears and sighs, his voice slackened.
She asks, ""When my desire invited thee to love The good, which sets a bound to our aspirings, What bar of thwarting foss or linked chain Did meet thee, that thou so should'st quit the hope Of further progress, or what bait of ease Or promise of allurement led thee on Elsewhere, that thou elsewhere should'st rather wait?""
The narrator draws a bitter sigh, then wailingly answers, ""Thy fair looks withdrawn, Things present, with deceitful pleasures, turn'd My steps aside."" She replies, ""Hadst thou Been silent, or denied what thou avow'st, Thou hadst not hid thy sin the more: such eye Observes it."" But when the sinner's cheek breaks into tears of self-accusing, justice's wheel runs counter to the edge in their court. To profit by his shame and arm him with strength against the Siren-voice, she bids him lay aside grief and listen as she unfolds ""how opposite a way my buried flesh should have impell'd thee."" He never spied anything so sweet in art or nature as her limbs, now scattered in dust. If the sweetest thing failed him with her death, what mortal thing should tempt his wish afterward? When he felt the dart of perishable things upon her death, he should have pruned his wing to follow her, not stooped again ""to 'bide a second blow for a slight girl, Or other gaud as transient and as vain."" The new bird awaits the fowler's aim twice or thrice, but for a full-plumed one, the net is spread in vain.
The narrator stands silent and ashamed like a child, acknowledging his fault. She resumes, ""If, but to hear thus pains thee, Raise thou thy beard, and lo! what sight shall do!""
With less reluctance than a sturdy oak is rent by a blast, the narrator raises his visage. By the beard, he notes the secret sting of her words.
No sooner does he lift his aspect than the vision of ""goodly creatures"" vanishes. His eyes, wavering, bend their light on Beatrice. She turns toward the Gryphon (the animal with two natures), and even under her veil and parted by the rill, her loveliness surpasses her former self as much as she surpassed others on earth. Remorseful goads shoot through him. Everything else that had beguiled him is now loathsome. The bitter consciousness smites his heart, and he falls to the ground. She who caused it knows his state.
When his strength returns, he finds the lady he first saw (Matilda) above him. She cries, ""Loose me not... Loose not thy hold;"" and drags him up to his neck into the stream, sweeping along swift as a shuttle.
Approaching the blessed shore, ""Tu asperges me"" is heard sung so sweetly the narrator cannot remember or tell the sound. The beautiful dame, expanding her arms, clasps his temples and immerses him where the wave should drench him. Raising him, she presents him within the ""fourfold dance of lovely nymphs,"" who cover him with their arm. They say, ""Here are we nymphs, And in the heav'n are stars."" Before Beatrice visited earth, they were appointed her handmaids. They will lead him to her eyes, but the three yonder, of deeper ken, will quicken his sight to scan the light of gladness in them.
They begin their song and lead him to the Gryphon's breast, where Beatrice stands turned toward them. ""Spare not thy vision. We have stationed thee Before the emeralds, whence love erewhile Hath drawn his weapons on thee."" As they speak, a thousand wishes rivet his eyes on her beaming eyes, fixed on the motionless Gryphon. As the sun strikes a mirror, the Gryphon's twofold being shines within Beatrice's orbs, ever varying, now reflected in one figure, now in another. The narrator muses on this wondrous sight.
Full of amaze and joy, his soul feeding on the viand, the other three nymphs, with gestures of loftier line, advance, dancing in a festive, angelic ring. They sing, ""Turn, Beatrice!... O turn Thy saintly sight on this thy faithful one, Who to behold thee many a wearisome pace Hath measur'd. Gracious at our pray'r vouchsafe Unveil to him thy cheeks: that he may mark Thy second beauty, now conceal'd."" The narrator exclaims at her splendor, beyond human representation when her charms were revealed under ""cope of the still-chiming heaven.""

**CANTO XXXII**
The narrator's eyes are bent with eager coveting to rid them of their ten years' thirst for Beatrice. No other sense is waking, and even his eyes are fenced from heed of aught else, so tangled by Beatrice's saintly smile. Forcibly, the sacred virgins turn his sight to the left, warning, ""Too fix'd a gaze!""
His vision labors like eyes strained by the sun. But soon recovering, he marks the ""glorious army"" wheel and turn on their right, facing the sun and sevenfold lights. Like a well-ranged troop with raised bucklers wheeling, the ""goodly regiment of heav'n"" passes, before the car slopes its beam. The damsels turn at the wheels, and the sacred burden on the Gryphon moves with a smooth pace. The fair dame who drew him through the wave (Matilda), accompanied by Statius and himself, pursues the wheel.
He passes through the high wood, now void. Beatrice descends from her station. All murmur ""Adam,"" circling a plant despoiled of flowers and leaves. Its tresses, spreading as they rise, are so tall Indians might gaze at them. The spirits shout, ""Blessed thou! Gryphon, whose beak hath never pluck'd that tree Pleasant to taste: for hence the appetite Was warp'd to evil."" The Gryphon replies, ""Yea: for so The generation of the just are sav'd."" Turning to the chariot-pole, he draws it to the foot of the widowed branch and binds it to the stock where it grew.
As radiance from above, mingled with that from the setting scaly sign (Scorpio), makes plants burgeon, so the plant, once bare, is renewed with a hue fainter than rose, deeper than violet.
An unearthly hymn arises. The narrator does not understand or endure its harmony. He wishes he could describe his falling into sleep. He passes to his waking, telling how a flash of splendor rends his sleep, and one cries, ""Arise, what dost thou?"" Like the chosen three on Tabor's mount, who saw the blossoming tree (Christ) and awoke to find Moses and Elias gone, so the narrator awakens to find the ""piteous one"" (Matilda) standing over him.
He exclaims, ""And where... Is Beatrice?"" She replies, ""See her... Beneath the fresh leaf seated on its root. Behold th' associate choir that circles her. The others, with a melody more sweet And more profound, journeying to higher realms, Upon the Gryphon tend."" Whether her words close here, he knows not, but his eyes now view Beatrice, barring other thoughts. She sits alone on the ground, guarding the wain bound to the twyform beast. The seven nymphs form a cloister around her, holding lights safe from winds.
Beatrice says, ""A little while thou shalt be forester here: And citizen shalt be forever with me, Of that true Rome, wherein Christ dwells a Roman."" To profit the misguided world, she tells him to keep his eyes on the car and write what he sees upon returning to the world.
The narrator, inclining at her feet, directs his thought and eyes as she bids. He sees the ""bird of Jove"" (eagle) descending with swift motion, pouncing on the tree, crushing rind, buds, and leaflets. It strikes the car, making it reel like a ship.
Next, a fox, hunger-pined, springs into the chariot's womb. But the ""saintly maid"" (Beatrice) rebukes him, and he scampers away. Then the eagle darts into the hull, leaving it lined with feathers. A voice from heaven, like a heart rived with sorrow, cries, ""O poor bark of mine! How badly art thou freighted!"" Then earth opens, and a dragon issues, fixing its forked train through the chariot, then dragging part of the bottom forth, exulting.
What remains of the car clothes itself with plumes, green as lively turf, which perhaps had been offered with chaste purpose. The wheels and beam are clothed quickly. The holy structure puts forth heads: three on the beam (horned like oxen) and one on each side (with a single horn). Over it sits a ""shameless whore"" (papacy), her ken roving loosely. At her side stands a giant (French monarchy), mingling kisses with her. But her lustful eyes wander to the narrator, and the ""fell minion"" (giant) scourges her from head to foot. Full of jealousy and rage, he unlooses the monster (chariot) and drags it so far across the forest that its shades alone shield the harlot and the new-formed brute.

**CANTO XXXIII**
The trinal and quaternion virgin bands begin their sweet psalmody, weeping, ""The heathen, Lord! are come!"" Beatrice listens, sad and sighing. When they give her place to speak, she rises, glowing bright as fire, and answers, ""Yet a little while, and ye Shall see me not; and, my beloved sisters, Again a little while, and ye shall see me.""
She then marshals the seven nymphs, beckoning the narrator and Statius to follow. She passes on, and before her tenth step, her eyes meet the narrator's. With a mild visage, she cries, ""So mend thy pace... that if my words Address thee, thou mayst still be aptly plac'd To hear them.""
As the narrator hastens to her side, she asks, ""Brother! Why mak'st thou no attempt at questioning, As thus we walk together?"" The narrator, speaking with reverence, answers imperfectly, ""Lady! what I have need of, that thou know'st, And what will suit my need.""
She replies she wills him to rid himself of fearfulness and shame, to speak no more as one who dreams. She tells him, ""Thus far be taught of me: The vessel, which thou saw'st the serpent break, Was and is not: let him, who hath the blame, Hope not to scare God's vengeance with a sop."" She prophesies that the eagle (Empire) will not be without an heir forever, and the foul whore and her accomplice giant will be slain. She plainly views the approaching stars whose conjunction will bring a season when ""one sent from God, (Five hundred, five, and ten, do mark him out)"" will slay them. If her dark saying fails to persuade, ""ere long Events shall be the Naiads, that will solve This knotty riddle."" She tells him to take heed and teach these words to those who live ""that life, which is a race to death."" When he writes, he must not conceal how he has seen the plant (tree of justice) ""that twice hath now been spoil'd."" Whoever robs or plucks it sins against God, who hallowed it for His sole use. For taste of this, the first soul (Adam) yearned in pain and desire for ""five thousand years and upward.""
She states his reason slumbers if it deems the plant's inverted height without due cause. If ""vainer thoughts"" had not dyed his soul dark, he would have seen ""God's equal justice morally implied in the forbidden tree."" But since his understanding is hardened to stone, she wants him to take it painted, if not written, in him.
The narrator replies his brain is stamped by her like wax by a seal. He asks why her speech soars beyond his sight. She answers, ""To the end That thou mayst know... the school, That thou hast follow'd; and how far behind, When following my discourse, its learning halts: And mayst behold your art, from the divine As distant, as the disagreement is 'Twixt earth and heaven's most high and rapturous orb.""
The narrator replies he doesn't remember being estranged from her, nor does conscience chide him. Smiling, she tells him to recall drinking Lethe's wave, and ""in that forgetfulness itself conclude Blame from thy alienated will incurr'd."" She promises her words will be ""as naked as will suit them to appear in thy unpractis'd view.""
The sun, sparkling more, possesses the mid-day circle. The seven-fold band pauses at the verge of a ""dun umbrage hoar,"" like an alpine cliff. Before them, Tigris and Euphrates seem to issue from one fountain, lingering at parting. The narrator asks what water this is. They tell him to entreat Matilda.
Matilda replies she has taught him this and more, and Lethe's water has not hidden it from him. Beatrice says that some pressing care has darkened his mind's eye. She points to Eunoe, telling Matilda to lead him there to revive his fainting virtue. Matilda, like a courteous spirit, takes the narrator and calls to Statius to come with him.
The narrator wishes he could sing of that beverage (Eunoe). But since the leaves for this second strain are full, his art checks him. He returns from the ""most holy wave, regenerate, E'en as new plants renew'd with foliage new, Pure and made apt for mounting to the stars.""

**PARADISE**

**CANTO I**
The glory of God, whose might moves all things, pierces the universe, shedding more resplendence in one part, less elsewhere. The narrator was in heaven, which partakes most largely of this light, witnessing things beyond words to relate. His intellect is so absorbed memory cannot follow, but he will sing of what he stored in thought.
He invokes Apollo for aid, asking to be made a vessel of his worth, as his laurel claims. He says one brow of Parnassus sufficed him so far (for Hell and Purgatory), but now both are needed. He asks Apollo to breathe in his bosom, as when Marsyas was flayed. If Apollo imparts enough power, the narrator will crown himself with laurel at the tree's foot. He notes that if Caesar or bard seldom gather wreaths, joy must spring to Apollo when one breast is inspired with such thirst. From a small spark, great flame has risen; perhaps others will follow with better voice.
The world's bright lamp (sun) rises to mortals through diverse passages, but through the one that joins four circles with the threefold cross (vernal equinox), he comes in his best course and constellation, giving its temper and impression to the worldly wax. Morning is there, and evening here. Whiteness spreads one hemisphere, blackness the other. The narrator sees Beatrice turned to the left, gazing at the sun as never an eagle. As a second beam issues from the first and reflects upward, so his act is formed from hers, and he fixes his eyes on the sun, ""beyond our mortal wont."" Much is allowed there that exceeds their power on earth.
He endures it not long, yet long enough to see it bickering sparks, and suddenly a new day appears, as if another sun bedecked the sky.
Beatrice stands unmoved, eyes fixed on the eternal wheels. The narrator's ken is fixed on her, and at her aspect, he inwardly becomes like Glaucus, who tasted an herb that made him a peer among ocean gods. Words cannot tell this ""transhuman change.""
He addresses Love, the ruler of heaven, saying he was only what Love created anew, and Love knows how by its light he was borne up. As the wheel guided by the ""Desired Spirit"" (God) charms his ear with harmony, so much heaven blazes with the sun's flame, wider than any lake. The newness of sound and great light inflame him with desire to know their cause.
Beatrice, seeing him clearly, opens her lips to calm him before he asks. ""With false imagination thou thyself Mak'st dull, so that thou seest not the thing, Which thou hadst seen, had that been shaken off. Thou art not on the earth as thou believ'st; For light'ning scap'd from its own proper place Ne'er ran, as thou hast hither now return'd.""
Divested of his first doubt, he is entangled in new doubt, asking how he rises above lighter bodies.
With a piteous sigh, Beatrice bends her eyes toward him, like a mother at her frenzied child. She explains: ""Among themselves all things Have order; and from hence the form, which makes The universe resemble God. In this The higher creatures see the printed steps Of that eternal worth, which is the end Whither the line is drawn. All natures lean, In this their order, diversely, some more, Some less approaching to their primal source."" Thus, they are moved to different havens through the ""vast sea of being,"" each with instinct guiding its course: fire to the lunar sphere, mortal animals' hearts prompted, brute earth knit and bound. Not only creatures void of intellect, but intelligent, loving ones are pierced by this bow. Providence, ordering all, makes heaven calm, where the fastest substance is turned. They are carried there, to their predestined seat, by the force of that strong cord that loosens dart only at fair and glad aim.
Yet, just as art's form sometimes ill accords with design due to sluggish matter, so this course is sometimes quit by the creature who has power to bend elsewhere, like fire falling to earth warped by vicious fondness. He should no more admire his soaring than a torrent's lapse downwards from a mountain. There would be more cause for wonder if, free of hindrance, he had fixed himself below, like fire unmoving on earth.
So said, she turns her face toward heaven.

**CANTO II**
The narrator addresses readers in small bark, warning them to return"
The Great Gatsby-F. Scott Fitzgerald,"Nick Carraway, the narrator, recounts his experiences after moving East in the spring of 1922 to work in the bond business. He establishes his habit of reserving judgment, a trait he attributes to his father, but notes an exception for Jay Gatsby, the man for whom he holds ""unaffected scorn"" yet admires for his ""extraordinary gift for hope.""

Nick rents a small house in West Egg, Long Island, situated next to an opulent mansion owned by the mysterious Mr. Gatsby. He soon visits his second cousin, Daisy Buchanan, and her wealthy, arrogant, and physically imposing husband, Tom Buchanan, at their elaborate Georgian Colonial mansion in the more fashionable East Egg. At their home, Nick also meets Jordan Baker, a professional golfer. During dinner, Tom expresses racist views about the ""Nordic race"" and discusses a book he's read. Daisy, displaying a facade of cynical sadness, expresses a wish that her daughter would be a ""beautiful little fool."" A phone call interrupts dinner, revealing Tom's affair to Nick. Miss Baker confirms that Tom ""has some woman in New York."" Nick observes Daisy's underlying unhappiness and Jordan's ""incurable dishonesty,"" having recalled a past scandal involving her moving a golf ball during a tournament. As Nick leaves, Daisy asks about a false rumor of his engagement. That night, Nick sees Gatsby for the first time, standing on his lawn, stretching his arms toward a distant green light across the bay.

Soon after, Tom takes Nick to the ""valley of ashes,"" a desolate industrial wasteland, where they stop at a garage owned by George B. Wilson, a ""spiritless man."" Tom introduces Nick to Wilson's wife, Myrtle, who is also Tom's mistress. Myrtle is a vibrant, sensuous woman in her mid-thirties. Tom arranges to meet her in New York, and she quickly joins them, changing into a more elaborate dress and buying a dog. They go to a small apartment Tom keeps for Myrtle in the city. Guests arrive, including Myrtle's sister, Catherine, and Mr. and Mrs. McKee. Myrtle's personality transforms, becoming haughty and artificial in her new dress. Catherine reveals to Nick a rumor that Gatsby is a relative of Kaiser Wilhelm and that Daisy is Catholic, preventing Tom from divorcing her to marry Myrtle (a detail Nick knows to be false about Daisy). Myrtle recounts her regret over marrying Wilson, whom she thought was a gentleman but who borrowed a suit for their wedding. The party becomes increasingly chaotic as they drink heavily. Late in the evening, during an argument, Myrtle repeatedly shouts Daisy's name, provoking Tom to violently break her nose with his open hand. Nick leaves the chaotic scene with Mr. McKee.

Nick attends one of Gatsby's extravagant, uninvited parties, the first time he's been genuinely invited. He feels out of place among the hundreds of guests, many of whom don't know Gatsby and spread wild rumors about him (e.g., that he killed a man, was a German spy). Nick eventually finds Jordan Baker, and they join a group where more rumors about Gatsby are discussed. In Gatsby's library, they encounter a drunk man with ""owl-eyed"" spectacles, marveling that the books are real. Later, Nick meets Gatsby himself, a young man about thirty, who has a captivating smile and a formal but slightly absurd way of speaking. Gatsby is called away for a phone call. Jordan tells Nick Gatsby claims to be an Oxford man, but she doubts it. Nick observes Gatsby's isolation at his own party. Gatsby's butler later requests Jordan Baker for a private conversation. She emerges an hour later, amazed by what she heard but sworn to secrecy, and cryptically suggests Nick call her. As Nick leaves the party, he witnesses a car crash outside Gatsby's gate, involving the ""owl-eyed man"" and another drunken guest.

One morning, Gatsby picks Nick up in his luxurious yellow car. Gatsby attempts to tell Nick about his past, claiming to be from a wealthy, deceased Middle Western family, educated at Oxford (though he slips and says San Francisco), and a decorated war hero. He shows Nick a medal from Montenegro and an old Oxford photograph as proof. Gatsby then reveals that he has a ""big request"" for Nick, which Jordan Baker will explain. On their drive to the city, Gatsby speeds past a policeman, showing a white card to avoid a ticket, hinting at powerful connections. Gatsby and Nick have lunch with Meyer Wolfshiem, a gambler who reveals his cuff links are made of human molars and who admits to having ""fixed the World's Series back in 1919."" Gatsby abruptly leaves when Tom Buchanan appears at the restaurant, avoiding a direct confrontation.

Later that afternoon, Jordan Baker reveals Gatsby's true motive to Nick: Gatsby bought his mansion specifically to be across the bay from Daisy, near the green light at the end of her dock. He wants Nick to invite Daisy to tea at Nick's house so Gatsby can ""come over"" and for Daisy to see his house. Jordan recounts her past with Daisy: In 1917, Daisy Fay, then eighteen, was in love with a young officer named Jay Gatsby in Louisville. On the night before her wedding to Tom Buchanan, Daisy got drunk, clutching a letter, and wanted to call off the wedding, but was prevented. She married Tom the next day. A week after their honeymoon, Tom crashed his car with another woman in it. Daisy later recognized Gatsby's name when Jordan mentioned it. Nick, now understanding Gatsby's long-held dream, develops feelings for Jordan.

Nick invites Daisy to tea at his house, warning her not to bring Tom. Gatsby, extremely nervous and pale, makes elaborate preparations, sending his gardener to cut Nick's grass and a ""greenhouse"" of flowers. Daisy arrives, and her initial reunion with Gatsby is awkward and strained. After Nick leaves them alone for a while, he returns to find them radiantly happy, Daisy in tears of joy. Gatsby then takes them on a tour of his mansion, during which he briefly contradicts his earlier story of inherited wealth, claiming it took him three years to earn the money, and then vaguely states he was in the ""drug business and then ... the oil business."" Daisy is moved by his collection of expensive shirts and cries into them, saying they're ""such beautiful shirts."" Gatsby points out the green light on Daisy's dock from his window, reflecting that its symbolic significance has vanished now that his dream is realized. He shows Nick a photograph of Dan Cody, his deceased mentor. Gatsby receives a mysterious phone call hinting at illegal business. He has his ""boarder,"" Klipspringer, play the piano. Nick observes that Daisy ""tumbled short of his dreams,"" as Gatsby's illusion had grown ""beyond her, beyond everything."" Gatsby confides in Nick, expressing his desire for Daisy to tell Tom she never loved him, and then they would return to Louisville to marry as if five years had passed. Gatsby believes he ""can repeat the past."" Nick recalls Gatsby's memory of kissing Daisy five years prior, which completed his ""incarnation.""

Gatsby's lavish parties abruptly cease. He dismisses his original servants and hires new ones, connected to Wolfshiem, to prevent gossip because Daisy now visits him frequently. Tom, Nick, Jordan, Daisy, and Gatsby gather for lunch at the Buchanan's, a tense affair on a ""broiling"" hot day. Daisy openly kisses Gatsby in front of Nick and Jordan and tells him she loves him, which Tom notices with astonishment. Daisy's young daughter, Pammy, is brought into the room, and Gatsby looks at her with surprise, as if he never truly believed in her existence. Tom, agitated by Daisy's declaration of love for Gatsby, insists they all go to town. Daisy suggests they take Gatsby's yellow car, but Tom, suspecting Gatsby's intentions, insists on driving Gatsby's car with Jordan and Nick, while Gatsby and Daisy follow in Tom's blue coupé.

On the way to town, Tom confronts Nick and Jordan about Gatsby, revealing he's been investigating him. He accuses Gatsby of being a bootlegger, selling grain alcohol through ""drugstores,"" and being associated with Meyer Wolfshiem. They stop for gas at Wilson's garage in the valley of ashes. George Wilson, looking ill and desperate, tells Tom he needs money because he's ""wised up to something funny"" and wants to take Myrtle and move West. Myrtle, from an upstairs window, watches their car and mistakenly believes Jordan Baker is Tom's wife, consumed by ""jealous terror.""

In a suite at the Plaza Hotel, Tom openly confronts Gatsby, accusing him of being a criminal and a ""swindler."" Gatsby forces Daisy to confess to Tom that she never loved him, but she falters, admitting she ""did love him once—but I loved you too."" Tom, regaining control, further exposes Gatsby's illegal businesses, mentioning a past associate, Walter Chase, whom Gatsby supposedly left to go to jail. Daisy, terrified and overwhelmed, begs to leave. Tom, triumphant, tells Daisy to drive home with Gatsby in Gatsby's car, declaring Gatsby's ""flirtation is over."" Nick, realizing it's his 30th birthday, and Jordan leave with Tom in the coupé.

On the return trip through the valley of ashes, they encounter a chaotic scene: Myrtle Wilson has been struck and killed by a car. Michaelis, a coffee shop owner, witnessed Myrtle run into the road, waving and shouting, and be hit by a ""death car."" A witness confirms it was a ""big yellow car."" Tom is horrified to find Myrtle dead. Wilson, consumed by grief, cries out. Tom quickly deflects suspicion from himself and his blue car by stating the yellow car wasn't his and he had just arrived from New York. Nick later sees Daisy and Tom together in their kitchen, seemingly ""conspiring together,"" a picture of ""natural intimacy,"" despite not having touched their food. Gatsby is waiting outside their house, telling Nick that Daisy was driving his car when she hit Myrtle, and he will take the blame. He waits outside all night to ensure Tom doesn't harm Daisy.

The next morning, Nick goes to Gatsby's house. Gatsby confesses that Daisy turned out the light in her room around four o'clock. He then recounts his true past: he was a penniless young man who fell in love with Daisy, leading him to pretend to be from her social class and possessing wealth to win her. After he went to war, Daisy, pressured by her social world, chose to marry Tom Buchanan for his ""wholesome bulkiness"" and secure position. Gatsby frantically tried to return home but was sent to Oxford instead. He later made a ""miserable but irresistible journey"" to Louisville, revisiting their old haunts, feeling he had lost her forever.

On what becomes his last morning, Gatsby is still hopeful Daisy will call. Nick tells Gatsby that he is ""worth the whole damn bunch put together,"" a compliment Nick later feels glad to have given despite his disapproval of Gatsby. Gatsby puts on his bathing suit and goes to the pool on a pneumatic mattress, instructing his butler to bring any phone calls there. His chauffeur later hears shots. Nick, the chauffeur, butler, and gardener find Gatsby's body floating dead in the pool, shot. Wilson's body is found nearby in the grass.

The narrative shifts to the aftermath of Myrtle's death. Michaelis, who stayed with Wilson, discovers Wilson's growing suspicion about the yellow car and his wife's infidelity, confirmed by an expensive dog leash he found. Wilson, believing the driver of the yellow car murdered Myrtle because she ran out to speak to him, stares at the eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg, declaring ""God sees everything."" Wilson eventually tracks Gatsby to his house and kills him before taking his own life.

In the wake of the ""holocaust,"" Nick feels responsible as Daisy and Tom have vanished, leaving no address. Meyer Wolfshiem refuses to attend the funeral, claiming ""important business"" and a policy against getting ""mixed up"" in deaths. A phone call meant for Gatsby implies his involvement in illegal bond activities. Gatsby's elderly father, Henry C. Gatz, arrives from Minnesota, bringing a picture of Gatsby's house and a childhood book, ""Hopalong Cassidy,"" with Gatsby's youthful ""General Resolves"" and self-improvement schedule written on the flyleaf. Despite Nick's efforts, almost no one attends Gatsby's funeral except Nick, Mr. Gatz, the minister, and the ""owl-eyed man."" Klipspringer calls, not for the funeral, but to retrieve his tennis shoes.

Nick, disillusioned by the East, decides to return West. He breaks off his relationship with Jordan Baker, who accuses him of being dishonest. He encounters Tom Buchanan, who defiantly admits to telling Wilson that Gatsby owned the yellow car, believing Gatsby deserved it and was a ""coward"" for not stopping after hitting Myrtle. Nick concludes that Tom and Daisy are ""careless people"" who ""smashed up things and creatures"" and then retreated into their wealth, leaving others to clean up their mess. Nick visits Gatsby's empty house one last time, reflecting on Gatsby's unwavering dream for Daisy and the ""green light"" that represented his ""orgiastic future."" He concludes that humanity ""beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past."""
The Iliad-Homer,"This detailed summary recounts the plot of ""The Iliad"" as provided in the text.

**Book I: The Contention of Achilles and Agamemnon**
The narrative begins in the tenth year of the siege of Troy, after the Greeks had sacked neighboring towns and taken two beautiful captives: Chryseïs, allotted to Agamemnon, and Briseïs, allotted to Achilles. Chryses, father of Chryseïs and a priest of Apollo, arrives at the Greek camp to ransom his daughter. Agamemnon rudely refuses and dismisses him. Chryses then prays to Apollo for vengeance, and the god inflicts a pestilence upon the Greeks for nine days.

Achilles calls a council, during which the prophet Chalcas reveals that Apollo's rage is due to Agamemnon's refusal to release Chryseïs. Agamemnon is compelled to return his captive but, in a furious contest with Achilles, pacified by Nestor, he seizes Briseïs from Achilles as revenge for his loss. Discontent, Achilles withdraws himself and his Myrmidon forces from the Greek army. He complains to his mother, Thetis, who supplicates Jupiter (Jove) to render the Greeks sensible of the wrong done to her son by granting victory to the Trojans. Jupiter grants her suit, which incenses Juno. A high debate ensues between Jupiter and Juno, which is eventually reconciled by Vulcan. The events of this book span twenty-two days.

**Book II: The Trial of the Army, and Catalogue of the Forces**
To fulfill Thetis's request, Jupiter sends a deceitful vision to Agamemnon, urging him to lead the army to battle with the promise of taking Troy that day, implying the gods have ceased their contention. Agamemnon, deluded but fearing the army is discouraged by Achilles's absence, the recent plague, and the long siege, devises a stratagem. He first tells the princes in council that he will propose a return to Greece to the soldiers, and they should prevent the army from actually leaving.

Agamemnon then assembles the entire host and proposes a return to Greece. The soldiers unanimously agree and rush to prepare their ships. Ulysses, however, intervenes, chastising the insolent Thersites, and detains the fleeing troops. The assembly is recalled, and after several speeches, Nestor's advice is followed: to make a general muster of the troops and divide them into their nations before proceeding to battle. This leads to a long enumeration of the forces of the Greeks and Trojans, detailing their leaders, origins, and numbers. Achilles and his Myrmidons remain withdrawn and inactive by their ships.

**Book III: The Duel of Menelaus and Paris**
The armies, now arrayed, prepare to engage. The Trojans advance with shouts, while the Greeks march in silence, breathing rage. Paris, the cause of the war, steps forward to challenge any Greek to single combat. Menelaus, seeing Paris, is elated with joy and leaps from his chariot to fight. Paris, struck with fear, retreats into the Trojan ranks.

Hector upbraids Paris for his cowardice, calling him a scandal. Paris accepts the rebuke and proposes a single combat with Menelaus to decide the war, with Helen and the treasures she brought as the prize for the victor. Hector agrees and announces the challenge to both armies. Menelaus accepts, demanding two lambs for sacrifice (one sable for Earth, one white for Sun) and a third for Jove, and that King Priam come to swear the solemn oath, as his sons are deemed faithless.

Iris, disguised as Laodice, calls Helen to the walls of Troy, where she finds Helen weaving her story into a golden web. Helen joins Priam and the elders at the Scaean Gate. Priam asks her to identify the Greek leaders, and Helen points out Agamemnon, Ulysses, and Ajax, lamenting her role in the war. She mentions Castor and Pollux, unaware they are dead.

Priam comes to the field, sacrifices are performed, and oaths are sworn by both sides to abide by the duel's outcome. Priam then returns to the city, unable to watch. Lots are cast to decide who throws the first spear; Paris wins. Paris throws his spear, which strikes Menelaus's shield but does not pierce it. Menelaus then throws his spear, which pierces Paris's shield, corslet, and garment, but Paris bends to evade a fatal wound. Menelaus draws his sword, which breaks on Paris's helmet. Menelaus then seizes Paris by the helmet and drags him. Venus intervenes, breaking the helmet strap and whisking Paris away in a cloud to his apartment. Menelaus, enraged, throws the empty helmet to the Greeks and searches for Paris.

Meanwhile, Venus compels a reluctant Helen to join Paris in his apartment. Helen expresses scorn for Paris's cowardice but eventually yields to love. Agamemnon declares Menelaus the victor and demands the return of Helen and the promised fine from Troy.

**Book IV: The Breach of the Truce, and the First Battle**
The gods in council on Olympus debate the war. Jupiter, seeing his partiality, incites Juno by discussing the fate of Paris and Menelaus. Juno, still full of rancor against Troy, is enraged and complains about Jupiter's favoritism. Jupiter allows Minerva to break the truce to ensure Troy's ultimate destruction. Minerva descends, disguised as the Trojan warrior Laodocus, and persuades the Lycian archer Pandarus to shoot Menelaus, promising him rewards.

Pandarus shoots an arrow, which Minerva guides to wound Menelaus without killing him. The arrow pierces his belt and corslet, drawing blood. Agamemnon is distraught, fearing Menelaus's death and the Greeks' despair. Menelaus reassures him the wound is superficial. The physician Machaon is summoned, extracts the arrow, and applies a healing balm.

With the truce broken, the Trojans attack. Agamemnon, despite his brother's wound, rallies the Greek forces, inspiring the brave and reproving the fearful. Nestor is particularly noted for his excellent military discipline. The battle begins fiercely, with many heroes falling on both sides. Antilochus kills Echepolus, Meges kills Pedaeus, and Eurypylus kills Hypsenor. Apollo descends from Troy's walls to animate the Trojans, reminding them that Achilles is not fighting. Diores is killed by Pyrus, who is then killed by Thoas.

**Book V: The Acts of Diomed**
Minerva inspires Diomed, filling him with divine power, making his armor blaze. He performs great deeds, first killing Phegeus and Idæus, sons of Dares (Vulcan saves Idæus). Minerva then tells Mars and Juno to retire from the battle to avoid Jupiter's wrath. Diomed continues his rampage, killing several Trojan and allied leaders, including Odius, Phaestus, Scamandrius, Phereclus, Pedaeus, and Hypsenor.

Pandarus wounds Diomed with an arrow. Diomed prays to Minerva, who heals him and grants him the ability to discern gods from mortals, forbidding him from fighting any god except Venus. Diomed, now greatly empowered, kills Astynous and Hypenor. Aeneas, son of Venus, joins Pandarus in his chariot to confront Diomed. Pandarus expresses frustration that his arrows have failed. Diomed refuses to retreat, planning to capture Aeneas's immortal horses. Pandarus throws his spear, which hits Diomed's shield but does not penetrate. Diomed retaliates, killing Pandarus by spearing him through the face.

Aeneas dismounts to protect Pandarus's body. Diomed hurls a massive stone, crushing Aeneas's hip. Venus, seeing her son in danger, rescues him in a cloud. Diomed, ignoring Minerva's earlier command, pursues and wounds Venus in the hand with his spear. Venus drops Aeneas, who is then rescued by Apollo and taken to his temple in Troy for healing. Diomed insults the fleeing Venus. Venus, wounded, flies to Olympus, where her mother Dione comforts her, recalling other gods wounded by mortals. Juno and Minerva mock Venus, and Jupiter reaffirms that Venus's realm is love, not war.

Apollo then returns Aeneas to the battle, creating a phantom in his likeness to continue the fight. Mars, disguised as Acamas, rallies the Trojans. Sarpedon upbraids Hector for his inaction, prompting Hector to rally his troops. Diomed, Ulysses, and the Ajaces stand firm against the renewed Trojan charge. Menelaus kills Pylaemenes. Hector leads the charge with Mars and Bellona. Diomed, seeing Mars, advises a slow retreat. Hector kills Anchialus and Mnesthes. Ajax kills Amphius. Tlepolemus (son of Hercules) challenges Sarpedon (son of Jove). Sarpedon kills Tlepolemus, though Tlepolemus wounds Sarpedon in the thigh. Ulysses then kills several Lycians. Hector drives the Greeks back, and Sarpedon is carried from the field. Juno and Minerva prepare to fight, but Jove sends Iris to stop them, threatening punishment. They return to Olympus.

**Book VI: The Episodes of Glaucus and Diomed, and of Hector and Andromache**
With the gods withdrawn, the Greeks initially prevail. Ajax kills Acamas. Diomed kills Axylus and his servant Calesius. Euryalus kills Dresus and the sons of Bucolion. Polypoetes kills Astyalus. Ulysses kills Pidytes. Teucer kills Aretaon. Nestor's son kills Ablerus. Agamemnon kills Elatus. Eurypylus kills Melanthius.

Menelaus captures Adrastus, who pleads for ransom. Agamemnon intervenes, telling Menelaus to kill all Trojans. Nestor then urges the Greeks not to stop for spoils but to press the fight. Helenus, the chief augur of Troy, commands Hector to return to the city. He is to instruct Queen Hecuba to lead the Trojan matrons in a solemn procession to Minerva's temple, offering a precious mantle and twelve heifers, to appease the goddess and remove Diomed from battle. Hector complies, rallying his troops and then departing for Troy.

During Hector's absence, Glaucus (a Lycian chief) and Diomed meet between the armies. They discover that their grandfathers, Oeneus and Bellerophon, were guest-friends. They renew this hereditary bond by exchanging armor: Glaucus trades his golden armor for Diomed's bronze, a disadvantageous exchange for Glaucus.

Hector arrives in Troy, where his mother Hecuba offers him wine, which he refuses, stating he is stained with battle. He gives her Helenus's instructions for the offering to Minerva. Hector then visits Paris's house, finding him polishing his arms with Helen and her handmaids. Hector upbraids Paris for his idleness while Troy suffers. Paris admits his fault and agrees to return to battle. Helen laments her destructive beauty and wishes she had died.

Hector then goes to find his wife, Andromache, and their son, Astyanax, at the Scaean Gate. Andromache pleads with Hector to stay within the walls, fearing his death and recounting how Achilles killed her father, mother, and seven brothers. Hector explains his duty to fight and defend Troy, foreseeing its eventual fall and Andromache's enslavement. He embraces Astyanax, who is scared by his helmet, and prays to Jove for his son's future greatness. Hector then returns to battle, joined by Paris.

**Book VII: The Single Combat of Hector and Ajax**
Hector and Paris return to the field, invigorating the Trojans. Paris kills Menestheus. Hector kills Eioneus. Glaucus kills Iphinous. Minerva and Apollo, observing the battle, agree to put an end to the general engagement for the day. Helenus, inspired, tells Hector to challenge a Greek to single combat. Hector issues the challenge, proposing that the winner take the loser's armor, but return the body for proper burial.

The Greeks are hesitant. Menelaus initially steps forward, but Agamemnon and other chiefs restrain him, fearing Hector's strength. Nestor then shames the Greeks for their cowardice, recalling his own youthful valor. Nine Greek chiefs, including Agamemnon, Diomed, and Ulysses, then volunteer. Lots are cast, and Ajax Telamon is chosen.

Ajax and Hector arm themselves and confront each other, exchanging boasts. Hector throws his spear first, which strikes Ajax's sevenfold shield but does not pierce. Ajax then throws his spear, which pierces Hector's shield, corslet, and garment, but Hector evades a fatal blow. They draw their weapons and close for battle. Hector hurls a large stone at Ajax's shield. Ajax retaliates with an even larger stone, striking Hector and causing him to fall. Apollo quickly restores Hector's strength. As they are about to draw swords, two heralds, Talthybius (Greek) and Idæus (Trojan), intervene, declaring that night has fallen and the combat must end.

Hector and Ajax, respecting the heralds, praise each other's valor and exchange gifts as a sign of respect, Hector giving a sword and Ajax a belt. The Trojans joyfully welcome Hector back to the city. The Greeks lead Ajax to Agamemnon's tent, where he is honored with a feast.

In a Greek council, Nestor advises burning their dead and then building a strong fortification (wall, ditch, palisades) to protect their ships and camp. Meanwhile, in Troy, the Trojans hold a council. Antenor proposes returning Helen and her treasures. Paris offers to return the treasures but insists on keeping Helen. Priam proposes a compromise: offering the treasures and requesting a truce to bury the dead. Idæus presents this offer to the Greeks. Diomed strongly rejects the treasures and Helen, confident that Troy will fall. Agamemnon accepts only the truce for burial.

Both armies then spend the day collecting and burning their dead. The Greeks build their defensive wall. Neptune is angered that the Greeks built the wall without offerings to the gods and complains to Jupiter. Jupiter placates Neptune, promising that the wall will eventually be destroyed. Both armies feast through the night, but Jupiter sends thunder and other signs of wrath to the Trojans.

**Book VIII: The Second Battle, and the Distress of the Greeks**
At dawn, Jupiter convenes a council of the gods, strictly forbidding any deity from assisting either side, under threat of severe punishment in Tartarus. Minerva alone is permitted to offer counsel to the Greeks. Jupiter then mounts his chariot and flies to Mount Ida to oversee the battle.

The battle begins, evenly matched at first. At noon, Jupiter weighs the fates of Greece and Troy in his golden scales; the Greek scale sinks, signifying their impending defeat. Jupiter unleashes thunder and lightning, terrifying the Greeks. The Greeks begin to retreat. Nestor's horse is wounded by Paris. Diomed rescues Nestor, whose chariot is imperiled by Hector, while Ulysses flees. Diomed throws his spear at Hector, missing him but killing his charioteer, Eniopeus. Hector replaces him with Archeptolemus. Jupiter sends another lightning bolt, causing Diomed's horses to recoil. Nestor advises Diomed to retreat, acknowledging Jove's favor for Hector. Diomed reluctantly obeys, and Hector pursues, boasting of his imminent victory and the capture of Achilles's armor.

Juno complains to Neptune about the Greek distress, but Neptune refuses to intervene directly against Jupiter's will. Hector and the Trojans relentlessly drive the Greeks back towards their fortifications. Agamemnon, distraught, prays to Jupiter for salvation. Jupiter sends a favorable omen – an eagle dropping a fawn near his altar – reinvigorating the Greeks. Diomed leads a renewed charge, followed by other Greek heroes. Teucer, protected by Ajax's shield, kills many Trojans with arrows. Agamemnon praises Teucer and promises him rich gifts. Teucer attempts to shoot Hector, but Jove (or Apollo) deflects the arrow. Teucer shoots again, killing Priam's son Gorgythio. His third attempt at Hector is foiled when Apollo breaks his bowstring. Ajax covers Teucer, and he is carried off the field.

The Trojans, again favored by Jove, press the Greeks back to their wall. Juno and Minerva prepare to intervene, but Jupiter sends Iris to stop them, threatening to cast them into Tartarus. They return to Olympus, abashed. Jupiter returns to Olympus, rebukes the goddesses, and prophesies that Hector will continue to drive the Greeks until Achilles rises after Patroclus's death, at which point Hector will die and Troy will fall. As night falls, the Trojans, at Hector's command, light numerous fires across the plain and remain encamped, intending to prevent the Greeks from escaping by sea.

**Book IX: The Embassy to Achilles**
The Greeks spend the night in despair, tormented by fear and the sight of the Trojan campfires. Agamemnon, weeping, calls a council of the elders and proposes abandoning the siege and returning to Greece. Diomed fiercely opposes this, calling Agamemnon a coward and declaring he will stay and fight even if alone. Nestor praises Diomed's spirit, then advises Agamemnon to strengthen the night guards and hold a more formal council. He then suggests sending an embassy to Achilles to reconcile him.

Agamemnon agrees, acknowledging his fault. He offers Achilles immense gifts: ten talents of gold, twenty shining vases, seven unused tripods, twelve victorious horses, seven beautiful Lesbian captive women (including Briseïs, whom he swears he never touched), and twenty Trojan women after Troy's fall. He also offers one of his three daughters in marriage with seven rich cities as dowry. Nestor selects Phoenix (Achilles's old tutor), great Ajax, and wise Ulysses as ambassadors, accompanied by heralds.

The embassy finds Achilles in his tent, playing a harp with Patroclus. Achilles welcomes them warmly. Ulysses presents Agamemnon's offer, detailing the desperate situation of the Greeks and recalling Achilles's father Peleus's advice to curb his temper. Achilles vehemently rejects all offers, stating his firm resolve to remain withdrawn. He recounts Agamemnon's past injustice and declares that he values life more than glory or wealth. He announces his intention to return home to Phthia on the third day and advises the Greeks to do the same.

Phoenix, weeping, recounts his own past as Achilles's tutor and foster father, urging him to relent, using the story of Meleager (who refused to fight until his city was burning) as a cautionary tale. Achilles remains unmoved, stating Jove honors him and he will not plead for Agamemnon. Ajax then reproaches Achilles, highlighting the harshness of his refusal given the immense suffering and the value of his friendship. Achilles softens slightly, stating he will not join the battle until Hector reaches and sets fire to his own ships.

The ambassadors return to Agamemnon, and Ulysses reports Achilles's unwavering refusal. Diomed again urges the Greeks to prepare for battle at dawn, without relying on Achilles. The Greeks, though dismayed, agree and prepare for sleep.

**Book X: The Night-Adventure of Diomed and Ulysses**
Agamemnon, unable to sleep due to anxiety, rises and goes to consult with Nestor. He finds Menelaus also awake and anxious. Agamemnon instructs Menelaus to wake Ajax and Idomeneus, while he goes to Nestor. Nestor, also awake and armed, joins Agamemnon. They gather Ulysses, Diomed, Meges, and Merion for a council.

Nestor proposes sending a spy into the Trojan camp to gather intelligence. Diomed volunteers and chooses Ulysses as his companion, praising his wisdom and Minerva's protection. Ulysses agrees. They arm themselves: Diomed with a lion's hide and a simple helmet, Ulysses with a sword, bow, quiver, and a boar's-tusk helmet (gifted from Merion). Minerva sends a heron as a favorable omen. They pray to Pallas for success.

Meanwhile, Hector offers a rich reward (Achilles's chariot and immortal steeds) to any Trojan who will spy on the Greek camp. Dolon, a swift but not handsome youth, accepts. He sets out wearing a wolf's hide. Diomed and Ulysses ambush and capture him. Dolon, begging for his life, reveals the positions of the Trojan and auxiliary forces, mentioning Rhesus and the Thracians, their white horses, and golden armor. Diomed then kills Dolon, stating a traitor should not live to betray again, and they take his spoils, dedicating them to Pallas.

Diomed and Ulysses proceed to the Thracian camp, where they find Rhesus and his men asleep. Diomed, guided by Pallas, kills Rhesus and twelve Thracian warriors. Ulysses unties Rhesus's famed white horses. Pallas warns them to leave. They return with the horses. Nestor recognizes their approach. They recount their successful mission. They wash themselves in the sea, refresh, and make libations to Pallas.

**Book XI: The Third Battle, and the Acts of Agamemnon**
At dawn, Jove sends Eris (Discord) to the Greek fleet, rousing them to battle. Agamemnon arms himself in splendid, divinely-crafted armor, leading the Greeks. Jove marks the day with drops of blood from the sky. The Trojans array themselves under Hector, Polydamas, Aeneas, and other chiefs.

Agamemnon leads a fierce assault, slaying Bienor and his squire, then Priam's sons Isus and Antiphus. He continues his rampage, killing the sons of Antimachus despite their pleas for ransom. Agamemnon drives the Trojans back to the city walls. Jupiter, however, sends Iris to Hector, commanding him to avoid direct combat while Agamemnon rages. Iris tells Hector to hold his forces until Agamemnon is wounded and withdraws, at which point Jove will empower Hector to drive the Greeks to their ships until sunset.

Hector obeys, withdrawing from the front. Iphidamas attacks Agamemnon, who disarms and kills him. Coon, Iphidamas's brother, wounds Agamemnon in the arm but is then killed by Agamemnon. The pain from his wound eventually forces Agamemnon to retreat to his chariot.

Seeing Agamemnon retire, Hector rallies the Trojans and leads a fresh charge, killing numerous Greek heroes. Ulysses and Diomed rally to stem the tide. Diomed kills Thymbraeus and Molion. Both Diomed and Ulysses continue to slay Trojans. Hector attacks Diomed, but Apollo deflects Diomed's spear. Paris then wounds Diomed in the foot with an arrow. Diomed insults Paris and, with Ulysses's help to extract the arrow, withdraws to the ships. Ulysses is then left alone and besieged by Trojans, but he fights bravely, killing many. Menelaus and Ajax rescue the wounded Ulysses.

Meanwhile, Hector continues his rampage on the left wing. Paris wounds Machaon, the physician, with an arrow. Idomeneus tells Nestor to convey Machaon to the ships for healing. As Nestor departs, Cebriones advises Hector to attack where Ajax is fighting. Hector, with Jove's aid, breaks the Greek phalanx, causing Ajax to slowly retreat. Eurypylus aids Ajax but is wounded in the thigh by Paris. Patroclus, seeing the desperate situation from Achilles's tent, is moved by compassion. He leaves Eurypylus to go to Nestor and asks which Greek was wounded. Nestor recounts the many wounded chiefs, Achilles's inaction, and past wars. He suggests that Patroclus wear Achilles's armor to scare the Trojans and save the fleet, but warns him not to pursue the Trojans to Troy itself. Patroclus, on his way back, meets the wounded Eurypylus and assists him.

**Book XII: The Battle at the Grecian Wall**
While Patroclus attends to Eurypylus, the battle rages at the Greek fortifications. The narrator foretells the future destruction of these walls by Neptune and Apollo after Troy's fall. Hector and the Trojans, emboldened by Jove, approach the Greek trench. Their chariots are unable to cross the trench due to sharpened stakes. Polydamas wisely advises Hector to abandon the chariots and attack on foot, dividing the army into five battalions. Hector agrees.

As the Trojans prepare, an omen appears: an eagle carrying a serpent, which stings the eagle and is dropped in the midst of the Trojan host. Polydamas interprets this as a warning from Jove that they will take the wall but not hold the prize, suffering great losses. Hector furiously rejects this advice, declaring that he trusts Jove's past favor and needs no omens. He threatens Polydamas for suggesting retreat.

Hector leads the charge, and the Trojans assault the wall. Polypoetes and Leonteus defend one gate fiercely. Sarpedon, son of Jove, with Glaucus and Asteropaeus, leads the Lycian division and makes a powerful assault. Sarpedon inspires Glaucus with a speech about the glory of fighting for their country. Menestheus, seeing the danger, sends Thoas to call for Ajax and Teucer. Ajax kills Epicles with a huge stone. Teucer wounds Glaucus with an arrow, forcing him to withdraw. Sarpedon kills Alcmaon and then tears down a battlement, creating a breach. Hector, aided by Jove, then heaves a massive stone, smashing it through the main gate. He rushes through, appearing like a god, and the Trojans pour in after him. The Greeks tremble and flee to their ships.

**Book XIII: The Fourth Battle Continued, in which Neptune Assists the Greeks**
Jupiter, having seen Hector successfully breach the Greek fortifications, turns his attention away from the battle, allowing fate to take its course. Neptune, observing the Greek distress, takes the form of Calchas and inspires the Ajaces (Ajax Telamon and Ajax Oileus) to stand firm against Hector. He touches them, filling them with divine strength. Neptune then encourages other Greek chiefs who had retreated to their ships.

The Greeks rally, forming a dense phalanx. Hector leads the Trojan assault against them. Deiphobus throws a spear at Merion, but it only breaks on his shield, and Merion retrieves another spear from his tent. Teucer kills Imbrius. Hector throws a spear at Teucer, missing him but killing Amphimachus (Neptune's grandson). Ajax takes Amphimachus's armor, and Ajax Oileus lops off Imbrius's head and throws it towards Hector.

Neptune, enraged by his grandson Amphimachus's death, inspires Idomeneus. Idomeneus, though wounded, returns to battle with Merion. Idomeneus kills Othryoneus, who had sought Cassandra's hand. He then kills Asius, whose charioteer is killed by Antilochus. Deiphobus throws a spear at Idomeneus, missing him but killing Hypsenor. Idomeneus then kills Alcathous, Aeneas's brother-in-law, with Neptune's aid. Deiphobus, enraged, seeks Aeneas, who had been holding back due to resentment towards Priam, and persuades him to join the fight against Idomeneus. Aeneas gathers his forces. Idomeneus and Aeneas clash, and Idomeneus kills Oenomaus. Deiphobus kills Ascalaphus, the son of Mars. Merion wounds Deiphobus in the arm. Aeneas kills Aphareus, and Antilochus kills Thoon. Merion kills Adamas. Helenus wounds Deipyrus. Menelaus wounds Helenus in the hand and then kills Pisander. Paris kills Euchenor with an arrow.

The Greeks gain the upper hand on the left wing, pushed by Neptune's influence. However, Hector still holds the center. The Locrian archers and slingers, fighting behind the main Greek lines, rain down projectiles on the Trojans. Polydamas, seeing the Trojan losses, again advises Hector to call a council to decide whether to continue fighting at the ships or retreat to the city, fearing Achilles's return. Hector agrees and goes to rally his forces on the left, upbraiding Paris for his absence. Paris defends himself, and they rejoin the main battle. Hector returns to the central conflict, defying Ajax. Ajax defies him back, and Jupiter sends an eagle as an omen for the Greeks. Both sides shout, ready for battle.

**Book XIV: Juno Deceives Jupiter by the Girdle of Venus**
Nestor, hearing the renewed clamor of battle, leaves the wounded Machaon and goes to find Agamemnon. He encounters Agamemnon, Diomed, and Ulysses, all wounded and supporting themselves on their spears. Nestor informs them that the wall is breached and the Greeks are fleeing. Agamemnon, desperate, proposes abandoning the siege and fleeing by ship at night. Ulysses vehemently condemns this idea, calling it cowardly and ruinous. Diomed advises that even though wounded, the leaders should return to the front lines to inspire the troops, but remain out of direct combat. The wounded kings agree and proceed to the battle. Neptune, disguised as an old man, meets Agamemnon, inspires him, and then shouts to rally the entire Greek army.

Meanwhile, Juno observes Jupiter on Mount Ida, aiding the Trojans. She devises a plan to deceive him. She adorns herself with great care, using ambrosial oil and beautiful garments. She then goes to Venus and asks for her magic girdle, the cestus, which contains charms of love and desire. Venus grants it. Juno then flies to Lemnos to find Sleep, asking him to put Jupiter to sleep. Sleep is reluctant, recalling a previous occasion when Jupiter nearly hurled him into Tartarus for putting him to sleep, allowing Hercules to be shipwrecked. Juno promises Sleep Pasithaë, the youngest of the Graces, in marriage, and swears an oath by the river Styx. Sleep agrees and flies with Juno to Mount Ida, hiding in a fir tree.

Juno approaches Jupiter, who is instantly overcome with desire for her. She pretends to be on her way to reconcile Ocean and Tethys. Jupiter, smitten, insists they make love on Ida. Juno initially feigns modesty but eventually agrees. Jupiter covers them with a golden cloud, and they make love, after which Jupiter falls into a deep sleep.

Sleep immediately goes to Neptune and tells him that Jupiter is asleep, urging him to aid the Greeks. Neptune, invigorated, rallies the Greek forces, urging them to put on their strongest armor and follow him. The wounded kings exchange their lighter armor for heavier shields and spears. Neptune leads the Greeks. Hector throws his spear at Ajax, but it is deflected. Ajax then hurls a massive stone at Hector, striking him in the breast and throat, and knocking him to the ground. The Trojans despair, thinking Hector is dead. Polydamas, Aeneas, and other chiefs protect Hector's body, carrying him from the field towards Troy, where he slowly revives near the Xanthus river. Seeing Hector retreat, the Greeks press their advantage, and many Trojans are killed by Ajax Oileus, Polydamas, Ajax Telamon, Acamas, and Peneleus.

**Book XV: The Fifth Battle at the Ships; and the Acts of Ajax**
The fleeing Trojans regroup by their chariots. Jupiter awakens on Mount Ida, sees the Greek success, Hector wounded, and Neptune leading the Greeks. He furiously reproaches Juno for her deception and reminds her of past punishments. Juno denies any involvement, swearing by Styx that Neptune acted independently. Jupiter, accepting her denial, reveals his ultimate plan: Iris will command Neptune to withdraw, Apollo will heal and re-inspire Hector, who will drive the Greeks to Achilles's fleet. Patroclus will then join the battle, kill Sarpedon, but then be killed by Hector. Finally, Achilles will rise in vengeance, and Troy will fall.

Juno flies to Olympus and expresses her anger about Jove's tyranny to the other gods. Mars, hearing that his son Ascalaphus was killed, prepares to fight Jupiter, but Minerva restrains him. Juno then sends Iris and Apollo to Jupiter on Ida. Jupiter commands Iris to tell Neptune to leave the battle and Apollo to heal Hector and lead him back to battle with the aegis. Iris delivers the message to Neptune. Neptune, though defiant of Jupiter's authority, reluctantly agrees to withdraw to avoid Jove's ultimate wrath, but warns that his anger will persist if Troy is not destroyed. He plunges into the sea.

Apollo descends to Hector, who is still recovering near the Xanthus. Apollo re-inspires him with vigor and confidence, assuring him of Jove's support. Hector, reanimated, returns to the battle. Thoas, a Greek chief, recognizes Hector's renewed divine strength and advises the Greeks to form a strong defensive line at the ships. Apollo, carrying Jove's aegis, leads Hector and the Trojans, shaking the aegis to terrify the Greeks. The Greeks panic and flee, pursued by Hector and the Trojans. Hector kills Arcesilas, Stichius, Medon, Iasus, Mecystes, Clonius, Deiochus, and Echius.

Apollo then pushes down a large section of the Greek wall, creating an open path to the ships. The Trojans pour through the breach. Nestor prays to Jove, and Jove sends thunder, which the Trojans interpret as a sign of success. The Trojans begin setting fire to the Greek ships. Patroclus, seeing the flames from Eurypylus's tent, rushes to urge Achilles to fight. Hector cuts the head off Ajax's spear. Ajax, seeing Jove's will, retreats. Hector finally sets fire to one of the Greek ships, the one that brought Protesilaus to Troy. He exhorts his troops to bring more flames. Ajax, fighting fiercely on the ship's deck, defends it, killing twelve Trojans who attempt to set it on fire.

**Book XVI: The Sixth Battle, the Acts and Death of Patroclus**
Patroclus, weeping, approaches Achilles in his tent. He describes the dire state of the Greeks and begs Achilles to either fight himself or allow Patroclus to lead the Myrmidons in Achilles's armor. Achilles, moved by the sight of the burning ships, agrees to let Patroclus use his armor to repel the Trojans from the fleet. He gives Patroclus strict instructions: only to save the ships, not to pursue the Trojans to Troy or engage Hector. Achilles, in a moment of extreme emotion, wishes that all Trojans and Greeks would perish, leaving only himself and Patroclus to conquer Troy.

As Hector sets fire to the first ship, Achilles tells Patroclus to arm immediately. Patroclus dons Achilles's famous armor, except for the Pelian ash spear, which only Achilles can wield. Automedon harnesses Achilles's immortal horses, Xanthus and Balius, with the mortal Pedasus. Achilles rallies his Myrmidons and offers a libation to Jove, praying for Patroclus's success and safe return. Jove grants the first part but denies the second.

Patroclus leads the Myrmidons into battle. The Trojans, mistaking him for Achilles, are seized with panic and flee from the ships. Patroclus extinguishes the fires and drives the Trojans back. He kills Pyrechmes and other Trojan leaders, allowing the Greeks to re-take their decks. Patroclus continues to slaughter Trojans, including Areilycus, Thoas, Amphidus, Cleobulus, Lycon, Neamas, and Erymas.

Sarpedon, son of Jove, rallies his Lycians and confronts Patroclus. Jove debates saving his son but is persuaded by Juno to let fate take its course. Jove sheds drops of blood as a lament for Sarpedon. Patroclus kills Thrasymed. Sarpedon then kills Pedasus, Achilles's mortal horse. Finally, Patroclus kills Sarpedon with a spear to the heart. Sarpedon, dying, urges Glaucus to defend his body and armor. Glaucus, wounded, prays to Apollo for strength, and Apollo heals him. Glaucus then rallies the Trojans and allies to fight for Sarpedon's body. Patroclus rallies the Greeks. A fierce battle rages over Sarpedon's body, covered by Jove with darkness. Hector kills Epigeus. Patroclus kills Sthenelaus. Glaucus kills Bathyclaeus. Merion kills Laogonus.

Jove casts fear into Hector, who retreats, leaving Sarpedon's body and armor to the Greeks. Patroclus takes Sarpedon's radiant armor as spoils. Apollo, at Jove's command, removes Sarpedon's body, bathes it, anoints it, and sends Sleep and Death to carry it to Lycia for burial.

Patroclus, disregarding Achilles's orders, pursues the fleeing Trojans all the way to the walls of Troy. He attacks the walls three times, but Apollo repulses him each time, warning him to cease. Apollo, disguised as Asius, urges Hector to fight Patroclus. Hector charges. Patroclus kills Cebriones, Hector's charioteer, with a stone. Hector and Patroclus fight over Cebriones's body. Jove then determines Patroclus's death. Apollo strikes Patroclus from behind, disarming him. Euphorbus wounds Patroclus with a spear. Finally, Hector kills Patroclus with his lance. As he dies, Patroclus prophesies Hector's own imminent death by Achilles. Hector boasts over the fallen hero. Automedon, Achilles's charioteer, flees with the immortal horses.

**Book XVII: The Seventh Battle, for the Body of Patroclus.—The Acts of Menelaus**
Patroclus's body lies on the battlefield. Menelaus immediately springs forward to defend it. Euphorbus, who had inflicted the first wound on Patroclus, confronts Menelaus and claims the spoils. Menelaus kills Euphorbus. Apollo, disguised as Mentes, then urges Hector to fight for Patroclus's body and the armor (Achilles's armor) now worn by Menelaus. Hector charges. Menelaus, seeing Hector, retreats, calling for Ajax.

Menelaus and Ajax return to the fray. Hector retreats, carrying Achilles's armor from Patroclus's body towards Troy as a prize. Glaucus then publicly upbraids Hector for his retreat and for abandoning Sarpedon's body, urging him to return and seize Patroclus's corpse as a worthy exchange. Hector, stung by the rebuke, dons Achilles's armor (which he had stripped from Patroclus). Jupiter sees Hector in the divine armor and grants him temporary glory, but foresees his impending death. Hector rallies the Trojans and allies, promising great rewards for capturing Patroclus's body. Ajax rallies the Greeks in response, joined by Ajax Oileus, Idomeneus, and Merion.

A fierce, prolonged battle ensues around Patroclus's body. Jupiter covers the body in a thick darkness while the surrounding battle rages. Hippothous attempts to drag the body away but is killed by Ajax. Hector throws a javelin at Ajax, missing him but killing Schedius. Ajax then kills Phorcys. Apollo, disguised as Periphas, encourages Aeneas to rally the Trojans and attack the Greeks. Aeneas charges, killing Leocritus and Apisaon. The Greeks form a bronze bulwark around the body.

The battle continues, fluctuating back and forth. Jupiter ensures darkness around Patroclus's body while the rest of the field is illuminated. Achilles's immortal horses, Xanthus and Balius, weep for Patroclus's death. Automedon, their charioteer, tries to control them but they are inconsolable. Jupiter pities them and instills new spirit, ensuring they carry Automedon safely. Alcimedon takes the reins, and Automedon fights on foot. Hector and Aeneas attack Automedon's chariot. Automedon kills Aretus. Ajax and Menelaus come to his aid. Minerva, disguised as Phoenix, inspires Menelaus, who kills Podes. Apollo, disguised as Phaenops, encourages Hector. Jupiter shakes his aegis, terrifying the Greeks. Peneleus is wounded by Polydamas, and Leitus by Hector. Idomeneus throws a spear at Hector, misses, but kills Merion's charioteer, Coeranus. Idomeneus and Merion retreat.

Ajax, recognizing Jove's will, prays for the darkness to be lifted so they can see to fight or die. Jove grants his prayer, restoring light. Menelaus sends Antilochus to Achilles with the news of Patroclus's death. Antilochus departs, distraught. Menelaus returns to the battle, and with Merion and the two Ajaces, they finally succeed in lifting Patroclus's body and begin bearing it back to the ships, pursued by the enraged Trojans led by Hector and Aeneas. The battle continues to rage as they retreat.

**Book XVIII: The Grief of Achilles, and New Armour Made Him by Vulcan**
The battle rages, but by the ships, Antilochus reaches Achilles. Achilles, having had a dark premonition, is already deeply troubled. Antilochus delivers the dreadful news: Patroclus is dead, and Hector has stripped him of Achilles's armor. Achilles is overcome with profound grief, falling to the ground, covering himself with dust, tearing his hair, and roaring in anguish. His captive women join in lamentation. Thetis, his mother, and the Nereids (sea-nymphs) hear his cries from the deep and come to comfort him.

Achilles expresses his overwhelming desire for revenge against Hector, even if it means his own death, which Thetis prophesies will follow Hector's. Achilles accepts his fate, vowing to kill Hector and sacrifice twelve Trojan captives at Patroclus's pyre. Thetis promises to bring him new, divinely forged armor from Vulcan by dawn. She departs for Olympus, while Achilles's grief continues.

Meanwhile, the Greeks are still struggling to recover Patroclus's body from the relentless Trojan assault. Juno sends Iris to Achilles, urging him to show himself, even unarmed, to scare the Trojans away. Achilles, though unarmed, rises. Pallas (Minerva) casts a golden cloud and a radiant flame around his head. Achilles stands at the trench and shouts three times. His terrifying voice and the divine light cause the Trojans to panic, their chariots to crash, and twelve warriors to be crushed. The Greeks seize Patroclus's body and carry it back to Achilles's tent.

As night falls, the Trojans hold a council. Polydamas wisely advises retreating to the city walls, fearing Achilles's impending wrath. Hector defiantly rejects this, insisting they remain encamped on the plain to attack the Greek ships at dawn, confident in Jove's favor. Pallas blinds the Trojans' minds, causing them to applaud Hector's reckless counsel.

The Greeks mourn Patroclus all night. Achilles continues his intense lamentation, promising the sacrifices of Hector and twelve Trojans. He orders his men to wash and prepare Patroclus's body, which they do, laying it on a bed of state.

Thetis arrives at Vulcan's palace on Olympus. Vulcan's wife, Charis, greets her. Vulcan, indebted to Thetis for saving him in the past, asks her what she needs. Thetis recounts Achilles's sorrows and requests new armor. Vulcan readily agrees and immediately begins forging magnificent armor. He crafts a massive, intricately detailed shield, depicting the cosmos, two cities (one at peace, one at war), agricultural scenes, a vineyard, a herd of cattle, and a dancing circle. He also forges a splendid cuirass, greaves, and a helmet. Thetis then takes the blazing new armor and flies swiftly to Achilles.

**Book XIX: The Reconciliation of Achilles and Agamemnon**
At dawn, Thetis brings the magnificent, divinely crafted armor to Achilles, finding him still mourning Patroclus. Achilles marvels at the armor. He expresses concern that Patroclus's body will decay, but Thetis reassures him that she will preserve it with nectar and ambrosia. She instructs him to renounce his wrath and lead the Greeks to battle.

Achilles calls an assembly of the Greeks. Many warriors attend, including the wounded Diomed, Ulysses, and Agamemnon. Achilles publicly declares his anger ended, blaming Jove, Fate, and the goddess Ate for their past quarrel. Agamemnon publicly accepts the blame, recounting the story of Ate deceiving Jupiter regarding Hercules, as a parallel for his own delusion. He then promises all the gifts previously offered, including Briseïs (swearing a solemn oath that he never touched her), and more.

Achilles, impatient for battle, wants to fight immediately. Ulysses, however, advises that the army must first eat and rest to regain strength. He also insists that Agamemnon perform the oath and present the gifts publicly. Agamemnon agrees to all of Ulysses's conditions. Achilles, still consumed by grief and desire for vengeance, refuses to eat, vowing to fight until his rage is sated with blood. Jupiter, seeing his refusal, sends Minerva to secretly infuse nectar and ambrosia into Achilles, sustaining him.

Achilles then arms himself in his new, blazing armor, which reflects light like a star. He mounts his chariot, addressing his immortal horses, Xanthus and Balius, reproaching them for Patroclus's death. Xanthus miraculously speaks, prophesying Achilles's own death, not by their fault, but by divine and mortal hands. The Furies then silence Xanthus. Undeterred, Achilles proclaims he knows his fate and rushes into battle.

**Book XX: The Battle of the Gods, and the Acts of Achilles**
As Achilles prepares for battle, Jupiter calls a council of the gods. He permits them to assist either side, fearing that Achilles fighting alone would quickly destroy Troy against fate. The gods descend and engage in battle, causing immense chaos, earthquakes, and thunder. Neptune and Pallas fight for the Greeks, while Apollo, Mars, Latona, Diana, and Xanthus (the river Scamander) fight for the Trojans. Hades trembles in the underworld, fearing his realm will be exposed by the tumult above.

Achilles, filled with rage, seeks Hector. Apollo, disguised as Lycaon, encourages Aeneas to confront Achilles. Aeneas is initially hesitant, recalling a previous defeat, but Apollo reminds him of his divine lineage and promises aid. Aeneas charges Achilles. Juno, seeing Aeneas's danger, expresses concern. Neptune, intervening, surrounds Achilles in darkness, removes his spear from Aeneas's shield, lifts Aeneas, and transports him to the rear of the battle, warning him not to fight Achilles until Achilles's fated time comes.

Neptune removes the mist from Achilles's eyes. Achilles is amazed, realizing a god intervened. He then exhorts the Greeks to fight fiercely and charges into the Trojan ranks. Hector rallies the Trojans, though Apollo warns him to avoid direct combat with Achilles. Achilles begins a terrible slaughter, killing Iphytion, Demoleon, Hippodamas, and Polydore (Priam's youngest son). Hector, enraged by Polydore's death, confronts Achilles. They exchange fierce words. Hector throws his spear, which Pallas deflects from Achilles. Achilles charges, but Apollo shrouds Hector in a cloud, saving him. Achilles, frustrated, rages at Apollo and continues his slaughter of other Trojans, filling the river Scamander with bodies and blood.

**Book XXI: The Battle in the River Scamander**
The Trojans flee from Achilles, some towards the city, others plunging into the river Scamander. Achilles discards his spear and attacks those in the river with his sword, capturing twelve youths alive for sacrifice to Patroclus. He then encounters Lycaon, a son of Priam whom he had previously captured and sold into slavery. Lycaon, begging for mercy and ransom, reminds Achilles of their past. Achilles, hardened by Patroclus's death, refuses all pity and kills Lycaon, casting his body into the river.

Achilles then confronts Asteropeus, a Paeonian chief and grandson of the river Axius. Asteropeus wounds Achilles's hand with a spear, but Achilles kills him with his sword, boasting of his divine lineage. He continues to kill more Paeonians. The river Scamander, choked with bodies and blood, speaks to Achilles, begging him to cease. Achilles refuses, vowing to continue until Troy falls or Hector is dead.

The river, enraged, swells and attacks Achilles with huge waves, throwing bodies and trees at him. Achilles is nearly overwhelmed. He prays to Jove, and Neptune and Pallas appear in human form, reassuring him that he will not perish by the river and will eventually kill Hector. Reinvigorated, Achilles continues his assault. Scamander calls upon his brother river Simois for aid. Juno then orders Vulcan to attack the rivers with fire. Vulcan unleashes an immense blaze, drying up the river, burning the banks, boiling the water, and killing the fish. Scamander, scorched, pleads with Juno to stop, promising to cease aiding Troy. Juno orders Vulcan to extinguish the flames.

With the river battle ended, the other gods engage in combat. Mars attacks Minerva, who strikes him down with a massive stone. Venus helps Mars to rise, but Minerva strikes Venus as well, knocking them both down. Neptune challenges Apollo, but Apollo refuses to fight over mere mortals. Diana (Artemis) upbraids Apollo for this, leading Juno to seize Diana, breaking her bow and scattering her arrows. Latona collects Diana's weapons. Hermes declines to fight Latona. The gods return to Olympus. Apollo then enters Troy to protect its walls. Achilles continues his slaughter, driving the remaining Trojans towards the city. Priam orders the city gates to be opened for the fleeing Trojans but closed quickly. Apollo saves Agenor by shrouding him in a cloud and then, disguised as Agenor, leads Achilles away from the city in a long chase, allowing the rest of the Trojans to escape into Troy.

**Book XXII: The Death of Hector**
The Trojans, safe within the walls, recover from their panic. Hector, however, remains outside the Scaean Gate, resolved to face Achilles alone. Apollo, revealing his true form, chides Achilles for pursuing a god while the Trojans escaped. Achilles, enraged, turns towards the city.

Priam, from the city walls, sees Achilles approaching and desperately pleads with Hector to come inside, lamenting the many sons Achilles has already killed and fearing Hector's fate. Hecuba joins her husband, baring her breast and begging Hector to remember her motherly care and seek safety. Hector, however, stands firm. He feels shame for having ignored Polydamas's earlier advice to retreat and for the resulting losses. He debates with himself, considering surrendering or negotiating, but dismisses these thoughts as cowardly. He resolves to fight for Troy, even if it means death.

Achilles approaches, his new armor blazing like a star. Hector's resolve breaks, and he flees in terror. Achilles pursues him. They run three times around the walls of Troy. The gods watch, and Jupiter pities Hector, considering saving him. Minerva intervenes, reminding Jove that Hector is fated to die. Jupiter weighs their fates; Hector's scale sinks. Apollo, who had been protecting Hector, abandons him.

Minerva appears to Achilles, telling him victory is at hand. She then disguises herself as Deiphobus, Hector's brother, and approaches Hector, urging him to stand and fight Achilles together. Hector is relieved, believing he has an ally. He proposes an oath to Achilles to respect the body of the fallen. Achilles furiously rejects any oaths, declaring eternal hatred and stating that Pallas has delivered Hector to him.

Achilles throws his spear, but Hector ducks, and it flies harmlessly past. Minerva retrieves the spear and returns it to Achilles, unseen by Hector. Hector, unaware he is now weaponless, throws his own spear, which strikes Achilles's shield but is repelled. He calls to Deiphobus for another spear, only to realize he is alone and that a god has deceived him. Accepting his fate, Hector draws his sword and charges Achilles. Achilles, knowing the single vulnerable spot on Patroclus's former armor (now worn by Hector)—the joint between neck and throat—thrusts his spear there. Hector falls, mortally wounded.

Achilles boasts over the dying Hector, refusing his plea for his body to be ransomed and threatening to leave it to dogs and vultures. Hector, with his last breath, prophesies Achilles's death at the Scaean Gate by Paris and Apollo. Hector dies, and his soul flies to Hades. Achilles, accepting his own prophesied death, strips Hector's armor, and other Greeks stab the body. Achilles then performs a savage act of vengeance: he pierces Hector's ankles, binds his feet with thongs, and ties him to his chariot. He drags Hector's body three times around Patroclus's tomb and then to his tent.

Priam and Hecuba witness this horrific spectacle from the walls and lament uncontrollably. Andromache, unaware of Hector's death, is in the palace weaving. She hears the wailing from the walls and rushes out. She sees Hector's body being dragged and swoons. Upon reviving, she laments her husband's death, fears for their son Astyanax's future as an orphan and slave, and decides to burn Hector's unused garments as a funeral rite.

**Book XXIII: Funeral Games in Honour of Patroclus**
The Greeks return to their ships, mourning Hector. Achilles gathers his Myrmidons, ordering them to drive their chariots three times around Patroclus's body as a funeral rite. Achilles then places his hands on Patroclus's cold breast, vowing that Hector's body will be devoured by dogs and that twelve Trojan captives will be sacrificed on Patroclus's pyre. He casts Hector's body face down before the bier.

The Greeks feast, but Achilles refuses to wash until Patroclus is buried. He tells Agamemnon to prepare a funeral pyre at dawn. The next morning, a chosen band of Greeks, led by Merion, goes to Mount Ida to fell timber. They bring the wood back to the shore. Achilles leads a solemn procession of chariots and foot soldiers, with Patroclus's body on a bier. Achilles cuts a lock of his own hair, vowed to the river Sperchius, and places it on Patroclus's hand.

The pyre is built, and Patroclus's body is placed on it. Achilles sacrifices numerous sheep, oxen, goats, four horses, and nine dogs around the body. Finally, he sacrifices twelve Trojan captives on the pyre. He calls on Patroclus's ghost, reiterating his vows. Though Achilles threatens to leave Hector's body to dogs, Apollo protects it from defilement. The pyre does not ignite, so Achilles prays to the Winds (Zephyr and Boreas). Iris, sent by Achilles's prayer, relays the message to the Winds, who rush forth, creating a storm that ignites the pyre. The fire burns all night, with Achilles mourning.

At dawn, the flames subside. Achilles orders the remaining flames to be quenched with wine. The Greeks collect Patroclus's bones, place them in a golden urn, and build a large mound over the ashes, a tomb for Patroclus.

Achilles then announces the funeral games to honor Patroclus, offering various prizes:
1.  **Chariot Race:** Prizes include a skilled woman, a large vase, a mare, a charger, golden talents, and a double bowl. Achilles states his immortal horses will not race. Eumelus, Diomed, Menelaus, Antilochus, and Merion compete. Nestor advises his son Antilochus on strategy. During the race, Apollo causes Diomed to drop his whip, but Pallas returns it and then causes Eumelus's chariot to crash. Diomed wins first prize. Antilochus (second) is challenged by Menelaus for cunning, but Menelaus is appeased by Antilochus's apology. Merion takes fourth. Achilles gives Nestor an honorary prize.
2.  **Boxing:** Epeüs boasts and easily defeats Euryalus with a powerful blow.
3.  **Wrestling:** Ajax Telamon and Ulysses grapple fiercely. Achilles declares a tie and gives them equal prizes.
4.  **Foot-Race:** Oilean Ajax, Ulysses, and Antilochus compete. Pallas trips Ajax, allowing Ulysses to win. Ajax complains about divine interference. Antilochus takes the third prize.
5.  **Single Combat (Spear and Shield):** Diomed and Ajax Telamon fight. Achilles stops the combat before a decisive blow, declaring both valiant. Diomed receives the sword prize.
6.  **Discus Throw:** Polypoetes wins by throwing a massive iron quoit the furthest.
7.  **Archery:** Teucer shoots first, cutting the cord that holds the target dove, but missing the bird itself. Merion then shoots and kills the dove in flight. Merion wins the double axes, Teucer the single.
8.  **Javelin Throw:** Agamemnon and Merion compete. Achilles awards the spear to Merion and gives the charger to Agamemnon as a sign of his kingly status.

**Book XXIV: The Redemption of the Body of Hector**
After the funeral games, the Greeks feast and sleep, except for Achilles, who continues to mourn Patroclus. Every morning for twelve days, Achilles, in his grief and rage, drags Hector's body thrice around Patroclus's tomb. Apollo protects Hector's corpse from mutilation and decay. The gods are moved by pity for Hector, and Hermes proposes stealing the body, but Juno (still angry at Troy due to Paris's judgment) and others refuse.

On the twelfth day, Apollo addresses the assembly of the gods, condemning Achilles's savagery and constant defilement of Hector's body, arguing Hector was pious and deserves burial rites. Juno defends Achilles. Jupiter intervenes, agreeing that Hector deserves burial. He sends Thetis to Achilles to command him to release Hector's body for ransom, and Iris to Priam to instruct him to go alone to Achilles with gifts. Hermes will guide and protect Priam.

Iris delivers Jove's command to Priam, who is distraught with grief. Priam resolves to go, despite Hecuba's pleas and fears that Achilles will kill him. Priam insists, trusting Jove's command, and gathers rich gifts. He rages at his surviving sons for their perceived weakness. Priam's sons prepare the mule cart for gifts and the royal chariot. Hecuba offers a libation to Jove, and Priam prays for a good omen. Jove sends an eagle as a favorable sign.

Priam and the herald Idæus set out. Jupiter sends Hermes, disguised as a young man, to guide and protect them. Hermes meets them near the river Xanthus, calms Priam's fear, and reveals his identity and mission. He leads the chariot through the sleeping Greek camp, putting the guards to sleep and opening the gates. Hermes brings them to Achilles's tent, then vanishes after instructing Priam on how to appeal to Achilles.

Priam enters Achilles's tent, where Achilles is dining with Automedon and Alcimus. Priam falls at Achilles's feet, embracing his knees and kissing his hands, which killed his son. He appeals to Achilles to remember his own father, Peleus, and to pity his old age and immense sorrow at the loss of so many sons, especially Hector. Achilles is deeply moved, remembering his own father and Patroclus. They both weep together.

Achilles raises Priam and gently consoles him, speaking of man's common fate and Jove's distribution of good and evil. He agrees to release Hector's body. He orders his handmaids to wash and anoint Hector's body out of Priam's sight. Achilles then places Hector's body on the funeral couch and speaks to Patroclus's shade, asking forgiveness for releasing Hector but affirming it is Jove's will.

Achilles invites Priam to eat, which the old king finally does. Achilles then asks Priam how long he needs for Hector's funeral rites. Priam requests twelve days: nine for mourning, the tenth for the funeral, the eleventh for building the tomb, and the twelfth for resuming war. Achilles grants the twelve-day truce.

Hermes awakens Priam before dawn, urging him to leave quickly before the Greeks discover him. Hermes guides them through the camp and leaves them at the Xanthus river. At dawn, Priam and Idæus return to Troy with Hector's body. Cassandra first spots them from the walls, raising the alarm. The Trojans rush out to meet the wain, lamenting. Priam orders them to take the body to the palace. Hector's body is laid on a bed of state.

Andromache, Hecuba, and Helen lead the lamentations over Hector's body. Andromache weeps for her husband and fears for their son Astyanax. Hecuba praises Hector's piety and notes how the gods preserved his body. Helen mourns Hector as her only friend in Troy, who always defended her from scorn.

Priam orders the Trojans to gather wood for the pyre. For nine days, they fell trees. On the tenth day, Hector's body is placed on the pyre and burned. On the eleventh day, his bones are collected in a golden urn, wrapped in purple, and buried under a mound, raising a tomb. Guards watch these rites. Finally, the Trojans return to Priam's court for a funeral feast. The text concludes with the peaceful sleep of Hector's shade."

**Part 1: The Custom-House (The Narrator's Account and Discovery)**

The narrative begins with the author describing his experience as a Surveyor of the Revenue at the Custom-House in his native town of Salem, Massachusetts. He details the dilapidated state of the wharf and the brick edifice of the Custom-House, adorned with a vertically striped American flag and an intimidating American eagle sculpture. He describes the Custom-House officers, mostly elderly men and former sea-captains, often found sleeping or repeating old stories. Among them are a permanent Inspector, an old man of fourscore years, robust and focused on physical pleasures, and the Collector, a gallant old General, venerable for his military service but now frail and reflective.

The narrator recounts his own literary faculties becoming dormant during his time in office, feeling disconnected from creative writing and concerned about his intellect dwindling. He views his position as a temporary one, anticipating a change.

One rainy day, while rummaging in an unfinished second-story room of the Custom-House, the narrator discovers a small package wrapped in ancient yellow parchment. Inside, he finds an official commission for one Jonathan Pue, a former Surveyor of His Majesty’s Customs for Salem, who died about eighty years prior. Along with the commission are private documents, written by Pue, which contain materials from his antiquarian researches.

The most striking object in the package is a piece of fine red cloth, much worn and faded, with traces of gold embroidery. Upon careful examination, it assumes the shape of a capital letter A, precisely three and a quarter inches in length. Its original purpose is unclear to the narrator, but he feels a strange interest in it. When he instinctively places the scarlet letter on his breast, he experiences a sensation of burning heat, as if it were red-hot iron, causing him to shudder and drop it.

He then discovers a small roll of dingy paper twisted around the letter. This manuscript, written by Surveyor Pue, provides a ""reasonably complete explanation of the whole affair."" It details the life and ""sufferings"" of one Hester Prynne, a ""noteworthy personage"" who lived between early Massachusetts and the late seventeenth century. Pue's narrative was compiled from the oral testimony of aged persons who remembered Hester as a stately, solemn woman, a voluntary nurse who gave advice. The narrator states that the ""main facts"" of the story he is about to tell, titled ""THE SCARLET LETTER,"" are ""authorized and authenticated"" by Mr. Pue’s document, though he admits to taking artistic license with motives and passions.

The narrator sees this discovery as the groundwork for a tale. He experiences a ghostly vision of Mr. Surveyor Pue, who appears in his memorable wig and exhorts him to publish his findings about ""old Mistress Prynne,"" promising profit and credit. The narrator agrees.

His imagination, previously stagnant, is rekindled. He describes how his forced removal from the Custom-House, following General Taylor's election, allowed him to return to writing. He reflects on the ""subtle disease"" that public office inflicts on character, making men dependent and weak. His ""decapitation"" from office, though painful, frees him to become a literary man again. He mentions that ""some of the briefer articles"" in the volume were written after his withdrawal, and others gleaned from old magazines.

**Part 2: The Scarlet Letter (The Story of Hester Prynne)**

**I. The Prison-Door**
In a new colony (implied to be Boston), a crowd of solemn, grim-faced Puritans gathers before the heavy, iron-spiked door of the wooden prison. The founders of the colony, recognizing the necessity, had established a prison and a cemetery early on. A wild rose-bush, rooted beside the prison door, offers delicate beauty that could symbolize pity for the condemned.

**II. The Market-Place**
On a summer morning, a large crowd watches the prison door. Women in the crowd express harsh opinions about the expected punishment. Some suggest branding Hester Prynne's forehead, others believe she deserves death for bringing shame. The jailer, Master Brackett, opens the door.

Hester Prynne emerges, holding her three-month-old infant, who has only known the dim light of the prison. Hester, a tall woman of elegant figure and striking beauty, wears an elaborately embroidered scarlet capital letter A on her breast. Her attire, splendid and beyond colony regulations, makes her appear transfigured by the symbol of her ignominy. She endures the crowd's stares with a haughty smile but burning blush. The beadle leads her to a scaffold in the market-place, the platform of a pillory, where she is sentenced to stand for three hours. She undergoes an intense internal agony, recalling memories of her English village, her parents, and a scholar-like man with a slight deformity, before returning to the harsh reality of her present shame.

**III. The Recognition**
Hester's gaze is fixed on a white man standing with an Indian on the outskirts of the crowd. The man, small with a furrowed, intelligent face and one shoulder higher than the other, recognizes Hester, and his face twists with horror before he controls his emotions. He places a finger on his lips, signaling silence. He asks a townsman about Hester's identity and crime. The townsman identifies her as Mistress Hester Prynne, who has caused ""great scandal"" and refuses to name the father of her child. He explains that Hester's husband, a learned Englishman, had sent her ahead to Boston two years prior but has not been heard from, leading the magistrates to sentence her to public shame and lifelong wearing of the scarlet letter instead of death.

The stranger, with a ""bitter smile,"" identifies himself as a wanderer recently freed from Indian captivity. He remarks on the magistrates' ""wise sentence"" but vows that the father of the child ""will be known!"" He whispers to the Indian, and they leave the crowd.

Reverend John Wilson, an elder clergyman, urges Hester to confess the father's name. Governor Bellingham supports this, placing the responsibility on young Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale, Hester's pastor. Dimmesdale, a pale, nervous, and scholarly young minister, appeals to Hester to confess for the sake of her soul and the father's peace, warning against hypocrisy. Hester, looking into Dimmesdale's ""troubled eyes,"" refuses, stating the letter is ""too deeply branded"" and she wishes she could endure the father's agony as well as her own. A voice from the crowd demands she ""give your child a father!"" Hester, turning pale, recognizes the voice but defiantly states her child ""shall never know an earthly one!"" Dimmesdale murmurs, ""She will not speak!"" Mr. Wilson then delivers a sermon on sin, during which Hester remains impassive, while her infant cries. Hester is led back to prison, the scarlet letter reportedly casting a ""lurid gleam"" as she vanishes.

**IV. The Interview**
Back in prison, Hester is in a state of nervous excitement. Master Brackett, the jailer, summons a physician for Hester and her convulsing infant. The physician is Roger Chillingworth, the stranger from the market-place and Hester’s husband. He administers a calming draught to the baby, which quickly takes effect, and then to Hester, remarking that it will calm her passions.

Chillingworth reveals his identity as Hester's husband, acknowledging his folly in marrying her, an old deformed scholar to her youth and beauty. He declares they have wronged each other but promises no vengeance on her. Instead, he vows to find and seek revenge on the father of her child, the man who wronged them both. He says he will find him through ""sympathy"" and ""read it on his heart,"" promising not to reveal him to human law or harm his life, but that he ""shall be mine!"" Hester, appalled, calls his words ""terror."" Chillingworth extracts an oath of secrecy from Hester regarding his identity, threatening dire consequences for the father if she reveals him. Hester swears the oath. Chillingworth then leaves, smiling ominously, and Hester wonders if he is the ""Black Man"" and if her bond with him will ruin her soul. He replies, ""Not thy soul.""

**V. Hester at Her Needle**
Hester's prison term ends. Though free to leave the colony, she remains, compelled by a ""fatality"" and an irresistible connection to the father of her child, whom she believes she will meet at the ""bar of final judgment."" She hopes her prolonged suffering will purge her soul. She settles in a remote, thatched cottage on the town's outskirts.

She supports herself and her daughter, Pearl, through exquisite needlework, which becomes fashionable, adorning the garments of governors, military men, and ministers, and even burial shrouds. However, her skill is never employed for a bride's veil. Hester dresses herself plainly in coarse gray, only adorned by the scarlet A, but clothes Pearl in magnificent, elaborately embroidered crimson velvet, making the child a living representation of the scarlet letter. Hester gives her surplus earnings to charity, often enduring insults from those she helps.

Hester remains an outcast, experiencing constant public scorn and inner torment. She develops a peculiar sensibility, believing the scarlet letter gives her sympathetic knowledge of hidden sin in others' hearts, which she sees reflected even in pious individuals. The townspeople spread rumors that her scarlet letter glows with infernal fire at night.

**VI. Pearl**
Hester names her daughter Pearl, as she was ""of great price."" Pearl is a beautiful, intelligent, but wild and unruly child, embodying her mother's ""impassioned state"" and ""spiritual warfare."" Hester struggles to discipline her. Pearl is an outcast among Puritan children, who mock her, and she retaliates with hatred.

Pearl's first conscious awareness was the scarlet letter on Hester's breast. She frequently gazes at it and, as a toddler, flings flowers at it. Pearl asks Hester about the ""Black Man"" in the forest, who makes people sign his book with their blood and sets his mark on their bosoms. Pearl asks if the scarlet letter is his mark, and Hester eventually admits, ""Once in my life I met the Black Man! This scarlet letter is his mark!"" Pearl also repeatedly asks why her mother wears the letter and ""why does the minister keep his hand over his heart?"" Hester, unwilling to reveal the truth, becomes irritated.

**VII. The Governor’s Hall**
Hester goes to Governor Bellingham's mansion, ostensibly to deliver embroidered gloves, but primarily to defend her right to keep Pearl, as some prominent citizens wish to remove the child from her care, believing Pearl to be of demon origin or in need of better guardianship. Pearl, dressed in her crimson and gold finery, is likened to a living scarlet letter. Puritan children attempt to assault them with mud, but Pearl chases them off.

Inside the Governor's hall, among ancestral portraits and a suit of gleaming armor, Pearl sees her mother's scarlet letter reflected in the breastplate in exaggerated proportions, making Hester seem hidden behind it. Pearl points at the reflection and smiles, an ""elfish intelligence"" in her features. Hester tries to distract her in the garden, where Pearl cries for a red rose.

**VIII. The Elf-Child and the Minister**
Governor Bellingham, Mr. Wilson, Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale, and Roger Chillingworth (now the minister's physician) enter. The Governor and Mr. Wilson question Pearl about her Christian upbringing, to which Pearl defiantly replies she was ""plucked by her mother off the bush of wild roses that grew by the prison-door."" Chillingworth notes Pearl's wildness.

Bellingham implies Pearl should be removed from Hester's care. Hester fiercely declares that God gave her Pearl as both happiness and torture, and that Pearl is the ""scarlet letter, only capable of being loved,"" keeping her alive and punishing her. She vows to die before giving Pearl up. Hester desperately appeals to Dimmesdale to speak for her, saying he knows her heart and a mother's rights.

Dimmesdale, pale and clutching his heart, advocates for Hester, arguing that God gave her the child as a blessing and a retribution to keep her soul alive. He states that the ""sinful mother is happier than the sinful father"" and that Hester should be allowed to raise Pearl. The magistrates agree, stipulating only that Pearl receive catechism instruction and attend school. Pearl, in a rare moment of tenderness, approaches Dimmesdale, takes his hand, and lays her cheek against it. He kisses her brow, but she then laughs and capers away.

As Hester and Pearl depart, Mistress Hibbins, the Governor's sister (reputed to be a witch), invites Hester to ride with her into the forest to meet the ""Black Man."" Hester refuses, saying she must guard Pearl, but adds that if Pearl had been taken, she would have willingly gone and signed her name in the Black Man's book with her own blood. Mistress Hibbins ominously replies, ""We shall have thee there anon!""

**IX. The Leech**
Roger Chillingworth, Hester's husband, has adopted his new identity and settled in Boston as a physician. He cultivates an intimacy with Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale, whose health has been failing due to intense study, fasts, and vigils. The community views Chillingworth's timely arrival as providential, hoping he will cure their beloved minister. However, some begin to notice an ""ugly and evil"" change in Chillingworth's face, suspecting he is Satan's emissary sent to torment Dimmesdale.

**X. The Leech and His Patient**
Chillingworth, now consumed by revenge, subtly probes Dimmesdale's inner life like a ""dark miner."" Dimmesdale, due to his own morbid heart, is suspicious of mankind but does not recognize Chillingworth as his enemy.

One day, Chillingworth questions Dimmesdale about strange herbs he found growing on an unmarked grave, suggesting they symbolize unconfessed sin. Dimmesdale argues that only God can reveal such secrets. Chillingworth presses him to confess his ""wound or trouble in your soul"" to be healed physically. Dimmesdale passionately refuses to confess to an ""earthly physician,"" committing himself to God, and rushes out of the room. Chillingworth smiles gravely, noting Dimmesdale's passion.

Their intimacy is restored, and Chillingworth continues his medical supervision, always leaving Dimmesdale's apartment with a mysterious, puzzled smile. One noonday, Dimmesdale falls asleep in his chair. Chillingworth enters, thrusts aside Dimmesdale's vestment, and lays his hand on the minister's bosom. Dimmesdale shudders. Chillingworth turns away with a ""wild look of wonder, joy, and horror,"" as if Satan had just claimed a soul.

**XI. The Interior of a Heart**
Chillingworth's path to revenge is now clear. He intends to subtly torment Dimmesdale, using his knowledge to play upon the minister's fears and remorse. Dimmesdale has a ""dim perception of some evil influence"" but cannot identify it. He hates Chillingworth but attributes it to his own ""morbid spot,"" continuing their social familiarity.

Despite his inner torment and physical decline, Dimmesdale achieves brilliant popularity as a minister. His eloquent sermons, filled with pathos, are seen by the people as miracles of holiness, even as he secretly scourges himself, fasts, and holds vigils, seeing visions of diabolic shapes, his dead parents, and Hester and Pearl pointing at his breast. He repeatedly attempts to confess his vileness from the pulpit, but his vague words only increase the people's reverence for his perceived humility. He views himself as a ""pollution and a lie."" One night, driven by a new thought, he steals out of his dwelling.

**XII. The Minister’s Vigil**
Dimmesdale reaches the scaffold where Hester stood seven years ago and ascends its steps in the dark. He imagines the town finding him there. He hears his own shriek, but the town remains asleep. He sees Governor Bellingham and Mistress Hibbins at their windows, startled but not discovering him. Reverend Mr. Wilson passes by, returning from Governor Winthrop's deathbed, but does not see Dimmesdale.

Dimmesdale, laughing in grotesque horror, calls out ""Pearl! Little Pearl!"" and ""Hester! Hester Prynne! Are you there?"" Hester, who has been watching at Governor Winthrop's deathbed, responds and brings Pearl onto the scaffold. Dimmesdale takes Pearl's hand, feeling a ""tumultuous rush of new life,"" an ""electric chain"" between the three. Pearl asks if he will stand with them ""to-morrow noontide."" Dimmesdale, fearing public exposure, refuses, but promises ""At the great judgment day."" Pearl laughs.

A meteor gleams across the sky, and Dimmesdale, in his disordered state, perceives it as an immense letter A. He then sees Pearl pointing at Roger Chillingworth, who has approached the scaffold. Dimmesdale, filled with terror, asks Hester, ""Who is that man, Hester? ... I hate him, Hester!"" Hester, bound by her oath, remains silent. Pearl whispers something unintelligible to Dimmesdale and then scolds him for not being ""bold"" or ""true"" by refusing to stand with them publicly. Chillingworth approaches, feigning concern for Dimmesdale's health, and leads him home.

The next day, Dimmesdale preaches his most powerful sermon. Afterward, the sexton finds Dimmesdale's glove on the scaffold and mentions the meteor, which people now interpret as an A for ""Angel"" in honor of the deceased Governor Winthrop. Dimmesdale denies hearing of it.

**XIII. Another View of Hester**
Hester is shocked by Dimmesdale's deteriorated state and recognizes her responsibility to him. She resolves to reveal Chillingworth's true identity to Dimmesdale, believing their ""mutual crime"" has created an ""iron link"" between them.

Seven years have passed, and Pearl is seven. Hester's constant acts of charity and blameless life have softened public opinion. The scarlet letter is now interpreted by many as meaning ""Able,"" not just ""Adulterer,"" due to her strength and helpfulness during times of calamity. However, her character has become colder and more reflective, her beauty faded. She has developed a freedom of thought that questions societal norms. She recognizes Chillingworth's revenge is transforming Dimmesdale towards insanity, and she feels guilty for allowing this deception. She resolves to meet Chillingworth and end his torment of Dimmesdale.

**XIV. Hester and the Physician**
Hester confronts Chillingworth by the seashore, sending Pearl to play. Chillingworth informs her that magistrates have considered removing her scarlet letter due to her good deeds, but Hester states it will fall off when she is worthy. Hester observes Chillingworth's transformation into a man with a fierce, evil look, often masked by a derisive smile, his soul ""on fire."" She recognizes him as a ""striking evidence of man’s faculty of transforming himself into a devil.""

Hester reveals her regret for keeping Chillingworth's identity secret, accusing him of causing Dimmesdale a ""living death."" Chillingworth counters that revealing him would have led to Dimmesdale's execution, and that he has prolonged Dimmesdale's life, asserting that Dimmesdale's spirit could not have borne the burden as Hester's has. Chillingworth then openly declares his fiendish revenge, admitting he has become a tormentor for Dimmesdale, saying, ""A mortal man, with once a human heart, has become a fiend for his especial torment!"" Hester asks if he has tortured Dimmesdale enough. Chillingworth replies, ""He has but increased the debt!"" He laments his own transformation from a kind, studious man. Hester cries that she is equally responsible for his transformation. She urges him to forgive and leave retribution to God. Chillingworth refuses, declaring that their fate was sealed by Hester's ""first step awry"" and that he has merely taken ""a fiend’s office."" He dismisses her, telling her to ""deal as thou wilt with yonder man.""

**XV. Hester and Pearl**
Hester watches Chillingworth depart, reflecting on her hatred for him and her past marriage, which she now deems her greatest crime. Pearl, playing by the brook, makes herself a mermaid costume from seaweed and fashions a green letter A from eel-grass for her own bosom. She asks Hester the meaning of the scarlet letter, and why the minister keeps his hand over his heart. Hester, struggling, lies that she wears it for the gold-thread. Pearl, with mischief, repeatedly asks the same questions, making Hester agitated.

**XVI. A Forest Walk**
Hester resolves to tell Dimmesdale about Chillingworth. She seeks him on his meditative walks in the forest. She takes Pearl with her. The dark, winding forest path reflects Hester's ""moral wilderness."" Pearl observes that the sunshine avoids Hester and tries to catch it herself, saying it won't flee from her. Pearl asks for a story about the ""Black Man"" who haunts the forest and sets his mark on people. Hester admits, ""Once in my life I met the Black Man! This scarlet letter is his mark!"" Pearl spots Dimmesdale approaching, noting his hand over his heart, and questions if it's the Black Man's mark. Hester sends Pearl away to play. Dimmesdale appears haggard and feeble, leaning on a staff.

**XVII. The Pastor and His Parishioner**
Hester calls to Dimmesdale, who is startled and fears she is a shadow. They meet in the forest, like ghosts. Hester asks if he has found peace; he replies, ""None!—nothing but despair!"" He laments that his public reverence only increases his misery, as it highlights his hidden sin. He yearns for someone to know him as the ""vilest of all sinners.""

Hester then reveals Chillingworth's true identity: ""That old man!—the physician!—he whom they call Roger Chillingworth!—he was my husband!"" Dimmesdale is enraged, collapsing in despair, and cries, ""I cannot forgive thee!"" Hester begs for his forgiveness, embracing him. Dimmesdale eventually forgives her, stating Chillingworth's revenge is ""blacker than my sin."" They reaffirm their love, with Hester suggesting their past sin had ""a consecration of its own.""

Dimmesdale expresses fear about Chillingworth's future revenge, now that he knows Hester's intent to reveal him. Hester believes Chillingworth's secretive nature means he won't betray them immediately, but will seek other revenge. Hester urges Dimmesdale to flee the colony, either into the wilderness or across the sea to Europe, to escape Chillingworth's influence and start a new, true life. Dimmesdale, broken, says he lacks the strength to go alone. Hester whispers, ""Thou shalt not go alone!""

**XVIII. A Flood of Sunshine**
Dimmesdale is filled with hope and joy, mixed with fear. Hester, having lived as an outlaw, has developed a bold freedom of thought. Dimmesdale resolves to flee with Hester. Hester unclasps the scarlet letter from her bosom and throws it away, and removes her cap, letting her hair fall. Her beauty, youth, and warmth return, and sunshine floods the previously gloomy forest. Hester calls Pearl to meet Dimmesdale, who is uneasy around children.

Pearl slowly approaches. The forest, usually stern, is gentle with Pearl, offering her berries and allowing wild animals to interact with her. Pearl, adorned with wild flowers, appears as a ""nymph-child.""

**XIX. The Child at the Brook-Side**
Hester and Dimmesdale watch Pearl approach. Hester remarks on Pearl's beauty and resemblance to Dimmesdale. Pearl stands across the brook, gazing at them, her reflection in the water. Dimmesdale feels a tremor, sensing a boundary. Pearl refuses to cross the brook despite Hester's sweet calls, instead pointing at her mother's breast. Hester realizes Pearl misses the scarlet letter. Dimmesdale urges Hester to pacify the child. Hester retrieves the scarlet letter and fastens it back on her bosom. As she does so, her beauty vanishes, a ""gray shadow"" falls upon her, and a sense of ""inevitable doom"" returns. Pearl then bounds across the brook and embraces Hester, but also kisses the scarlet letter.

Pearl then asks Dimmesdale if he will walk ""hand in hand, we three together, into the town?"" Hester says not now, but in the future. Pearl asks if he will ""always keep his hand over his heart?"" Pearl refuses Dimmesdale's kiss, washing it off in the brook. Hester and Dimmesdale continue their plans.

**XX. The Minister in a Maze**
Dimmesdale leaves Hester and Pearl, recalling their plan to escape to the Old World on a ship sailing for Bristol in three days, which would allow him to preach his Election Sermon first. As he returns to town, he feels an unaccustomed physical energy but also strange, wicked impulses: to utter blasphemous words to a deacon, to whisper an argument against the immortality of the soul to a pious widow, to plant a germ of evil in a pure maiden, to teach wicked words to children, and to curse with a drunken seaman. He questions if he is mad or if he has made a contract with the ""fiend."" Mistress Hibbins accosts him, hinting at his secret forest meeting and implying the ""Black Man"" will force him to reveal his mark. Dimmesdale feels his sin has infected his moral system. He reaches his study, where Chillingworth enters, offering aid for the Election Sermon. Dimmesdale refuses, claiming renewed health. Chillingworth departs, aware Dimmesdale now sees him as an enemy. Dimmesdale then burns his unfinished sermon and writes a new, inspired Election Sermon through the night.

**XXI. The New England Holiday**
On Election Day, Hester and Pearl go to the market-place, which is filled with townspeople, Indians, and mariners. Hester, wearing her plain gray dress and the scarlet letter, feels a quiet triumph, anticipating her freedom. Pearl is gaily dressed, her vivacity reflecting her mother's unquiet mood. Pearl observes the festive atmosphere and asks Hester why the minister, who held their hands in the dark forest, now seems to ignore them in public, always keeping his hand over his heart. Hester tells her to be quiet.

The narrator describes the holiday amusements, including wrestling and swordplay. Indians and rough mariners are present. Roger Chillingworth is seen talking closely with the shipmaster of the vessel on which Hester and Dimmesdale plan to flee. The shipmaster then tells Hester that Chillingworth has arranged passage for himself and ""the gentleman she wots of"" on the ship. Hester is filled with ""utmost consternation"" and sees Chillingworth across the square, smiling with ""secret and fearful meaning,"" signaling ""inevitable doom."" Hester is surrounded by curious onlookers, making the scarlet letter burn more painfully than ever.

**XXII. The Procession**
Military music announces the procession. Pearl is captivated. The military escort is followed by civil magistrates. Then comes Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale, displaying unaccustomed energy and strength, though his mind seems elsewhere. Hester, watching him, feels a ""dreary influence,"" sensing his remoteness and doubting the reality of their forest encounter. Pearl asks if that was the minister who kissed her by the brook, noting his changed demeanor.

Mistress Hibbins approaches Hester, speaking conspiratorially about the minister's secret forest visits and his connection to the ""Black Man,"" hinting that his hidden mark will be revealed. She implies Pearl is ""of the lineage of the Prince of the Air!"" and will one day know why the minister keeps his hand over his heart. Mistress Hibbins departs with shrill laughter.

Hester, standing by the scaffold, listens to Dimmesdale's powerful sermon, detecting a ""deep, sad undertone of pathos"" and a ""cry of pain."" Pearl wanders among the crowd, interacting with Indians and mariners. The shipmaster gives Pearl a gold chain and then informs her that Chillingworth has booked passage for himself and Dimmesdale on their ship. Hester is deeply disturbed by this ""dark and grim countenance of an inevitable doom."" Hester endures the renewed stares of the crowd, the scarlet letter searing her breast.

**XXIII. The Revelation of the Scarlet Letter**
Dimmesdale's powerful Election Sermon concludes, eliciting widespread praise and emotion from the crowd, who believe him to be divinely inspired but also foresee his impending death. He stands at the peak of his triumph in the pulpit, while Hester stands by the scaffold.

The procession reforms to go to the banquet. Dimmesdale approaches the scaffold, looking feeble. John Wilson offers support, but Dimmesdale rejects it. He reaches the scaffold where Hester and Pearl stand. He stretches forth his arms and calls to them, his gaze ghastly yet tender and triumphant. Pearl runs to him. Hester slowly approaches.

Roger Chillingworth rushes through the crowd, seizing Dimmesdale's arm, and whispers, ""Madman, hold! what is your purpose? ... I can yet save you!"" Dimmesdale, with fear but firmness, replies, ""Ha, tempter! Methinks thou art too late! ... With God’s help, I shall escape thee now!"" He extends his hand to Hester, asking for her strength, and calls Chillingworth a ""wretched and wronged old man"" who opposes them with fiendish might. He asks Hester to support him onto the scaffold.

With Hester's support and Pearl's hand in his, Dimmesdale ascends the scaffold. Chillingworth follows, darkly stating that Dimmesdale could only have escaped him on ""this very scaffold!"" Dimmesdale thanks God for leading him there. Dimmesdale, a dying man, turns to the assembled crowd. With a high, solemn, trembling voice, he declares himself ""the one sinner of the world!"" He points to Hester's scarlet letter, which they have all shuddered at. He then declares that he bears a worse stigma, tearing away his ministerial band to reveal a ""ghastly miracle"" on his breast, the narrator refraining from describing it.

Dimmesdale collapses onto the scaffold. Hester supports him. Chillingworth kneels, his face blank, repeating, ""Thou hast escaped me!"" Dimmesdale replies, ""May God forgive thee! Thou, too, hast deeply sinned!"" He asks Pearl to kiss him, which she does, breaking a ""spell."" Her tears fall on his cheek, symbolizing her future amid ""human joy and sorrow."" Dimmesdale bids Hester farewell, saying they broke God's law and cannot hope for an ""everlasting and pure reunion"" in eternity, but that God has shown mercy through his suffering and Chillingworth's torment. He dies with the word ""Farewell!""

**Part 3: Conclusion (Aftermath)**

After Dimmesdale's death, different accounts circulate regarding what was seen on his breast. Most spectators claim to have seen a scarlet letter, like Hester's, imprinted on his flesh. Its origin is debated: self-inflicted penance, Chillingworth's magic, or the ""tooth of remorse."" Some witnesses, however, deny any mark and believe Dimmesdale's death was a parable demonstrating the futility of human righteousness before God. The narrator's primary source, Surveyor Pue's manuscript, confirms the existence of the mark and the shared guilt, concluding with the moral: ""Be true! Be true! Be true! Show freely to the world, if not your worst, yet some trait whereby the worst may be inferred!""

Immediately after Dimmesdale's death, Roger Chillingworth rapidly declines, withering away and dying within a year, having lost his purpose of revenge. His significant property is bequeathed to Pearl.

Pearl, now a rich heiress, disappears with Hester. For many years, vague reports of them surface from across the sea. After a long absence, Hester Prynne returns alone to her old cottage in Salem, still wearing the scarlet letter. She lives out her life there, the letter transforming from a stigma into a symbol of reverence, as people seek her counsel for their sorrows. Hester expresses a belief that a ""new truth"" will be revealed to establish a surer foundation for man-woman relationships, but recognizes her sin prevents her from being its prophetess.

After many years, Hester dies and is buried in the King's Chapel burial-ground, near an old, sunken grave (implied to be Dimmesdale's), with a space between them. One simple slate tombstone serves for both, bearing an engraved escutcheon with the motto: ""ON A FIELD, SABLE, THE LETTER A, GULES."" This is the conclusion of the legend."
Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea-Jules Verne,"The year 1866 was marked by the appearance of a mysterious, enormous, spindle-shaped, and sometimes phosphorescent object in the world's oceans. Initial sightings by the steamer *Governor Higginson* off Australia and the *Columbus* in the Pacific revealed its astonishing speed and suggested it was an unknown aquatic mammal. Later, the *Helvetia* and *Shannon* simultaneously observed it in the Atlantic, estimating its length at over 350 feet. Public opinion was further agitated by a collision between the *Etna* and the phenomenon. Initially, there was a debate among scientists, with many dismissing it as fable, but new incidents in 1867, where the *Moravian* and *Scotia* were struck and severely damaged by a sharp, powerful object, transformed the mystery into a serious danger.

M. Pierre Aronnax, an Assistant Professor at the Museum of Natural History in Paris, arrived in New York just as the public demanded action. After ruling out floating islands or enormous wrecks, two main theories remained: a colossal marine monster or a submarine vessel. The latter was discounted due to the impossibility of secret construction by a private individual or a government. Aronnax published an article on April 30, proposing the existence of a gigantic, electrically charged narwhal, armed with a powerful spur, capable of withstanding immense deep-sea pressures and inflicting the damage observed. This theory gained traction, and the United States government commissioned the frigate *Abraham Lincoln*, commanded by Captain Farragut, to hunt the monster.

After a two-month lull in sightings, the monster was seen again in the North Pacific. Aronnax, invited by the U.S. Secretary of Marine, joined the expedition. He left his faithful Flemish servant, Conseil, to pack, and despite his longing for home, accepted the ""glorious but dangerous"" mission. The *Abraham Lincoln*, a fast frigate, departed Brooklyn, amidst public fanfare, heading into the Atlantic.

On board, Captain Farragut was resolute in his belief and determination to destroy the monster. The crew was equally enthusiastic, motivated by a $2,000 reward. Ned Land, a Canadian harpooner of exceptional skill and experience, was the only one who doubted the monster's existence, believing no animal could damage an iron ship. Aronnax attempted to convince him with a scientific explanation of deep-sea pressure and the strength required for such a creature.

The *Abraham Lincoln* sailed rapidly, rounding Cape Horn and entering the Pacific. For three months, the search was fruitless, leading to growing discontent among the crew and many false alarms. Captain Farragut eventually conceded, promising to turn back in three days if the monster didn't appear. On the night of November 5, just as the deadline was approaching, Ned Land sighted an intense, inexplicable electric light two cables' length from the frigate.

The object, an electrical ""narwhal,"" moved with incredible speed, far outmaneuvering the *Abraham Lincoln*. It circled the frigate, enveloping it in luminous rings, then rushed towards it before disappearing and reappearing. Captain Farragut, astonished, decided to wait for daylight. The creature's loud strokes and panting were heard through the night. The next morning, November 6, after a sea fog lifted, Ned Land sighted the monster again. Aronnax estimated its length at 250 feet, confirming its mammalian nature. The frigate pursued it at full steam, but the creature matched and exceeded its speed, playing with the vessel. Farragut ordered the forecastle gun fired, and one shot hit the monster, but glanced off its rounded surface.

As night fell, the monster reappeared, motionless. Farragut attempted a stealth attack. Ned Land, from the bowsprit, threw his harpoon, striking a hard body. The light went out, two enormous waterspouts broke over the frigate, and a fearful shock threw Aronnax into the sea.

Aronnax was saved by Conseil, who had followed him into the water. Conseil reported that the frigate's screw and rudder were broken. Aronnax's strength failed, but Ned Land appeared, having found footing on the ""gigantic narwhal"" itself. He revealed that his harpoon was blunted because the ""beast is made of sheet iron."" Aronnax realized the ""monster"" was a sophisticated submarine boat, a ""human construction.""

Eight masked men abducted Aronnax, Conseil, and Ned Land into the submarine. They were imprisoned in a dark, iron-walled cabin. The cabin was then illuminated by intense electric light. Two strangers entered, one of them, the chief, speaking an unknown language. Aronnax, Ned, and Conseil attempted to communicate in French, English, German, and Latin, but failed. A silent steward brought them a meal of sea-based dishes. Aronnax noted the elegant dinnerware engraved with ""MOBILIS IN MOBILI"" and the letter ""N."" Aronnax eventually slept, feeling the machine sinking.

Upon waking, Aronnax realized the heavy air indicated oxygen depletion. He felt the boat surface, inhale fresh air, and then submerge again. Ned Land, tormented by hunger, attacked the silent steward. At that moment, the chief spoke in perfect French, revealing he understood all their languages and knew their identities. He introduced himself as Captain Nemo and his vessel as the *Nautilus*. He justified his actions by stating they had attacked him and sought to penetrate his secret. He declared he was not a ""civilised man,"" having broken all ties with humanity, and now lived by his own laws beneath the sea. He informed them they were now his prisoners, free to move about the *Nautilus*, but would never be permitted to leave. The only condition was passive obedience during ""unforeseen events."" Ned Land openly refused to give his word of honor, but Nemo simply stated he hadn't asked for it. Aronnax protested the ""slavery,"" but Nemo countered that it was ""clemency,"" as he could have plunged them to the ocean depths. He revealed his knowledge of Aronnax's scientific work and promised him a unique opportunity to explore the ""land of marvels.""

Captain Nemo gave Aronnax a tour of the *Nautilus*, revealing it was powered entirely by electricity derived from seawater (sodium chloride). It was 232 feet long, double-hulled, and incredibly strong. Its diving and surfacing were controlled by filling and emptying reservoirs, and its movement by a screw and inclined planes. A powerful electric reflector allowed underwater vision. Nemo explained its construction, with parts sourced globally and assembled on a desert island, all traces then destroyed. He also revealed his immense wealth, derived from sunken treasures.

The *Nautilus* then sailed into the Pacific. Aronnax, Ned, and Conseil were often allowed to observe the stunning submarine world through the saloon's large glass panels, filled with diverse marine life attracted by the electric light. On November 16, Nemo invited them on a hunting party to Crespo Island. Ned was excited for ""terra firma,"" but Nemo explained it was a *submarine* forest. Using Rouquayrol apparatuses for breathing (air stored at 50 atmospheres, lasting 9-10 hours) and Ruhmkorff lamps for light (though unnecessary due to shallow depth), they walked on the seabed. Ned remained on board, but Conseil joined Aronnax. They encountered various marine flora and fauna, including a monstrous sea-spider. On their return, they were ambushed by two formidable sharks, but Nemo, pulling Aronnax to the ground, ensured their safety.

Later, the *Nautilus* encountered a tragic sight: the sunken ship *The Florida*, with its dead crew, including a mother and infant, still bound to its deck. Later, near Vanikoro (where La Perouse was lost), Nemo revealed he knew the true fate of La Perouse's third boat, showing a tin-plate box containing his instructions. He expressed a desire for a ""coral tomb"" for himself and his crew, safe from ""sharks and men.""

The *Nautilus* navigated the dangerous Torres Straits, where it ran aground near Gilboa Island. Nemo, unconcerned, explained that the upcoming full moon's tide would refloat them. He granted Aronnax, Ned, and Conseil permission to go ashore. They hunted local animals, including breadfruit, pigeons, a hog, and kangaroos, much to Ned's delight. However, they were discovered and attacked by Papuan natives. Returning to the *Nautilus*, they found Nemo calmly playing his organ. He dismissed their fears, stating the *Nautilus* was invulnerable. When the tide rose to refloat the vessel, the natives attempted to board. Nemo had electrified the handrails, repelling them with a powerful shock. The *Nautilus* then sailed away.

Continuing its journey, the *Nautilus* traversed the Indian Ocean, observing diverse marine life and even passing through a ""milk sea"" caused by luminous infusoria. They visited Ceylon's pearl fisheries, where Nemo displayed his courage by fighting off a gigantic shark that attacked an Indian pearl diver, saving the man and giving him a bag of pearls. Nemo revealed his charity was for ""oppressed races.""

The *Nautilus* then entered the Red Sea through the ""Arabian Tunnel,"" a natural subterranean passage beneath the Isthmus of Suez that Nemo had discovered and charted. He explained the geological and biological evidence for its existence. After a brief encounter with a submarine volcanic eruption near Santorin, they sped through the Mediterranean, reaching the Atlantic via the Straits of Gibraltar.

Ned Land, increasingly desperate for freedom, proposed an escape attempt that night as the *Nautilus* was near the Spanish coast. Aronnax, torn, agreed. However, Captain Nemo unexpectedly appeared, stopping the screw. He then gave Aronnax a detailed historical account of the 1702 Battle of Vigo Bay, where Spanish galleons laden with treasure were sunk. Nemo then revealed they were *in* Vigo Bay, and his crew, in diving suits, were harvesting gold and silver from the wrecks. He confessed his vast wealth was used to aid ""suffering beings and oppressed races.""

The *Nautilus* continued its journey, heading south, away from Europe. One night, Nemo invited Aronnax on an excursion to the bottom of the Atlantic. They walked among a petrified forest and, after climbing a submarine mountain, witnessed an active underwater volcano erupting lava. Below, Aronnax saw the ruins of a sunken city. Nemo, writing ""ATLANTIS"" on a basalt rock, revealed they were walking on the lost continent. Nemo appeared deeply affected by the historical site.

After replenishing sodium supplies from a submarine coal mine within an extinct volcano, the *Nautilus* entered the Sargasso Sea, a vast floating meadow of seaweed. They then headed towards the Antarctic Pole. Despite being blocked by an immense iceberg, Nemo was determined to reach the pole. He explained that the *Nautilus* could navigate under the ice by using its unique properties. After a violent deep dive through immense pressure, the *Nautilus* passed beneath the iceberg.

On March 21, 1868, at noon, Captain Nemo, after taking astronomical observations from a peak on a newly discovered Antarctic continent, declared he had reached the South Pole. He unfurled a black banner with a golden ""N,"" claiming the territory in his own name. He then bid farewell to the sun, which would now set for six months of polar night.

The *Nautilus* began its return journey, but was violently struck by a turning iceberg and became trapped at 180 fathoms deep, lying on its side. Nemo, acknowledging it as an ""accident,"" explained they were imprisoned in a tunnel of ice. He foresaw two dangers: being crushed or suffocated, as their air supply would last only two days. He ordered his crew, including Ned and Aronnax, to begin digging a trench in the ice to free the vessel. Aronnax noticed the ice walls were closing in due to water solidification. Nemo then ordered boiling water to be pumped out to prevent further freezing. After days of strenuous work and diminishing air, Aronnax and Conseil suffered from suffocation. Ned and Conseil selflessly gave Aronnax their remaining oxygen. On the sixth day, Nemo, as a last resort, caused the *Nautilus* to sink, using its weight and powerful screw as a battering ram to break through the remaining ice. The vessel burst free, and pure air rushed in.

Revived, they were on the surface, heading north. Ned Land renewed his determination to escape. The *Nautilus* passed Cape Horn and sailed up the Atlantic coast of South America, observing various marine species, including an electric cramp-fish that temporarily paralyzed Conseil. They saw manatees at the mouth of the Amazon.

In the Caribbean, Nemo became more reclusive. Aronnax and his companions, seven months into their imprisonment, discussed escape again. Ned, suffering from homesickness as they neared his native Canadian waters, pressured Aronnax to confront Nemo about their release. Aronnax visited Nemo's room, where Nemo was preparing a manuscript of his deep-sea studies, intending for it to be set adrift in a floating case by the last survivor. Nemo reiterated that whoever entered the *Nautilus* must never leave. Aronnax warned Nemo of Ned's desperate nature, but Nemo was unmoved, stating he guarded himself, not his prisoners.

The *Nautilus* then sailed into a hurricane off Long Island, near New York. Nemo, in an ""unaccountable caprice,"" braved the tempest on the surface, while Aronnax observed its immense power from the platform. The *Nautilus* proved resilient, but Aronnax saw a large vessel pass, struggling in the storm. Nemo eventually submerged for tranquility.

After the storm, the *Nautilus* drifted eastward. They observed the Atlantic cable on the seabed. On June 1, near the coast of Ireland, Nemo guided the *Nautilus* to the wreck of ""The Avenger,"" a French warship sunk heroically in 1794. He told its history with deep emotion, hinting at his profound hatred and desire for vengeance. A warship, an armored ram, was sighted approaching them, firing cannons. Aronnax realized this was an enemy, likely hunting the *Nautilus* as a known engine of destruction. Ned tried to signal the ship, but Nemo violently stopped him, unfurling a black flag with a golden ""N,"" and declared his intention to sink the vessel. He revealed that through this ""oppressor,"" he had lost his ""country, wife, children, father, and mother."" Aronnax, Ned, and Conseil were forced below. The *Nautilus* pursued the warship, then attacked it below the waterline, ramming it ""like a needle through sailcloth."" Through the saloon window, Aronnax watched in horror as the ship sank, its crew struggling in the water, before an explosion destroyed it, dragging all to the depths. Nemo, witnessing the ""hecatomb,"" returned to his room, where Aronnax saw him kneel before portraits of a young woman and two children, bursting into sobs.

The *Nautilus* then sped northward at a furious pace. Aronnax, horrified by Nemo's vengeance, lost all sense of time. Ned Land, at his breaking point, announced a final escape attempt that night. Aronnax agreed, determined to fly even if the sea swallowed them. At 9:30 PM, Aronnax heard Nemo playing his organ in the dark saloon. As Aronnax crept across the saloon to meet his companions, he heard Nemo murmur, ""Almighty God! enough! enough!"" in what seemed a confession of remorse.

Aronnax rushed to the boat, where Ned and Conseil were already loosening the bolts. Suddenly, loud shouts were heard from within the *Nautilus*: ""The maelstrom! the maelstrom!"" They realized they were on the dangerous coast of Norway, being drawn into the irresistible whirlpool. The *Nautilus* was caught in a spiraling current. As Ned struggled with the bolts, a crashing noise erupted, the bolts gave way, and their small boat was hurled into the maelstrom. Aronnax struck his head and lost consciousness.

Aronnax, Ned Land, and Conseil miraculously survived, waking in a fisherman's hut on the Loffoden Isles. Aronnax, unable to account for their escape, documented his incredible ten-month, 20,000-league voyage. He wondered about the *Nautilus*'s fate and Captain Nemo's survival, hoping that his hatred had been appeased and he would continue his peaceful exploration of the sea. Aronnax concluded that only he and Captain Nemo had the right to answer the ancient question, ""That which is far off and exceeding deep, who can find it out?"""
Ulysses-James Joyce,"The provided text, a portion of ""Ulysses,"" primarily details the events of a single day, June 16, 1904, following the perspectives of Stephen Dedalus and Leopold Bloom, and concluding with a lengthy internal monologue from Molly Bloom.

**Part I: Stephen Dedalus's Morning**

The day begins with Buck Mulligan, carrying a bowl of lather, emerging from the stairhead of a Martello tower. He intones Latin, then calls out to Stephen Dedalus, whom he refers to as ""Kinch"" and ""fearful jesuit."" Mulligan performs a mocking blessing of the tower and land. Stephen, displeased and sleepy, observes him coldly. Haines, a ""ponderous Saxon,"" is also present, staying with them. Stephen expresses unease about Haines, who was ""raving all night about a black panther."" Mulligan dismisses Haines and further teases Stephen about his ""absurd name,"" Malachi Mulligan.

Stephen confronts Mulligan about a past hurtful remark: Mulligan had called Stephen ""Dedalus whose mother is beastly dead"" after her passing. Mulligan dismisses the offense, claiming he's ""inconsequent."" Stephen, pained, reflects on his mother's death, her ""wasted body,"" and his refusal to kneel and pray for her on her deathbed. Mulligan then asks Stephen for a loan from his school earnings, which Stephen agrees to provide.

Mulligan and Haines prepare breakfast. Haines apologizes for waking them last night. The milkwoman arrives, and Mulligan flirts with her while Haines speaks Irish. Mulligan pays her, leaving a small debt of twopence. Haines praises Stephen's earlier remark that a ""cracked lookingglass of a servant"" is a ""symbol of Irish art."" Mulligan plans a swim, and Haines plans to visit the National Library.

Mulligan teases Stephen about his lack of personal hygiene. He then outlines a facetious theory of Hamlet, stating that ""Hamlet's grandson is Shakespeare's grandfather and that he himself is the ghost of his own father."" Mulligan then chants a blasphemous song about ""joking Jesus"" and runs off to swim.

Stephen and Haines discuss belief and Stephen identifies himself as a ""servant of two masters, an English and an Italian,"" and a third ""who wants me for odd jobs."" These are the ""imperial British state"" and the ""holy Roman catholic and apostolic church."" Mulligan, having swam, asks Stephen for the tower key and twopence for a pint, both of which Stephen provides. Stephen locks the tower, putting the key in his pocket. He reflects on his mother and his internal struggles.

**Part II: Leopold Bloom's Day**

**Bloom's Morning Rituals:** Mr. Leopold Bloom prepares breakfast for his wife, Molly. He enjoys inner organs of animals. He feeds the cat and speaks to Molly, who is still in bed. He goes to a pork butcher's to buy a kidney, encountering a shopgirl he admires. He reads an advertisement for ""Agendath Netaim,"" a planters' company in Palestine, imagining the landscape. He returns home and finds letters for Molly (from Blazes Boylan) and a letter and card for himself (from his daughter, Milly). He gives Molly her mail; she tucks Boylan's letter under her pillow. He cooks the kidney and reads Milly's letter, which mentions her birthday, her photography work, a picnic, and a student named Bannon who sings Boylan's song ""seaside girls."" Bloom reflects on Milly, Molly, and his own aging, feeling a ""soft qualm."" He then uses the outhouse, reading a story from ""Titbits"" and reflecting on his bodily functions.

**Bloom in the City:** Bloom walks through Dublin. At the post office, he picks up a letter addressed to ""Henry Flower."" He encounters C. P. M’Coy, who informs him of Paddy Dignam's death and funeral. Bloom mentions Molly's upcoming concert tour in Belfast. M’Coy asks Bloom to sign his name in the funeral book if he cannot attend. Bloom then reads Martha Clifford's letter to ""Henry Flower,"" which expresses longing, asks about his wife's perfume, and includes a pressed yellow flower. He crumples the envelope. He visits All Hallows church during mass, reflecting on religion, priests, and the money they make. He then goes to Sweny's chemist to order a skin lotion for Molly. There, he gives his newspaper (which he was about to discard) to Bantam Lyons, a man seeking horse racing tips. Lyons misinterprets Bloom's casual gesture as a tip.

**Dignam's Funeral:** Bloom joins Martin Cunningham, Mr. Power, and Simon Dedalus in a funeral carriage for Paddy Dignam. During the ride, Bloom realizes he still has the soap in his pocket. They pass Stephen, walking alone, and Simon Dedalus makes disparaging remarks about Stephen and Mulligan. The conversation turns to the deceased and the cost of funerals. Bloom reflects on his own dead son, Rudy, and Molly. They pass Blazes Boylan, and Bloom feels a pang of jealousy. When asked about Molly's concert tour, Bloom invents a trip to County Clare. They discuss a joke about Reuben J Dodd's son almost drowning. They reflect on Dignam's ""best death"" and then see a child's funeral. The topic of suicide arises, as Mr. Power's father poisoned himself. At the cemetery, Bloom changes the soap to another pocket. Inside the chapel, Father Coffey conducts the service, and Bloom observes, thinking about the Latin, the smell of corpses, and his own painful kneecap. At the graveside, John Henry Menton disparages Bloom to Ned Lambert, calling him ""Madame Marion Tweedy's"" husband and a ""traveller for blottingpaper."" Bloom is irked. The ""man in the macintosh,"" a mysterious figure, is seen and disappears. Hynes asks Bloom for his full name and to add M'Coy's name to the funeral list. Bloom does so. The coffin is lowered into the grave.

**Newspaper Office:** Bloom visits the *Freeman's Journal* office to place an advertisement for Alexander Keyes, a tea, wine, and spirit merchant. He meets Red Murray, Hynes, Professor MacHugh, J. J. O'Molloy, and Myles Crawford (the editor). Stephen Dedalus arrives with Mr. Deasy's letter about foot-and-mouth disease. There is a lengthy discussion about Roman and Irish history, art, and literature, during which Stephen presents his controversial theory that Shakespeare was the ghost in *Hamlet*, his own father, and that Ann Hathaway was unfaithful. Mulligan, entering late, mocks Stephen for being a ""sentimentalist"" and reveals Stephen's telegram (a request for money). Mulligan then makes a lewd joke about Bloom lusting after Aphrodite. Stephen suggests that paternity is a ""legal fiction"" and the only ""true thing"" is ""love of a mother."" Mulligan announces his intention to create a ""national fertilising farm"" on Lambay Island to combat sterility and shows his ""Fertiliser and Incubator"" card. Bloom leaves, having phoned about Keyes's ad, feeling dismissed by Crawford.

**Bloom at Davy Byrne's:** Bloom walks to Davy Byrne's pub. He orders a cheese sandwich and a glass of burgundy. Nosey Flynn, already there, asks about Molly's singing tour and mentions Blazes Boylan's involvement. A ""warm shock of air"" hits Bloom's heart. Davy Byrne states he never bets on horses. Bloom eats, reflecting on the wine and the strange things people eat. He recalls a past intimate moment with Molly on Howth Head. Nosey Flynn speculates that Bloom is a Freemason. Paddy Leonard and Bantam Lyons enter, discussing horse racing. Bantam Lyons says ""Throwaway"" (a long-shot outsider) won the Gold Cup. He whispers to Paddy Leonard that Bloom gave him the tip. Bloom leaves, feeling a ""weak joy.""

**The Viceregal Cavalcade and Dilly Dedalus:** Father Conmee travels through Dublin, making social calls and reflecting on various religious and personal matters. Katey and Boody Dedalus are at home, poor and hungry, waiting for their father. Blazes Boylan flirts with a shopgirl while arranging delivery of fruit to an ""invalid."" Almidano Artifoni advises Stephen to pursue music. Dilly Dedalus is seen loitering outside an auction house. She meets her father, Simon Dedalus, who gives her a shilling, but she knows he has more. Simon makes harsh remarks about his dead wife and suggests he wishes he were dead. He gives Dilly two pennies for milk and a bun. The Viceregal cavalcade passes through Dublin, observed by many characters, including Blazes Boylan (who flirts with the ladies), and a blind stripling.

**Ormond Hotel and Aftermath:** Miss Douce and Miss Kennedy, barmaids at the Ormond Hotel, are gossiping. Bloom walks by, reading ""Sweets of Sin"" and thinking of Martha. He sees Boylan's car and follows him into the Ormond dining room. Boylan orders drinks and makes a crude joke, then leaves to meet Molly. Ben Dollard, Simon Dedalus, and Father Cowley enter the saloon. Ben sings. Bloom writes a letter to Martha. Simon Dedalus sings ""M'appari."" Bloom is moved, thinking of Molly. Boylan leaves. The scene shifts to Barney Kiernan's pub, where the ""narrator"" (a third party) joins Joe Hynes and ""the citizen,"" a fiercely nationalistic figure with his dog, Garryowen. They discuss Irish politics, British injustices, and Bloom's perceived foreignness. Bloom is accused of being a ""perverted Jew."" Lenehan reveals Bloom won on ""Throwaway."" The citizen becomes enraged and throws a biscuit tin at Bloom, who is driving away in a car with Martin Cunningham and Jack Power. The narrative then shifts to an epic, fantastical account of Bloom's ascent to heaven as ""ben Bloom Elijah.""

**Nighttown (Brothel Scene):** Bloom arrives at the Mabbot Street entrance of ""nighttown,"" a red-light district, a place of squalor and strange encounters. He sees Cissy Caffrey singing a lewd song and Private Carr and Private Compton, two soldiers. Stephen Dedalus and Lynch pass, chanting Latin. Bloom is nearly hit by a tram and then by a sandstrewer. He buys pig's feet and a sheep's trotter. He encounters his deceased father, Rudolph, and mother, Ellen Bloom, who criticize his choices. Molly appears in Turkish attire, scornful. Zoe Higgins, a whore, finds a potato (Bloom's talisman) in his pocket and keeps it. Bloom envisions himself as Lord Mayor of Dublin, then a king. He is accused of various crimes by Mary Driscoll, Philip Beaufoy, Mrs Yelverton Barry, Mrs Bellingham, and Mrs Mervyn Talboys, who threaten him with violence. Paddy Dignam's ghost appears, speaking of metempsychosis and asking about his lost boot. Bloom enters Mrs. Cohen's brothel. Virag (Bloom's grandfather) appears as a lewd, pseudo-scientific commentator on women. Henry Flower (Bloom's alter ego) appears, playing a dulcimer. Stephen, in a rage, smashes a chandelier after his mother's ghost appears and reproaches him. Bloom pays Bella Cohen (the madam) for the damage. Stephen and Bloom attempt to leave. Bloom finds Stephen collapsed in the street and helps him.

**Part III: Return Home**

**The Walk Home:** Bloom and Stephen walk back to Eccles Street. They discuss music, literature, Ireland, and other topics. Bloom notes Stephen's weariness. Bloom realizes he's forgotten his latchkey again. He climbs over the area railings of his house, injures his head slightly, and enters through the kitchen. He lights a fire. Stephen enters quietly. Bloom prepares cocoa, giving Stephen the moustache cup, which was a gift from Milly. Bloom reflects on his own past, his early poetry, and the differences between him and Stephen (name, age, race, creed). He recalls anagrams of his name and an acrostic he sent Molly. He contemplates his inventions and advertising schemes, and his unfulfilled ambitions. He remembers his father's suicide. He reflects on his wife's ""deficient mental development"" and her ""proficiency of judgment regarding one person"" (himself). He also thinks about his attempts to educate her and his indirect methods of suggestion. He recounts his knowledge of famous Jewish figures and compares Irish and Hebrew linguistic features. They chant partially in Hebrew and Irish. Stephen signs his name in Irish and Roman characters. Stephen hears ""the accumulation of the past,"" and Bloom sees ""the predestination of a future.""

**A Tale of Two Moons:** Bloom invites Stephen to stay the night in his house. Stephen declines. Bloom returns Stephen's borrowed money (£1-7-0). They discuss other potential meeting places and their frustrations with past endeavors. Bloom contemplates the ""inevitable accidents"" and ""catastrophic cataclysms"" of human life, but despairs of finding solutions. Stephen affirms his significance as a ""conscious rational animal."" They exit the house. Bloom carries a candle, Stephen wears his hat. A cat enters. They look at the ""heaventree of stars,"" and Bloom meditates on cosmic and microscopic evolution. He reflects on the ""inhabitability of the planets"" and ""redemption."" He sees affinities between the moon and woman. They see the light from Molly's room. Bloom ""elucidates the mystery"" of Molly via the lamp. They urinate together in the garden, facing away from each other. They observe a shooting star. Bloom opens the door. The church bells chime the hour. Bloom hears ""retreating feet"" and a ""jew's harp,"" feeling the ""cold of interstellar space"" and ""proximate dawn."" He remembers deceased companions. He re-enters the house, hitting his head again on the sideboard.

**Bloom in Bed:** Inside, he finds the furniture rearranged. He notes the piano with music for ""Love's Old Sweet Song."" He lights an incense cone. He sees the mantelpiece items: a stopped clock, a dwarf tree, and an embalmed owl. He sees his own reflection, solitary and mutable, in the mirror. He then rights several inverted books on the shelves. He undresses, takes off his boots and socks, and picks and smells his toenail. He then compiles his daily budget, calculating his expenses and income. He envisions his ""ultimate ambition"" of owning a country house, detailing its features and his future life as a ""gentleman farmer"" and ""resident magistrate."" He considers various ""rapid but insecure means to opulence"" and ""schemes of wider scope."" He justifies these meditations as aiding sleep. He fears homicide or suicide during sleep. He reflects on a simple advertisement. He lists the contents of his first drawer (Milly's copybook, photographs, Martha's letters, erotic photocards, etc.) and his second drawer (birth certificate, insurance, bankbook, deedpoll for name change, his father's daguerreotype, haggadah book, his father's suicide note). He reflects on his father's death by poison and feels remorse for past disrespect of Jewish beliefs. He recalls his father's migrations and idiosyncrasies. He reduces himself to a ""negligible negative irrational unreal quantity"" without his financial protections. He reflects on reasons for ""departure"" and desirable locations. He imagines a public advertisement for his disappearance. He considers the inevitability of human suffering. He justifies his sentiments of envy, jealousy, abnegation, and equanimity regarding Molly's infidelity. He reflects on the ""preordained frangibility of the hymen"" and the ""futility of triumph."" He finds final satisfaction in the ""ubiquity"" of female anatomy. He experiences ""an approximate erection"" and kisses Molly's rump. He then replies to Molly's implied questions about his day, omitting certain events and including others, making Stephen Dedalus the ""salient point of his narration."" He reflects on his and Molly's ""limitations of activity and inhibitions of conjugal rights."" He notes Molly's repeated interrogations about his absences. He and Molly lie in bed, contemplating each other in silence, as the earth moves through space.

**Part III (Conclusion): Molly Bloom's Monologue**

Molly's internal monologue begins as she lies in bed, now awake. She reflects on Bloom's unusual request for breakfast in bed, a habit she associates with his attempts to manipulate old Mrs. Riordan for money. She criticizes Bloom's feigned illnesses and his general weakness, contrasting it with her own strength. She suspects he has been with other women, recalling his hidden letter (Martha's) and a ""long hair on his coat."" She remembers past jealousies and his ""pigheaded"" nature. She fantasizes about seducing a younger man and about the physical aspects of men. She recalls her own first sexual encounter with Lieutenant Mulvey in Gibraltar when she was fifteen, feeling a mix of wildness, fear, and desire. She remembers getting Bloom to propose on Howth Head by giving him a piece of seedcake from her mouth, during a leap year. She reflects on her life, her dreams, and her physical desires. She dismisses men's supposed intelligence and their need for women. She criticizes Bloom's lack of ambition and his odd hobbies. She thinks about her body, her breasts, and her monthly period, noting her own powerful sexuality. She plans to assert herself with Bloom, to make him realize she is still desirable despite her age. She ultimately reaffirms her belief in nature, love, and life, and concludes with a powerful ""yes,"" recalling her assent to Bloom's proposal on Howth Head."
