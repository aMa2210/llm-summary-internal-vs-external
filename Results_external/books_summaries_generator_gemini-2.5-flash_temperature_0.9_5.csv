A Doll_s House-Henrik Ibsen,"This detailed plot summary is based solely on the provided text of ""A Doll's House.""

**Act I**

The play opens on Christmas Eve in the comfortably furnished home of Nora and Torvald Helmer. Nora enters, humming happily, with Christmas parcels. She secretly eats macaroons, which her husband, Torvald, has forbidden. Torvald, who works as a lawyer, soon emerges from his study, playfully calling Nora his ""little lark"" and ""little squirrel"" and teasing her about being a ""spendthrift."" He gives her money for Christmas, though he cautions against excessive spending, emphasizing his strong belief that a home life should be free of debt and borrowing. Nora reveals that Torvald is about to become manager of the Bank after the New Year, which will bring them more financial security.

Nora's old school friend, Christine Linde, arrives, looking dejected. Nora initially struggles to recognize her due to her changed appearance. Christine reveals that she is a widow who has endured many years of hardship, working tirelessly to support her sick, bedridden mother and two younger brothers. Now that her mother has died and her brothers are self-sufficient, Christine feels ""unspeakably empty"" and seeks regular office work. Nora promises to speak to Torvald about getting Christine a position at the Bank.

Nora, eager to prove she is not just a ""child,"" confides a major secret to Christine. Years ago, when Torvald was gravely ill and doctors said he needed to go to Italy to recover, Nora secretly borrowed two hundred and fifty pounds. She did this because Torvald's principles forbade borrowing, and she couldn't bring herself to reveal the severity of his illness to him. She made everyone believe the money came from her dying father. Since then, she has been secretly working odd jobs like needlework and copying, and economizing from her household allowance (which Torvald believes she wastes) to pay back the quarterly interest and installments on the loan. She proudly states that she ""saved Torvald's life.""

During this conversation, Dr. Rank, a close family friend, arrives and goes to speak with Torvald. Shortly after, a lawyer named Krogstad also arrives to see Torvald on ""Bank business."" Mrs. Linde reacts with visible shock and fear upon seeing Krogstad, revealing she knew him years ago. Dr. Rank later comments on Krogstad, describing him as ""morally diseased"" and confirming he works at the Bank.

After Krogstad's meeting with Torvald, Krogstad confronts Nora. He reveals that Torvald intends to dismiss him from his post at the Bank and suggests that Mrs. Linde is being hired to take his place. He demands that Nora use her influence to persuade Torvald to keep him on. Nora denies having such influence. Krogstad then reveals he knows Nora's secret: the loan she took out for Torvald's recovery. He reminds her that she forged her father's signature on the bond, dating it three days after her father had actually died. Krogstad explains that he himself committed a similar ""indiscretion"" (forgery) in the past, which ruined his reputation, and he is desperate to reclaim his good name for his sons. He warns Nora that if he loses his position, she will lose hers with him, threatening to expose her secret to Torvald.

Nora is horrified but attempts to dismiss Krogstad's threats. When Torvald returns, Nora tries to hide Krogstad's visit. Torvald, however, immediately suspects Krogstad was there to plead for his job. He lectures Nora about Krogstad's moral corruption, particularly his forgery, stating that such ""an atmosphere of lies infects and poisons the whole life of a home"" and that almost everyone who has ""gone to the bad early in life has had a deceitful mother."" He explicitly forbids Nora from pleading Krogstad's cause, claiming he feels ""physically ill"" in the company of such dishonest people. Nora is left alone, terrified by Torvald's words, and pushes her children away, fearing she might ""deprave"" or ""poison"" them.

**Act II**

The next day, Christmas Day, Nora is visibly anxious, checking the letterbox for Krogstad's potential communication. She asks the Nurse if her children would forget her if she ""went away altogether,"" and inquires about the Nurse's own experience of leaving her child for work, a decision the Nurse states was necessary for her to take the position as Nora's nurse.

Mrs. Linde arrives to help Nora mend her Neapolitan fisher-girl costume for the upcoming fancy-dress ball. During their conversation, Nora reveals that Dr. Rank is suffering from a terminal spinal disease, inherited from his father's ""excesses,"" and will likely die soon. Mrs. Linde, suspecting that Dr. Rank might be the one who lent Nora the money, advises Nora to end her association with him. Nora vehemently denies Rank lent her the money, stating he had no funds at the time. She then admits she needs to ""make an end of it"" with ""the other one"" (Krogstad) behind Torvald's back.

Torvald returns, and Nora desperately tries to convince him to keep Krogstad employed, using affectionate pleas and promising to dance beautifully for him. Torvald refuses, reiterating Krogstad's moral failings and, more importantly, admitting that Krogstad's overly familiar address (""Helmer, old fellow"") makes him uncomfortable and would undermine his authority at the Bank. Despite Nora's frantic pleas, Torvald immediately dispatches a letter via the maid, dismissing Krogstad.

Overwhelmed, Nora cries out, but Torvald assures her that he is ""man enough to take everything upon myself"" if any trouble arises. Nora is briefly horrified by this statement, but quickly recovers, insisting he won't have to. He then urges her to practice her Tarantella, promising to help her and instructing her not to worry about anything until after the ball.

Dr. Rank arrives and, after some conversation, reveals to Nora that he has received ""absolute certainty"" of his impending death, which he describes as a consequence of his father's sins. He states he will send Nora a card with a black cross on it when the end is near and does not want Torvald in his sickroom, as Torvald dislikes anything ""ugly."" Nora, still contemplating seeking financial help, hints at needing a ""tremendously big favour"" from him. Misinterpreting her hints, Rank confesses his deep love for her and his willingness to sacrifice his life for her. Nora is shocked and repulsed by his declaration, rejecting his offer of help.

The maid then brings Nora Krogstad's card. Krogstad has come to the house through the back stairs. Nora quickly bolts Helmer's study door to prevent him from interfering and confronts Krogstad. Krogstad reveals he knows Torvald has dismissed him. He tells Nora he isn't going to accuse her but demands to be reinstated in a higher position at the Bank, as it is his chance to restore his reputation. He states he has a letter for Torvald detailing everything, and he will not take it back. He warns Nora that any desperate action on her part, such as running away or ""something worse,"" would be futile, as he would still have Torvald in his power. As Krogstad leaves, he drops the incriminating letter into the Helmers' locked letterbox.

Nora, in despair, shows Mrs. Linde the letter and confesses to forging her father's signature. She declares that ""a wonderful thing is going to happen!"" but also that it ""mustn't happen, not for all the world."" She asks Christine to be her witness that she alone committed the act, in case she goes ""out of her mind"" or ""anything else should happen to me."" Mrs. Linde, understanding Krogstad's motivations, rushes out to try and intercept Krogstad, believing she can talk him into retrieving the letter. Nora, desperate to buy time, tells Torvald she needs his help practicing the Tarantella and makes him promise not to open any letters until after the ball. She feels she has ""thirty-one hours to live"" until her secret is exposed.

**Act III**

Later that night, after the fancy-dress ball, Mrs. Linde is waiting for Krogstad in the Helmers' living room. When Krogstad arrives, she reveals her true reasons for breaking off their engagement years ago: she had to provide for her sick mother and brothers, and his future seemed bleak. Now that she is alone, she feels her life is ""unspeakably empty"" and proposes that they ""join forces,"" offering to be a mother to his children. Krogstad is deeply moved and overjoyed, feeling he can now ""clear myself in the eyes of the world."" He remembers the letter he sent to Helmer and offers to retrieve it. However, Mrs. Linde stops him, insisting that the ""unhappy secret must be disclosed"" so that Torvald and Nora can have ""a complete understanding between them,"" which is impossible with ongoing ""concealment and falsehood."" Krogstad agrees and leaves, expressing his profound happiness.

Torvald and Nora return from the ball. Torvald is flushed with excitement, praising Nora's dancing and beauty, and expressing his possessive desire for her. Nora, however, is tense and distant. Mrs. Linde says goodnight and leaves, having confirmed to Nora that she spoke to Krogstad and that Nora ""must tell your husband all about it."" Nora responds that she ""knew it"" and ""now I know what I must do.""

After Mrs. Linde leaves, Torvald tries to rekindle his intimacy with Nora, expressing his longing for her. Their conversation is interrupted by Dr. Rank, who has also returned from the ball. Rank, who has drunk too much, makes cryptic remarks about death and enjoyment. He reveals that he has sent his calling cards to the house, one of which has a black cross on it, signifying his impending death and his final farewell. He then leaves.

Torvald decides to clear the letterbox. Despite Nora's frantic attempts to stop him, he opens it. He finds Dr. Rank's cards with the black crosses, which Nora confirms is Rank's way of announcing he will soon ""shut himself up and die."" Torvald expresses sadness for Rank but quickly shifts to his own feelings, stating that Rank's death will bring him and Nora ""quite upon each other now."" He fantasizes about Nora being in danger so he could ""risk my life's blood, and everything, for your sake.""

Nora insists that Torvald read his letters. He retreats to his study. Moments later, he bursts out, holding Krogstad's letter. He is furious, calling Nora a ""miserable creature,"" ""hypocrite,"" ""liar,"" and ""criminal."" He denounces her actions as a reflection of her father's ""want of principle"" and declares she has ""destroyed all my happiness"" and ""ruined all my future,"" as Krogstad now has power over him. He states that he must maintain appearances, and while Nora will remain in his house, he will not allow her to raise the children, fearing she will corrupt them. He declares their happiness is over, and now only ""the remains, the fragments, the appearance"" matter.

Suddenly, the front doorbell rings. The maid brings in another letter for Nora. Torvald seizes it and reads it. His mood instantly shifts to one of overwhelming joy. Krogstad has sent back the bond and his letters, expressing regret and repentance due to ""a happy change in his life."" Torvald tears up all the incriminating papers and burns them, declaring, ""It’s all over! It’s all over! We are saved, Nora!"" He embraces Nora, assuring her he has forgiven her, knowing she acted ""out of love for me."" He calls her his ""womanly helplessness,"" his ""frightened little singing-bird,"" and promises to protect and guide her, stating that she has become ""both wife and child to him.""

Nora, however, has changed into her everyday dress. She calmly asks Torvald to sit down for a ""serious conversation,"" stating that for eight years, they have never truly talked. She reveals that she has never understood him, nor he her, and that their marriage has been like a ""playroom"" where she was his ""doll-wife,"" just as she was her father's ""doll-child."" She accuses him and her father of committing a ""great sin"" against her by preventing her from making anything of her life. She declares she has never been happy, only ""merry.""

Nora states that she must leave him to ""educate myself"" and understand herself as an individual. Torvald tries to forbid her, reminding her of her ""most sacred duties"" to her husband and children. Nora counters that she has ""other duties just as sacred""—duties to herself. She rejects the notion that she is primarily a wife and mother, asserting that she is, ""before all else,"" a ""reasonable human being"" who must learn to think for herself. She questions the law, which she finds ""foolish,"" for not allowing a daughter to spare her dying father anxiety or a wife to save her husband's life.

Torvald calls her ill and delirious, and accuses her of no longer loving him. Nora confirms that she does not. She explains that when the ""wonderful thing"" she had hoped for—his willingness to sacrifice his honor for her—did not happen, she realized he was not the man she thought he was. She saw that his fear was for his own reputation, not for her. She concludes that she has been living with a ""strange man"" for eight years.

Nora takes off her wedding ring, gives it back to Torvald, and asks for her own in return, declaring that there must be ""perfect freedom on both sides."" She states she will not see the children, believing they are in better hands. She rejects any offer of help or money from Torvald, calling him a ""stranger."" She states that the ""most wonderful thing of all"" would be for both of them to be so changed that their life together would be a ""real wedlock,"" but she no longer believes in wonderful things. She bids him goodbye and leaves the house, shutting the door behind her. Torvald sinks into a chair, calling her name, then looks around the empty room, a hope flashing across his mind: ""The most wonderful thing of all—?"" The sound of the outer door shutting echoes, signifying Nora's definitive departure."
Alice_s Adventures in Wonderland-Lewis Carroll,"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland begins with Alice sitting by her sister on a riverbank, feeling bored and sleepy. Her sister is reading a book without pictures or conversations, which Alice finds useless. Suddenly, a White Rabbit with pink eyes runs by, pulls a watch from its waistcoat-pocket, and exclaims, ""Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!"" Driven by curiosity, Alice follows the Rabbit down a large rabbit-hole without considering how she will get out.

The rabbit-hole plunges into a very deep well, allowing Alice ample time to observe her surroundings. She notices cupboards, bookshelves, maps, and pictures adorning the sides. She grabs a jar labelled ""ORANGE MARMALADE"" but finds it empty; she carefully places it in a cupboard to avoid hitting anyone below. As she continues to fall, she speculates about her depth and location, eventually growing sleepy and dozing off, dreaming of her cat, Dinah.

She suddenly lands on a heap of sticks and dry leaves, unhurt. She finds herself in a long, low hall, lit by lamps. All the doors are locked. She discovers a tiny golden key on a solid glass table. The key is too small for the large door locks, but then she spots a low curtain concealing a little door, about fifteen inches high. The golden key fits this lock. Alice opens the door and sees a beautiful garden but cannot fit through, wishing she could ""shut up like a telescope.""

Returning to the table, she finds a bottle labeled ""DRINK ME."" After prudently checking it's not marked ""poison,"" she tastes the delicious liquid (a mix of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast) and quickly finishes it. She immediately begins shrinking, becoming ten inches high – the perfect size for the small door. However, she realizes she left the golden key on the table, which is now too high to reach. She cries in frustration.

Her gaze falls on a small cake under the table, marked ""EAT ME."" She decides to eat it, hoping it will change her size again. After eating a bit, she remains the same size, which she finds dull given the day's unusual events. She finishes the cake.

Upon finishing the cake, Alice grows enormously, becoming over nine feet high, her head striking the hall's roof. She grabs the key but is now too large for the garden door. She sits down and weeps profusely, creating a large pool of tears that fills half the hall. The White Rabbit returns, splendidly dressed, carrying gloves and a fan, muttering about the Duchess. Alice tries to ask for help, but the Rabbit is startled, drops its items, and scurries away.

Alice picks up the fan and gloves. As she fans herself, she begins to shrink again, realizing the fan is the cause. She quickly drops it, narrowly avoiding disappearing entirely, and finds herself about two feet high. The little door is still shut, and the key is out of reach on the table. She slips and falls into the pool of tears she created, finding herself swimming among other creatures, including a Mouse.

She tries to converse with the Mouse, asking for directions out of the pool. When she attempts French (""Où est ma chatte?""), the Mouse is terrified. Alice apologizes, explaining she forgot it didn't like cats, then mentions her own cat, Dinah, which further offends the Mouse because Dinah catches mice. After Alice also mentions dogs, the Mouse, trembling with anger, agrees to tell its history only if they reach the shore. The pool becomes crowded with birds and animals that have fallen in (a Duck, a Dodo, a Lory, an Eaglet, etc.). Alice leads them to the bank.

On the bank, all the wet creatures discuss how to get dry. The Mouse, taking authority, attempts to dry them by reciting a dull history of William the Conqueror, which fails. The Dodo then proposes a ""Caucus-race,"" where everyone runs randomly until dry. After about half an hour, they are indeed dry, and the Dodo declares everyone has won and must have prizes. Alice provides a box of comfits as prizes for everyone. The Dodo, taking Alice's thimble, solemnly presents it back to her as her prize.

The Mouse then attempts to tell its ""long and a sad tale"" (a pun Alice misunderstands as referring to its tail's literal length and shape). The story is a poem about a trial between Fury and a mouse. Alice, distracted by the Mouse's tail, is not paying attention, which angers the Mouse. Alice tries to apologize, but the Mouse, easily offended, walks away when Alice misunderstands ""knot"" for ""not."" Alice calls after it, promising not to mention cats or dogs, but the Mouse refuses to return. Alice then mentions her cat, Dinah, and how good she is at catching mice and birds. This causes all the birds to flee in terror, leaving Alice alone and crying again.

The White Rabbit returns, searching frantically for his fan and gloves, fearing the Duchess. He mistakes Alice for his housemaid, Mary Ann, and orders her to fetch them from his house. Alice complies, finds the house (labeled ""W. RABBIT""), and goes inside. In a room, she finds the fan and gloves, along with an unlabeled bottle. She drinks from the bottle, hoping to grow, and indeed she does, quickly filling the entire room, with one arm out a window and one foot up the chimney.

The Rabbit returns, calling for Mary Ann. Unable to open the door due to Alice's size, he decides to enter through the window. Alice snatches at him through the window, causing a shriek and sounds of broken glass. The Rabbit then calls for ""Pat"" (a Lizard), ordering him to remove Alice's arm from the window. More broken glass sounds follow as Alice snatches again. The creatures outside decide to send Bill the Lizard down the chimney. Alice kicks her foot, sending Bill flying out. The Rabbit then proposes burning the house down, but Alice threatens to set her cat Dinah on them. They resort to throwing pebbles, which turn into cakes. Alice eats one, shrinks, and escapes the house.

Outside, she finds a crowd of animals, including Bill the Lizard, being revived by guinea-pigs. Alice runs into a thick wood, determined to return to her proper size and find the garden. She encounters an enormous puppy, which she distracts with a stick and then escapes from. She then finds a large mushroom. Peering over it, she sees a large blue Caterpillar smoking a hookah.

The Caterpillar asks Alice, ""Who are _you?_"" Alice explains her identity crisis due to constant size changes. The Caterpillar is unimpressed and dismisses her concerns. After a tense exchange, Alice grows irritated and tries to leave, but the Caterpillar calls her back, telling her to ""Keep your temper"" and promising ""something important."" It then tells her she is changed and asks her to recite ""You are old, Father William,"" which Alice does, but the words are altered into a nonsensical version. The Caterpillar criticizes her. When asked her desired size, Alice says she'd like to be a ""little larger"" than three inches, which offends the three-inch Caterpillar. The Caterpillar then crawls away, instructing her that ""One side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you grow shorter""—referring to the mushroom.

Alice breaks off a piece of mushroom from each side. She nibbles one piece and shrinks drastically, her chin hitting her foot. She then eats from the other piece and grows an incredibly long neck, resembling a serpent, rising above the trees. A Pigeon attacks her, screaming ""Serpent!"" and accusing her of hunting for eggs. Alice insists she is a ""little girl,"" but the Pigeon dismisses this, arguing that if girls eat eggs, they are a kind of serpent. Alice, annoyed, manages to eat from both mushroom pieces until she returns to her normal height. She then finds a tiny house (four feet high) and, recalling her past experiences, eats from the mushroom again to shrink to nine inches before approaching it.

At the tiny house, Alice witnesses a Fish-Footman deliver a croquet invitation from the Queen to a Frog-Footman for the Duchess. The Frog-Footman's nonsensical replies to Alice's questions about entering the house frustrate her. A plate flies out, narrowly missing the Footman's head. Alice, exasperated, opens the door and enters a smoky kitchen. Inside, the Duchess nurses a constantly sneezing and howling baby, while a Cook stirs peppery soup and a Cheshire Cat grins. Alice asks about the Cat's grin, learning it's a ""Cheshire cat."" The Cook begins throwing kitchenware at the Duchess and baby. The Duchess, after spouting confusing morals, flings the baby at Alice and leaves to play croquet.

Alice struggles to hold the oddly shaped, grunting baby. Outside, she realizes the baby's features are increasingly pig-like. Despite her warnings, the baby fully transforms into a pig. Alice sets it down, and it trots off into the wood. She then encounters the grinning Cheshire Cat again, sitting on a tree branch. Alice asks which way to go. The Cat says it depends on her destination, adding that everyone there is mad, including Alice, and points her towards the March Hare and the Hatter. The Cat then vanishes and reappears twice, eventually fading away completely, leaving only its grin floating in the air, which Alice finds most curious. She continues toward the March Hare's house, shrinking herself slightly with the mushroom to two feet tall as a precaution.

Alice arrives at the March Hare's house, finding the March Hare and the Hatter having a never-ending tea party with a sleeping Dormouse as a cushion. They claim ""No room!"" but Alice sits down indignantly. They offer wine (which doesn't exist) and then argue about politeness. The Hatter makes a personal remark about Alice's hair, then asks the riddle, ""Why is a raven like a writing-desk?"" but neither he nor the March Hare knows the answer. They engage in a nonsensical debate about language and time. The Hatter reveals they are stuck at perpetually tea-time (six o'clock) because the Queen of Hearts had him sentenced for ""murdering the time"" during a concert. They constantly move around the table for clean cups.

The March Hare suggests a story. The Dormouse, after being pinched awake, reluctantly tells a confusing story about three sisters living in a ""treacle-well"" and drawing ""treacle"" and other things beginning with ""M."" The Hatter and March Hare frequently interrupt Alice's questions and explanations. Alice becomes fed up with their rudeness and walks away in disgust, noting that they try to put the Dormouse into the teapot. She declares it the ""stupidest tea-party"" she's ever attended. She finds a door in a tree, enters it, and discovers she's back in the long hall. Using the golden key and the mushroom to adjust her size to about a foot high, she finally enters the beautiful garden.

In the garden, Alice finds three card gardeners painting white roses red, fearing the Queen's wrath for planting the wrong color tree. The Queen of Hearts arrives with a grand procession of card soldiers, courtiers, royal children, guests (including the White Rabbit), and the Knave of Hearts. Alice refuses to lie down like the gardeners. The Queen, discovering the gardeners' deception, orders their heads chopped off. Alice hides them in a flower-pot, and the soldiers, unable to find them, report that ""Their heads are gone."" The Queen then invites Alice to play croquet.

The croquet game is chaotic: the ground is uneven, the balls are live hedgehogs, the mallets are live flamingoes, and the arches are doubled-up soldiers who constantly move. The Queen, in a furious temper, repeatedly shouts ""Off with his head!"" or ""Off with her head!"" and sentences many players to execution, leaving only the King, Queen, and Alice not in custody. Alice, fearing for her own head, sees the grinning Cheshire Cat's head appear in the air. She talks to it, complaining about the game's unfairness. The King, disliking the Cat, orders its removal. The Queen echoes ""Off with his head!"" The executioner, the King, and the Queen argue about how to behead a head without a body, especially as the Cat's head begins to fade. Alice suggests asking the Duchess, who is fetched from prison. By the time the Duchess arrives, the Cat's head has completely vanished.

The Duchess joins Alice, linking arms and speaking in a much kinder tone, spouting various morals. The Queen reappears, angrily giving the Duchess a choice between her head and leaving. The Duchess vanishes instantly. The Queen, out of breath from ordering so many executions, asks Alice if she's seen the Mock Turtle. The King, meanwhile, secretly pardons all the imprisoned guests. The Queen sends Alice with a Gryphon to find the Mock Turtle and hear its story. The Gryphon assures Alice that the Queen's execution threats are just ""fancy"" and that ""they never executes nobody.""

They find the Mock Turtle, sighing sadly. It begins its story by revealing, ""Once... I was a real Turtle,"" then dissolves into sobs. After some time, it continues, describing its schooling in the sea, learning ""Reeling and Writhing,"" ""Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, and Derision,"" and ""Drawling, Stretching, and Fainting in Coils."" The Gryphon adds that he learned ""Laughing and Grief."" Alice asks about their lesson schedule, learning they lessen each day. The Gryphon interrupts, suggesting they talk about games instead of lessons.

The Mock Turtle describes the ""Lobster Quadrille,"" a dance involving lobsters as partners, throwing them out to sea, and somersaults. The Mock Turtle and Gryphon then demonstrate parts of the dance around Alice, singing a song about a whiting and a snail. Alice enjoys the song but is puzzled by the explanation of why whitings have their tails in their mouths (they fell from the sky with lobsters). The Gryphon further explains that ""whiting"" also refers to something that ""does the boots and shoes"" under the sea, made of ""soles and eels."" Alice begins to tell them her own adventures, starting from seeing the White Rabbit. When she recounts her changed recitation of ""Father William"" for the Caterpillar, the Mock Turtle is intrigued and asks her to repeat another poem. Alice recites ""’Tis the voice of the Lobster,"" but the words are nonsensical. The Mock Turtle demands an explanation, but the Gryphon tells Alice to stop. The Mock Turtle then begins to sing ""Turtle Soup,"" a song praising ""Beautiful Soup.""

As the Mock Turtle sings, a cry of ""The trial’s beginning!"" is heard. The Gryphon immediately pulls Alice away, rushing her to the trial, leaving the song unfinished.

Alice and the Gryphon arrive at the trial of the Knave of Hearts, accused of stealing the Queen's tarts. The King and Queen are on their throne, the Knave is in chains, and the White Rabbit serves as the herald. Alice identifies the King as the judge and twelve assorted creatures as the jury, who are busily writing their names on slates to avoid forgetting them. Alice calls them ""Stupid things!"" and subtly removes Bill the Lizard's squeaky pencil. The White Rabbit reads the accusation: a poem about the Knave stealing the Queen's tarts.

The first witness is the Hatter, who arrives with a teacup and bread-and-butter, claiming he hadn't finished tea. His testimony is rambling and nonsensical, involving the March Hare and Dormouse, and he is accused by the King of having ""stolen"" his hat (which he merely sells). Alice notices she is growing larger again, causing the Dormouse, seated next to her, to complain. The Queen glares at the Hatter, and the King threatens him with execution. The Hatter continues his confused testimony, denying or forgetting details, and is eventually dismissed. A guinea-pig is suppressed for cheering. The Queen orders the Hatter's head chopped off outside, but he escapes.

The second witness is the Duchess's Cook, who carries a pepper-box, causing everyone to sneeze. She refuses to give evidence. The King cross-examines her, asking what tarts are made of, and she replies ""Pepper, mostly."" The Dormouse pipes up, saying ""Treacle,"" leading to a chaotic attempt by the Queen to have the Dormouse beheaded and suppressed. During the confusion, the Cook disappears. The King, relieved, calls for the next witness.

The White Rabbit announces the next witness is ""Alice!"" Alice, forgetting her size, jumps up, knocking over the jury-box and scattering the jurymen. She hastily puts them back, correcting Bill the Lizard who was placed head-down. The King asks what she knows about the business; Alice replies ""Nothing."" The King initially calls this ""important,"" but the White Rabbit corrects him to ""unimportant."" The King then reads ""Rule Forty-two. _All persons more than a mile high to leave the court_."" Everyone looks at Alice, who is now very tall. She refuses to leave, arguing it's not a real rule and was just invented.

The White Rabbit then produces a paper, a set of unsigned verses, found on the prisoner. The King, assuming mischief, declares it proves the Knave's guilt. Alice, now very large and fearless, declares there's ""not an atom of meaning in it."" The King attempts to interpret the nonsensical poem, trying to link lines to the Knave's actions and the Queen's history (leading to the Queen throwing an inkstand at Bill the Lizard). The King makes a pun, and the court laughs. The Queen demands ""Sentence first—verdict afterwards!"" Alice vehemently rejects this, calling it ""Stuff and nonsense!"" The Queen, enraged, shouts ""Off with her head!""

Alice, now at her full size, defiantly declares, ""Who cares for you? You're nothing but a pack of cards!"" At this, the entire pack of cards rises into the air and flies down upon her. Alice screams, half in fright and half in anger, and tries to beat them off.

She then wakes up, finding herself lying on the riverbank with her head in her sister's lap. Her sister is gently brushing dead leaves from her face. Alice tells her sister about her ""curious dream."" Her sister, after hearing the tale, closes her eyes and imagines Alice's adventures, seeing the White Rabbit, the Mouse, the tea party, the Queen, the pig-baby, the Gryphon, the Lizard's pencil, and the Mock Turtle. She then envisions Alice as a grown woman, sharing these wonderful stories with other children, cherishing the simple joys and sorrows of childhood and her happy summer days."
Anna Karenina-Leo Tolstoy,"The provided text, ""Anna Karenina,"" unfolds the intertwined lives of several aristocratic Russian families, primarily focusing on the marital crises of Dolly Oblonskaya and Anna Karenina, and the spiritual journey of Konstantin Levin.

**Part One**

The narrative begins amidst the disarray of the Oblonskys' Moscow household. Darya Alexandrovna (Dolly), the wife, has discovered her husband, Stepan Arkadyevitch Oblonsky (Stiva), is having an affair with their French governess. Dolly declared she could no longer live with him, leading to three days of emotional turmoil affecting the entire household. Stiva wakes up in his study, plagued by guilt and the memory of Dolly's fury upon finding the incriminating letter. He laments his ""idiotic smile"" during the confrontation. He rationalizes his infidelity, believing Dolly, a ""worn-out woman,"" should have been more indulgent. Matvey, Stiva's valet, informs him that his sister, Anna Arkadyevna, is arriving from Petersburg, suggesting she might mediate a reconciliation. Dolly, however, remains firm in her decision to leave, much to Stiva's dismay. The nurse, Matrona Philimonovna, urges Stiva to beg for forgiveness.

Stiva attends to his official duties and personal finances, finding an unpleasant issue with selling his wife's forest property. He also spends time with his children, Grisha and Tanya, noting Tanya's discomfort with the family's situation. He then decides to confront Dolly again. In her room, Dolly is packing but feels trapped by her love for Stiva and concern for her five children. Stiva's attempt to reconcile is met with Dolly's renewed rage, especially when he mentions his ""instant of passion."" She calls him ""loathsome"" and ""repulsive,"" threatening to expose him publicly. A child's cry momentarily softens her, but she leaves the room, still resolute. Stiva is left feeling the ""vulgarity"" of the situation. Dolly, though still contemplating leaving, recognizes the impossibility of it and returns to her daily responsibilities.

Meanwhile, Konstantin Dmitrievitch Levin, an old friend of Stiva's, arrives in Moscow. His true purpose is to propose to Kitty Shtcherbatskaya, Dolly's younger sister, whom he views as an idealized, perfect being. Levin feels unworthy due to his life as a country gentleman. He visits his half-brother, Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev, a philosopher, finding their intellectual discussions abstract and unfulfilling. Sergey Ivanovitch reveals their estranged elder brother, Nikolay, is in Moscow, and advises against seeing him. Levin, however, decides to visit Nikolay later. At the Zoological Gardens, Levin finds Kitty skating and is captivated by her. They skate together, holding hands, but Kitty's demeanor shifts, making Levin feel he has offended her. Kitty's mother invites Levin to their home. Levin leaves with Stiva, overjoyed yet uneasy.

At a restaurant, Oblonsky discusses Kitty with Levin, revealing Dolly's ""foreseeing"" belief that Kitty will marry Levin, which delights Levin. Levin confesses his past sins and feeling unworthy. Oblonsky mentions Count Vronsky as a rival for Kitty's affections, causing Levin anger and gloom. Oblonsky then confides in Levin about his own affair, defending his actions as part of life's ""light and shadow."" Levin, disgusted by Oblonsky's casual view of infidelity, resolves to propose to Kitty.

Kitty, caught between Levin and Vronsky, feels immense pressure. Her mother favors Vronsky, a wealthy and charming officer, over Levin. Kitty had refused Levin once, believing Vronsky had serious intentions. At the evening party, Levin proposes to Kitty, who, recalling Vronsky, hastily refuses him. Vronsky arrives, and Levin, witnessing Kitty's bright eyes when she looks at Vronsky, confirms his suspicions of her love. The old Prince Shtcherbatsky, Kitty's father, openly favors Levin but is cold to Vronsky. Levin leaves in despair.

Kitty tells her mother about Levin's proposal and her refusal, but is plagued by doubts and remorse for hurting him. Her parents argue, the Prince vehemently condemning the Princess for encouraging Vronsky, whom he suspects is merely flirting.

Vronsky, unaware of the family's turmoil, is exhilarated by his growing connection with Kitty. He sees marriage as ""ridiculous"" but feels a ""secret spiritual bond"" with Kitty. The next morning, at the Petersburg railway station, Vronsky meets Oblonsky, who is there to meet his sister, Anna Karenina. Oblonsky, unaware of Anna's confession to her husband, mentions Levin's rejected proposal to Kitty, implying Vronsky has a clear path. Vronsky feels like a ""conqueror."" A railway guard is crushed by a train; Anna, observing the accident, calls it an ""omen of evil."" Vronsky quietly donates money to the widow. Anna's initial meeting with Vronsky is marked by mutual fascination.

**Part Two**

Kitty's health declines, and doctors recommend a trip abroad to Soden. Her father blames the Princess for pushing Kitty toward Vronsky, causing Kitty immense shame and misery. Dolly visits, sharing her own marital woes, and reproaches Kitty for her outburst, but later understands her sister's suffering. Kitty confesses her deep unhappiness, her feeling that everything is ""hateful, loathsome, coarse,"" and her ""sham"" attempts at charity work. She decides to stay with Dolly to help with her children, who have scarlet fever, before going abroad with her parents.

In Petersburg, Anna immerses herself in fashionable society, particularly with Princess Betsy Tverskaya. She realizes Vronsky's pursuit has become the ""whole interest of her life."" Vronsky, after mediating a scandal involving his friends, tells Betsy he is now fully ""caught"" by Anna. Anna confronts Vronsky about his past behavior toward Kitty, telling him to seek Kitty's forgiveness. Vronsky, in turn, passionately declares his love for Anna, stating she is his ""whole life."" Alexey Alexandrovitch enters Betsy's party and makes sarcastic remarks. Vronsky whispers to Anna that he will not change anything in their relationship for now. Anna later confesses to Alexey Alexandrovitch her love for Vronsky, feeling a sense of ""shame, rapture, and horror"" at this new life. She is haunted by a dream of both men being her husbands.

Alexey Alexandrovitch, deeply disturbed by Anna's confession, initially experiences relief, feeling like a ""tooth had been pulled."" He views Anna as ""corrupt"" and resolves to end their marriage while preserving his honor and punishing her. He considers dueling and divorce but rejects them for various reasons, including fear of scandal and the impact on Seryozha. He decides to keep Anna with him, demanding external propriety and the cessation of her affair, hoping for her ""reformation."" He formalizes this decision in a cold letter to Anna, enclosing money and ordering her return to Petersburg. Anna is horrified by his ""base"" generosity, interpreting it as a calculated move to control and torment her. She briefly considers running away with Seryozha but despairs, realizing her lack of strength to break from her old life. She sends a non-committal reply to her husband.

Vronsky, meanwhile, struggles with the implications of Anna's pregnancy, which complicates his established code of principles. He considers leaving the army but is pulled by ambition, inflamed by the success of his former rival, Serpuhovskoy. He is now consumed by ""disgrace, humiliation, guilty"" feelings towards Alexey Alexandrovitch's magnanimity. In a moment of despair, Vronsky attempts suicide with a revolver but only wounds himself. His brother's wife, Varya, nurses him. Alexey Alexandrovitch, transformed by his act of forgiveness during Anna's confinement, feels a profound spiritual peace and develops a tender attachment to Anna's newborn daughter, Annie. He sees his previous indifference to religion replaced by an ardent faith, guided by Countess Lidia Ivanovna. He is unaware of the social mockery he faces. Anna, still in Petersburg, is distressed by Vronsky's perceived coldness and the social ostracism she faces. Lidia Ivanovna actively prevents Anna from seeing Seryozha, believing Anna is a ""bad woman"" and that Alexey Alexandrovitch's new spiritual path must be protected.

Anna, desperate to see her son, attempts to visit him on his birthday, bribing servants to gain entry. She finds Seryozha, who recognizes and embraces her, despite his father's attempts to make him forget her. Seryozha expresses his love for her, but Anna, seeing the ""dread and something like shame"" in his face, realizes she must leave him. She tells him to love his father, who is ""better and kinder."" Alexey Alexandrovitch enters, and Anna, filled with ""repulsion and hatred,"" quickly departs, leaving behind the toys she bought for Seryozha. Back at her hotel, Anna is consumed by despair, finding her love for her baby girl insufficient compared to her longing for Seryozha. She fears Vronsky's love is waning and confronts him. Their argument intensifies, with Anna accusing him of coldness and indifference. She speaks of her dream of dying in childbirth. Vronsky, horrified, reassures her of his love. He declines a prestigious appointment in Tashkend and retires from the army, committing to Anna. They leave for Italy without obtaining a divorce.

**Part Three**

Levin, now married to Kitty, is initially overwhelmed by the ""pettiest details"" of married life, which clashes with his idealized expectations. He and Kitty experience frequent quarrels, often stemming from misunderstanding and his jealousy. He is particularly vexed by her domestic preoccupations, but comes to admire her strength. After an argument where Kitty accuses him of not loving her, he realizes they are inextricably linked. Their honeymoon period is described as ""bitterest and most humiliating.""

They return to the country. Levin receives a letter from Marya Nikolaevna, his brother Nikolay's former mistress, stating Nikolay is dying and needs help. Kitty insists on accompanying Levin, causing another argument about her perceived weakness and his desire to travel alone. They reconcile, and both go to Nikolay's provincial hotel. Levin is horrified by Nikolay's emaciated appearance, but Kitty, with practical compassion, immediately takes charge, cleaning the room and caring for Nikolay. Levin is deeply moved by Kitty's unwavering love and strength. Nikolay dies after receiving extreme unction, murmuring ""Right! ... O Lord!"" Levin is overwhelmed by the mystery of death, but Kitty's presence and her pregnancy bring him back to life and love.

Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev visits Levin in the country, but Levin feels uncomfortable with his brother's detached, intellectual view of rural life and peasants. Levin is still struggling with his own farming methods and his inability to find meaning in public service. He is stung by Sergey Ivanovitch's criticisms of his indifference. During a day of mowing with the peasants, Levin finds profound satisfaction in physical labor and observes the simple, unquestioning faith of an old peasant, Fokanitch, who lives ""for his soul, in truth, in God’s way."" This sparks an epiphany in Levin: true meaning and goodness are intuitive and God-given, not discoverable by reason. He embraces faith, feeling a ""spiritual peace"" and ""positive meaning of goodness"" in his life, despite his lingering intellectual doubts and human flaws.

Levin is called home from the fields to meet Sergey Ivanovitch and Katavasov. Dolly tells him Vronsky is going to Servia. Levin and his guests debate the Servian War. Levin argues against private citizens engaging in war and murder, advocating for the ""soul"" over vengeance, but feels defeated by his brother's and Katavasov's intellectual arguments. A storm breaks, and Levin, fearing for Kitty and their son, Mitya, rushes to find them, relieved they are safe. He attends Mitya's bath, feeling a growing love for his child, though initially disappointed by his own paternal feelings. He sits on the terrace, reflecting on his intuitive faith, and resolves to keep it a personal secret.

**Part Four**

Alexey Alexandrovitch, after Anna's departure, is left alone with Seryozha in Petersburg. He is overcome by despair and humiliation, feeling abandoned and despised by society. Countess Lidia Ivanovna offers him moral and spiritual support, encouraging his new, mystical Christian faith. He finds solace in this ""delusion of salvation,"" which allows him to dismiss his worldly troubles. Lidia Ivanovna, devoted to Alexey Alexandrovitch, intercepts a letter from Anna asking to see Seryozha, refusing Anna's request in a harsh letter. Seryozha, meanwhile, struggles with his father's new strict religious education and his mother's absence. He secretly searches for his mother, disbelieving she is wicked.

**Part Five**

Levin and Kitty are married. Levin, in a state of ecstatic happiness, is overwhelmed by the wedding preparations and his own confession of past impurity and unbelief to Kitty. Kitty, though pained by his confession of impurity, forgives him. They move to the country. Levin is initially disappointed by Kitty's domestic focus and their frequent quarrels, but he learns to appreciate her practical love. He is still wrestling with his new spiritual insights and the meaning of life, which he contrasts with the simple, unquestioning faith of the peasants. During his stay in Moscow, Levin again feels the pressure of social expectations and the emptiness of intellectual debates.

**Part Six**

Dolly and her children visit the Levins in the country. Kitty, now pregnant, thrives in her role as mistress of the house. Sergey Ivanovitch, having experienced the failure of his scholarly book, now dedicates himself to the ""Slavonic question"" (the Servian War), seeing it as a manifestation of the people's will. During a mushroom-picking excursion, Sergey Ivanovitch almost proposes to Varenka, but hesitates, unable to overcome his loyalty to his deceased love. Kitty is disappointed by this missed opportunity.

Stepan Arkadyevitch arrives with Vassenka Veslovsky, a charming but flirtatious young man. Levin becomes intensely jealous of Veslovsky's attention to Kitty. In a fit of rage, Levin confronts Kitty, accusing her of encouraging Veslovsky. Kitty, though initially offended, is touched by his deep love and reassures him. Levin, still furious, orders Veslovsky to leave. Stepan Arkadyevitch is dismayed by Levin's ""ridiculous"" jealousy, but Levin remains firm. Dolly visits Anna in the country, experiencing the luxury and cultivated atmosphere of her new life with Vronsky. Dolly is conflicted; she admires Anna's happiness but feels uncomfortable with the moral implications of her situation. Anna confesses her anxieties about Vronsky's waning love and her desperate desire for a divorce to legitimize their relationship and their daughter, Annie. She also reveals her inability to have more children. Dolly, though sympathetic, is horrified by these revelations.

**Part Seven**

Levin and Kitty are in Moscow, awaiting Kitty's overdue confinement. Levin feels restless and out of place in the city, missing his purposeful country life. He has money troubles. He meets Kitty's sister, Natalia, and her husband, Lvov, who discusses the challenges of raising children and the importance of religion. Levin is impressed by Lvov's sincerity. He attends a concert, finding the new music confusing, and makes an awkward social call. At the club, Levin is reconciled with Vronsky, finding a surprising ease in his company. Stepan Arkadyevitch urges Levin to visit Anna, who is in Moscow awaiting her divorce. Levin visits Anna, who captivates him with her intelligence and charm. Anna confides in Levin about her difficult position and her struggle for a divorce. Levin, though still judging her, feels tenderness and pity.

Kitty becomes jealous of Levin's visit to Anna, accusing him of loving Anna. Levin soothes her by confessing his pity for Anna and his own struggles with Moscow life. Anna, meanwhile, is plagued by Vronsky's perceived coldness and his continued delays in arranging a divorce. She confronts him, leading to a bitter argument. She suggests her impending death as a release. Vronsky, horrified, reassures her of his love and agrees to leave Moscow with her.

Kitty's labor begins, filling Levin with terror. He prays desperately for her safety, experiencing a profound spiritual awakening. After an agonizing twenty-two hours, Kitty gives birth to a healthy boy, Mitya. Levin is overcome with joy, realizing his love and faith have saved him from despair. He still struggles with the abstractness of his new faith, but accepts it as an intuitive, inexpressible truth.

Stepan Arkadyevitch, facing financial ruin, goes to Petersburg to secure a new, lucrative government post and to press Alexey Alexandrovitch for Anna's divorce. He meets with Alexey Alexandrovitch, who, under the influence of Countess Lidia Ivanovna and the clairvoyant Landau, refuses the divorce, citing Christian principles and his responsibility to Seryozha. Seryozha, meanwhile, continues to struggle with his separation from his mother, repressing his memories of her.

Anna, after her son's birthday visit, is increasingly desperate. She feels Vronsky's love waning, and her jealousy intensifies. After a bitter quarrel, she believes Vronsky hates her and loves another. She contemplates suicide as a way to punish him and regain his love. After sending a desperate note to Vronsky, who is away, she travels to the railway station. Overwhelmed by despair and remembering the man crushed by a train, she throws herself under the wheels, dying instantly.

**Part Eight**

Sergey Ivanovitch's scholarly book is a failure. He channels his energy into the Servian War, seeing it as a great national cause. He and Katavasov travel to the country, encountering volunteers for the war. Countess Vronskaya, seeing Vronsky off to Servia, blames Anna for ruining her son and describes Vronsky's despair and suicide attempt after Anna's death. She sees the war as a ""providential blessing"" for him. Vronsky, looking ""aged and worn by suffering,"" confesses to Sergey Ivanovitch that life is ""worth nothing"" to him and he is glad to have a cause to die for. He is haunted by the memory of Anna's body at the station.

Levin, at home, is told about Vronsky's departure. He debates the war with Sergey Ivanovitch and the old prince, arguing against private involvement in murder. He maintains that true good comes from living ""for one's soul,"" not from abstract political causes. He feels defeated in argument but remains firm in his intuitive faith. A storm brings a moment of fear for Kitty and Mitya, reinforcing Levin's focus on love and family. He reflects on his newfound faith, concluding that while he will continue to struggle with life's imperfections, his spiritual strength is ""untouched,"" and his life now holds a ""positive meaning of goodness."" He embraces this personal, inexpressible faith, understanding that it provides the ultimate answer to life's meaning."
Crime and Punishment-Fyodor Dostoyevsky,"Raskolnikov, a handsome but impoverished former student, lives in a cramped garret in S. Place, deeply in debt to his landlady. He avoids her due to his debts and his own irritable, hypochondriac state, which has led him to isolate himself. He harbors a secret plan, which he initially dismisses as a fantasy, but now, a month later, views as an impending ""exploit.""

On a hot July evening, Raskolnikov sets out for a ""rehearsal"" of his plan. He walks to a large house, carefully avoiding detection, and ascends to the fourth floor where an old pawnbroker, Alyona Ivanovna, lives. He notes that a German clerk is moving out of the adjoining flat, leaving the old woman alone. He rings her bell. Alyona, a sixty-year-old, withered woman with suspicious eyes, opens the door cautiously. Raskolnikov, introducing himself as a former client, presents an old silver watch to pawn. Alyona reminds him that his previous pledge is overdue and offers a meager sum for the watch. Raskolnikov, angered but having ""another object"" in mind, takes the money. He then tries to ascertain if Alyona's sister, Lizaveta, is always home with her. As he leaves, he feels intense repulsion for the ""atrocious thing"" he contemplates. He stops at a tavern, drinks beer, and feels his thoughts clear.

In the tavern, he encounters a drunken former government clerk, Marmeladov, who engages him in a rambling monologue. Marmeladov describes his crushing poverty and the shame of his beggary, contrasting it with his proud, educated wife, Katerina Ivanovna, an officer's daughter. He confesses to selling his wife’s belongings for drink, leaving her and their three small children in destitution, and how his daughter from his first marriage, Sonia, has been forced into prostitution (""yellow ticket"") to support the family. He recounts a poignant scene where Sonia silently placed her earnings on the table, and Katerina Ivanovna knelt and kissed her feet. Marmeladov then admits to stealing his remaining earnings five days prior and spending them on drink, leaving his family to starve. He confesses he obtained the drink he is currently consuming from Sonia, who gave him her last thirty copecks. Marmeladov, in despair, declares he should be crucified, not pitied, and speaks of God's eventual forgiveness for Sonia. He asks Raskolnikov to accompany him home.

They arrive at Katerina Ivanovna’s squalid room. Katerina Ivanovna, emaciated and coughing blood, is enraged to find Marmeladov drunk and without money. She drags him by his hair, while he calls it ""consolation."" The children are terrified. Katerina Ivanovna turns on Raskolnikov, accusing him of drinking with her husband. As Raskolnikov leaves, he places a small amount of money (coppers) on the window unnoticed. He debates taking it back, then dismisses it. He reflects on the ""vileness"" of man and his own dark thoughts.

The next morning, Raskolnikov wakes from a troubled sleep in his dilapidated room. Nastasya, his landlady’s servant, informs him that his landlady, Praskovya Pavlovna, plans to report him to the police for unpaid rent. He also receives a letter from his mother. The letter details his sister Dounia's recent ordeal as a governess, where her employer, Mr. Svidrigaïlov, made indecent proposals. Dounia was unjustly accused and humiliated by Svidrigaïlov's wife, Marfa Petrovna, but was later publicly vindicated when Svidrigaïlov provided proof of her innocence. The letter also announces Dounia's engagement to Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin, a wealthy, forty-five-year-old counsellor, who, despite some rude remarks about marrying a poor woman to be her benefactor, is seen as a means to secure Raskolnikov's future and enable him to finish his studies. His mother and Dounia are coming to Petersburg soon.

Raskolnikov, enraged by the letter, views the marriage as a sacrifice for his sake and vows it ""shall not be."" He feels both pity and hatred for his family. He despises Luzhin. He then has a vivid dream of his childhood, witnessing a drunken peasant, Mikolka, brutally beating a weak old mare to death. He wakes in terror, realizing the dream mirrors his own murderous impulses. He again dismisses his dark plan as ""base, loathsome, vile."" However, later in the Hay Market, he overhears Lizaveta, the pawnbroker's sister, arranging to be away from home the next day at seven o'clock, leaving Alyona Ivanovna alone. This information, a ""predestined turning-point,"" solidifies his resolve. He remembers an earlier tavern conversation where a student casually discussed the idea of killing the ""useless"" old pawnbroker for the greater good.

On the day of the murder, Raskolnikov, in a feverish state, prepares a fake ""pledge"" (a piece of wood with metal) and a noose to conceal an axe. He creeps downstairs to steal an axe from his landlady's kitchen but finds Nastasya there. Crushed, he almost gives up but then spots an axe in the porter's open room, takes it, and conceals it. He reaches Alyona Ivanovna's flat around seven. He rings the bell, his heart pounding. Alyona, suspicious, opens the door slightly. Raskolnikov pushes his way in and, as she examines the fake pledge with her back to him, strikes her head repeatedly with the blunt side of the axe, killing her. He takes her keys and finds a large strong-box under her bed, filled with gold and jewels. As he is stuffing his pockets, Lizaveta unexpectedly enters. Frozen in terror, she does not scream. Raskolnikov, in a panic, strikes her with the sharp edge of the axe, killing her instantly.

Overwhelmed by fear and loathing, he washes his hands and the axe in the kitchen. He is shocked to find the main door to the staircase wide open. He hears footsteps approaching and slips into an empty flat on the second floor where painters had been working. The approaching men (Koch and a student) stop at the old woman's door, realizing it is only hooked from the inside, meaning someone is home. They go to fetch the porter. Raskolnikov slips out and escapes. Disoriented, he hides the stolen items under a stone in a deserted courtyard. He feels a momentary triumph, then a terrible sickness and repulsion.

He then receives a police summons for an unpaid IOU. At the police station, he faints, but is relieved to find the summons is only for debt, not the murder. While there, he overhears police discussing the murder of Alyona Ivanovna and Lizaveta. He realizes they suspect the painter, Nikolay, who had tried to hang himself and confessed. Raskolnikov, in his delirium, admits to Razumihin that he has been thinking about the murder and speaks of hidden jewelry. Razumihin purchases new clothes for Raskolnikov with money sent by his mother, and tears up the IOU.

Svidrigaïlov, Dounia's former employer, visits Raskolnikov, revealing he knows Raskolnikov's secret and that Marfa Petrovna left Dounia three thousand roubles in her will. He states he has come to Petersburg to see Dounia and offers her ten thousand roubles to break off her engagement to Luzhin, claiming his passion for her has passed. He makes it clear that he will use Raskolnikov's secret against Dounia if Raskolnikov doesn't cooperate. Raskolnikov is enraged and threatens to kill him.

Meanwhile, Luzhin, still smarting from the broken engagement, makes a false accusation against Sonia at Marmeladov's memorial dinner, claiming she stole a hundred-rouble note from him. Lebeziatnikov, who witnessed Luzhin plant the money in Sonia's pocket, exposes Luzhin's scheme. Raskolnikov then reveals Luzhin's malicious motives: to discredit him and regain Dounia's favor. Luzhin is forced to leave. Katerina Ivanovna, in a fit of despair and madness, is evicted by the landlady and runs into the street with her children to beg. She collapses, bleeding from consumption, and is taken to Sonia's room, where she dies in Sonia's arms. Svidrigaïlov, who had been listening from the adjoining room, offers to take care of the Marmeladov children and give Sonia three thousand roubles.

Raskolnikov is deeply troubled. Dounia visits him, expressing love and offering support, but he pushes her away, saying he must be alone. He then goes to Sonia, confessing he killed Alyona Ivanovna and Lizaveta. He reveals he did it for power, to test his theory of being an ""extraordinary man,"" not for money, which he hid under a stone. Sonia, distraught, urges him to confess publicly, embrace suffering, and find redemption. He resists, still clinging to his pride and denying it was a ""crime"" but rather a ""blunder.""

Svidrigaïlov, after visiting his own young betrothed and giving her money, commits suicide with a revolver.

Raskolnikov, deeply shaken, finally accepts Sonia's plea. He goes to the Hay Market, kneels down, and kisses the earth, although the full confession of ""I am a murderer"" dies on his lips due to the mocking crowd. He sees Sonia watching him from afar. He then proceeds to the police station, where he encounters the ""Explosive Lieutenant,"" Ilya Petrovitch. He hears of Svidrigaïlov's suicide. With Sonia waiting outside, Raskolnikov, pale and trembling, confesses to Ilya Petrovitch that he ""killed the old pawnbroker woman and her sister Lizaveta with an axe and robbed them.""

In Siberia, Raskolnikov is sentenced to eight years of penal servitude. He confesses completely at his trial, explaining every detail, including the hidden items. The court, noting his refusal to use the stolen money and his hypochondriacal state, concludes he acted under ""temporary mental derangement."" Despite this, Raskolnikov maintains his crime was a ""blunder,"" not morally wrong, as his conscience is ""at rest."" He struggles with his wounded pride and the ""impossible gulf"" between himself and other convicts. He is reviled by his fellow prisoners as an ""infidel."" Sonia follows him to Siberia, visiting him regularly. Initially, Raskolnikov is sullen and distant, but gradually, through Sonia's unwavering love and his own suffering, he begins a ""gradual renewal"" and ""regeneration"" into a new life. He realizes he loves Sonia, and their shared suffering opens a path to a new, unknown future. The story ends with him picking up Sonia's New Testament, filled with the dawn of a new life, though the process of his full spiritual transformation is just beginning."
Death in Venice-Thomas Mann,"The story begins in Munich on a spring afternoon in 19--, with Gustav Aschenbach, a renowned writer, or von Aschenbach as he was officially known after his fiftieth birthday. Overworked and unable to rest after a demanding forenoon, he takes a long walk. As he waits for a tram at the North Cemetery, he notices a man with an unusual, somewhat pug-nosed, red-haired, and bold appearance. This encounter stirs in Aschenbach a powerful, long-dormant desire for travel, a ""youthful longing after far-off places,"" which he visualizes as a tropical, primeval swampland. He realizes this yearning is an urge to escape his rigorous work, which, despite his mastery, has become stalled and lacks emotional fire. He decides to take a short, restful trip to a pleasant resort in the South.

The narrative then delves into Aschenbach's background. He is the son of a high-ranking official, with ancestors known for their severe, steady lives, though his mother brought a more sensuous Bohemian influence. Aschenbach, always driven to build a reputation, achieved fame early through disciplined and painstaking effort, despite a frail constitution and a lack of carefree youth. He believed in ""carrying through"" and creating art that matured with age. His literary works, like the epic on Frederick of Prussia and the novel ""Maya,"" were meticulously crafted. He was celebrated for creating a new hero-type: an ""intellectual and youthful masculinity"" that maintained self-mastery against adversity. He had once renounced youthful skepticism and irony, embracing dignity and rejecting knowledge that might weaken the will, as seen in his story ""The Wretch."" His later style became more formal and conservative, earning him official recognition, including nobility on his fiftieth birthday. He settled in Munich, a widower with a married daughter. His face, though outwardly calm, bore the marks of his intense artistic life.

About two weeks after his walk, in mid-to-late May, Aschenbach departs. He travels by night train to Trieste, then by ship to an Adriatic island. However, the island's cold, damp weather, provincial clientele, and lack of a sandy beach dissatisfy him. He abruptly realizes his true destination is Venice. He leaves the island, taking a motorboat to a naval port and then boarding a decrepit Italian steamer bound for Venice. On board, he is disturbed by a man he initially perceives as a youth, but soon realizes is an old fop in disguise, wearing makeup, a wig, and false teeth, yet accepted by his younger companions. Aschenbach feels a ""dream-like estrangement.""

Upon arriving in the Venetian lagoon, the ship waits for a health department boat. During this wait, the old fop, now painfully drunk, makes lewd and offensive gestures. Aschenbach, repulsed, feels the world distorting. When the ship finally reaches San Marco, Aschenbach arranges for a gondola to take him to the Lido, intending to use a steamer. The drunken fop accosts him again with a strange, slurred farewell. Aschenbach boards a black gondola, which reminds him of a coffin and death. He is surprised when the gondolier, a brutal-looking, non-Italian man, heads for the open sea instead of the steamer dock. The gondolier insists Aschenbach is going directly to the Lido and dismisses his request for the steamer, claiming it won't take luggage. Aschenbach, feeling strangely inert and wondering if the man is a criminal, gives in. After paying money to a boatload of musical brigands who sing alongside, they reach the Lido. Aschenbach goes to get change for the gondolier at a hotel, only to find on his return that the gondola and gondolier have vanished. An old man on the dock informs him the gondolier was unlicensed and that Aschenbach had ridden for free.

Aschenbach proceeds to the beach hotel, where he is welcomed by the manager and shown to a pleasant room with a sea view. Still disturbed by the strange incidents, he observes the hotel guests. He is captivated by a Polish family, particularly a fourteen-year-old boy of extraordinary beauty, who reminds him of Greek sculpture. The boy, dressed luxuriously, stands in stark contrast to his chastely dressed sisters. Aschenbach watches the boy's polite interaction with his mother, a richly jeweled woman, and feels a peculiar touch.

The next day, the dreary weather and the persistent smell of the lagoon depress Aschenbach. He considers leaving again, fearing a return of old ailments. At breakfast, he sees the Polish girls and their governess, but not the boy. The boy, Tadzio, eventually appears, his graceful movements and ""godlike beauty"" astonishing Aschenbach. He wears a striking blue and white striped blouse. Aschenbach, delighted, feels he wants to stay as long as Tadzio does. On the beach, Aschenbach enjoys the scene, reflecting on his love for the ocean. He watches Tadzio, who, wading barefoot, displays a moment of scorn and detestation towards a Russian family. Aschenbach is both cheered and unsettled by this ""childish fanaticism."" He deciphers the boy's name as ""Tadzio."" He observes Tadzio playing with other children, including a boy named Jaschu, who kisses him. Aschenbach watches Tadzio emerge from the sea, a ""frail god,"" sparking a ""sense of myth"" in him. He feels a ""paternal affection"" for the boy.

Later, in the lift, Aschenbach sees Tadzio close up and notices his teeth are ""jagged and pale,"" suggesting he is ""frail, sickly,"" and ""will not grow old."" Aschenbach feels a peculiar ""gratification"" at this thought. That afternoon, Aschenbach visits Venice, but the oppressive sultriness, mixed odors, and crowds make him feel ill. He decides to leave the city, finding it unhealthy for him. He returns to his hotel, announces his departure for the next morning, and packs. The next morning, he regrets his hasty decision but feels compelled to follow through. As he finishes breakfast, Tadzio enters the buffet room, and their eyes meet. Aschenbach silently bids him farewell.

On the steamboat leaving Venice, Aschenbach is overcome with misery and spiritual hunger, realizing his deep attachment to the city and regretting his departure. He believes he can never return, as Venice twice affected his health. At the station, in an intense internal conflict, he discovers his large trunk was mistakenly sent to Como. Instead of being distressed, Aschenbach feels an ""adventurous delight"" and ""unbelievable hilarity."" He declares he won't travel without his trunk and decides to return to the Lido to wait for it. He manages to redeem his ticket and within twenty minutes is on a motorboat heading back to the Lido. He laughs at this ""comically dreamlike mishap,"" seeing it as fate driving him back, allowing him to rectify a grave error. He is met by the manager and given an almost identical room. Relaxing, he sees Tadzio returning from the sea. Aschenbach feels ""exhilaration,"" realizing Tadzio was the reason his departure was so difficult. He makes a ""spontaneous act of welcome, of calm acceptance.""

Days pass in sunny, idle comfort. Aschenbach remains at the Lido, fully unpacked. He frequently sees Tadzio on the beach, observing his movements, his beauty, and his interactions with his companions. He is constantly astonished by Tadzio's delicate appeal, feeling he is witnessing ""the beautiful itself, form as the thought of God."" He is inspired by this ""drunkenness"" and, recalling Plato's Phaedrus, feels an irresistible desire to write. He works on a prose tract in Tadzio's presence, using the boy's ""godlike"" form as his aesthetic standard. After these efforts, he feels exhausted and his conscience ""complaining after some transgression.""

One morning, he attempts to approach Tadzio on the beach to strike up a friendly acquaintance but is overcome by a pounding heart and shortness of breath, forcing him to pass by with bowed head. He realizes he doesn't want ""soberness""; his ""intoxication was too precious."" He dismisses self-criticism and jokes about his ""comically pious distress."" He extends his stay, sending for more money, his only concern now Tadzio's possible departure. He spends his days basking in the sun and sea air, feeling a renewed sense of elation and emotion. His sleep is fitful, and he wakes at dawn to watch the sunrise, imagining Eros rising and Tadzio as Hyacinth, a beautiful youth loved by gods and destined to die. He observes Tadzio's subtle gestures, noticing that the boy now passes closer to his spot on the beach.

One evening, Tadzio, returning from the city with his family, meets Aschenbach's gaze and smiles ""eloquently, familiarly, charmingly, without concealment""—a ""smile of Narcissus."" Overwhelmed, Aschenbach flees to the dark park, whispering, ""I love you!""

In his fourth week at the Lido, Aschenbach notices fewer guests, especially Germans. He overhears the barber mention ""the plague."" Later, in Venice, he detects a sweet, drug-like smell of sickness and sees official posters warning against gastric diseases, euphemistically covering up a deeper issue. A shop proprietor evasively dismisses his questions. Back at the hotel, Aschenbach finds censored newspapers, confirming a cover-up. He feels a ""dark contentment"" that the world's disorder conspires with his own secret passion, fearing Tadzio's departure more than the plague.

He now stalks Tadzio, following him covertly through Venice's labyrinthine streets and canals. He even takes a gondola to pursue Tadzio's. He finds himself caught in a decadent enchantment, recalling that Venice is a diseased city concealing its condition. He returns late one evening, pressing his head against Tadzio's room door, overwhelmed by his infatuation. He has moments of self-reproach, recalling his ancestors' rigid principles and reflecting on how his life, devoted to art and passion, has become ""degenerate,"" leading him down a ""perilous road."" He learns the truth about the spreading Indian cholera from an English clerk: the disease has taken hold in Venice, with high fatality rates, and authorities are suppressing the information for economic reasons, leading to demoralization and increased crime. The clerk advises him to leave immediately before a quarantine.

Aschenbach, though horrified, feels a ""feverish excitement"" and ""triumph"" in possessing this secret. He considers warning Tadzio's mother but realizes he doesn't truly want to. He whispers, ""It must be kept silent!"" and ""I will keep silent!"" His complicity intoxicates him, and he chooses to stay. That night, he experiences a ""frightful dream"" of a Dionysian orgy, a violent, lewd bacchanalian ritual where he is overwhelmed and embraces the ""unchastity and fury of decay.""

He wakes shattered, no longer caring about being noticed. Guests are fleeing, but Tadzio's family remains. Aschenbach feels that flight and death might remove all distractions, leaving him alone with the boy. He tries to please Tadzio, rejuvenating his appearance with youthful clothes, jewels, and perfumes. He frequently visits the barber, who dyes his hair black, curls it, touches up his eyes, adds crimson to his cheeks, and smooths his wrinkles, making him look young again. The barber tells him, ""Now the gentleman can fall in love unhesitatingly."" Aschenbach, transformed, feels ""happy as in a dream.""

One afternoon, he tracks Tadzio deep into the diseased city, becoming lost. Tadzio, lagging behind his family, repeatedly turns to glance back at Aschenbach, acknowledging his presence but not betraying him. Aschenbach, ""drunk with the knowledge of this,"" follows until he loses sight of Tadzio after a bridge. Exhausted and parched, he buys and eats overly ripe strawberries. He sits by a cistern in a quiet square, reflecting on his fall from dignity and the perilous road of the artist, which leads to ""intoxication and to desire,"" and ultimately to ""the precipice."" He concludes his internal monologue by saying, ""I am going, Phaedrus. You stay here; and when you no longer see me, then you go too.""

A few days later, feeling unwell with vertigo and malaise, Aschenbach learns that the Polish family is leaving after lunch. He nods and goes to the beach, which now has an ""air of autumn"" and is almost abandoned. Tadzio is playing a degenerating game with his remaining companions. Jaschu, in a wrestling match, pins Tadzio and nearly strangles him in the sand. Aschenbach, enraged, is about to intervene when Jaschu releases him. Tadzio, pale and upset, walks slowly away, ignoring his companions, and goes to the water's edge. He wades out to a sand-bank, stands facing the open sea, then slowly walks along the narrow stretch of ground. He stops, turns in a beautiful twist, and looks back towards the shore. His gaze meets Aschenbach's. Aschenbach's head sinks to his breast, his face taking on the ""relaxed expression of deep sleep."" It seems to him that Tadzio is smiling and nodding, signaling him to come out, guiding him towards ""egregious promises."" Aschenbach stands up to follow him.

Minutes later, Aschenbach collapses in his chair. He is brought to his room, and ""on the same day a respectfully shocked world received the news of his death."""

**Volume I**

**Chapter I: Which treats of the character and pursuits of the famous gentleman Don Quixote of La Mancha**
The story introduces an unnamed gentleman from a village in La Mancha, nearly fifty years old, of a hardy, lean constitution. He lives with a housekeeper over forty, a niece under twenty, and a young lad. He spends most of his income on food and clothes, maintaining a modest household. This gentleman devotes all his leisure time, which is most of the year, to reading books of chivalry with such intensity that he neglects his property and sells land to acquire more books. He particularly enjoys the works of Feliciano de Silva. Through excessive reading and little sleep, his brain dries up, and he loses his wits, coming to believe all the impossible tales of enchantments, battles, and romances in his books are true. He prefers knights like the Knight of the Burning Sword, Bernardo del Carpio, Morgante, and Reinaldos of Montalban, often wishing to emulate their deeds.

His madness leads him to the strange idea that he must become a knight-errant himself, roaming the world in armor on horseback, seeking adventures to right wrongs and achieve eternal renown. He envisions himself becoming at least Emperor of Trebizond. To begin, he cleans an old suit of armor inherited from his great-grandfather, but discovers it lacks a closed helmet. He ingeniously fashions a half-helmet from pasteboard, which he reinforces with iron after a test with his sword shatters it. Next, he dedicates four days to naming his old, lean hack, finally settling on Rocinante, a name he deems lofty and significant of the horse's transformation. He then spends eight days choosing a name for himself, deciding on Don Quixote, and adds ""of La Mancha"" to honor his homeland, following the example of Amadis of Gaul. Finally, he concludes that a knight-errant requires a lady-love. He chooses Aldonza Lorenzo, a good-looking farm-girl from a nearby village with whom he was once smitten (though she was unaware), and renames her Dulcinea del Toboso, a musical and significant name.

**Chapter II: Which treats of the first sally the ingenious Don Quixote made from home**
With his preparations complete, Don Quixote, without informing anyone, dons his armor, mounts Rocinante with his improvised helmet, takes his buckler and lance, and sets out before dawn. As he rides, a terrible thought strikes him: he has not been dubbed a knight, which is essential for a knight-errant. He resolves to be knighted by the first person he encounters and to scour his armor white at the first opportunity. He then lets Rocinante choose the path, believing this will lead to adventures. He talks to himself, imagining a chronicler recording his first sally and addressing his lady Dulcinea. He travels all day without finding any adventure, growing desperate.

Towards nightfall, exhausted and hungry, he spots an inn. His deluded mind transforms it into a magnificent castle with turrets, a drawbridge, and a moat. At the door, he sees two young women, whom he mistakes for fair maidens or ladies of the castle. A swineherd's horn blast, intended for his pigs, is interpreted by Don Quixote as a dwarf's trumpet announcing his arrival. He approaches the women and addresses them with formal knightly courtesy, calling them ""ladyships."" Their laughter at his strange appearance and language offends him, but he reiterates his desire to serve them. The innkeeper, a fat and peaceful man, emerges and, amused by Don Quixote's appearance, offers lodging (though without a bed). Don Quixote addresses him as ""Sir Castellan"" and quotes knightly verses. He dismounts with great difficulty and asks the innkeeper to care for Rocinante.

The women help him remove his armor, but he refuses to let them cut the ribbons securing his helmet, so he remains helmeted. He introduces himself as Don Quixote of La Mancha and his horse as Rocinante. He requests food. It being Friday, only stockfish is available, which he accepts, imagining it to be trout. Due to his helmet, one of the maidens must feed him, and the innkeeper uses a reed to pour wine into his mouth. The sound of a sowgelder's pipe is interpreted as castle music. Don Quixote feels he has made a grand beginning but remains distressed that he has not been formally dubbed a knight.

**Chapter III: Wherein is related the droll way in which Don Quixote had himself dubbed a knight**
Driven by his desire to be knighted, Don Quixote finishes his meager supper and kneels before the innkeeper in the stable. He demands the boon of being dubbed a knight the following morning, after watching his arms all night in the ""chapel"" of the ""castle."" The innkeeper, perceiving Don Quixote's madness, decides to humor him. He pretends to be a former knight-errant himself, recounting a life of roguish adventures across Spain, but states there is no chapel in his ""castle."" He suggests Don Quixote watch his arms in the courtyard. The innkeeper also advises Don Quixote to carry money, clean shirts, and ointment, as true knights-errant always do, despite histories omitting such mundane details. Don Quixote promises to follow this advice.

Don Quixote places his armor on a trough by a well and begins his vigil, pacing with his lance and buckler. The inn's occupants gather to observe him. As night deepens, one of the carriers attempts to move Don Quixote's armor to water his mules. Don Quixote warns him loudly, but the carrier ignores him and flings the armor away. Invoking Dulcinea, Don Quixote strikes the carrier with his lance, knocking him unconscious. He then retrieves his armor and resumes his watch. Shortly after, another carrier attempts the same, and Don Quixote again strikes him, inflicting a severe head wound. The inn's occupants rush out. Don Quixote, drawing his sword, challenges them all, declaring himself ready to fight for Dulcinea. The carriers' comrades throw stones, but Don Quixote shields himself. The innkeeper shouts that Don Quixote is mad, while Don Quixote calls the innkeeper a villain for allowing such treatment. The stoning eventually ceases, and the wounded are carried off.

The innkeeper, eager to end the disturbance, decides to perform the knighting ceremony immediately. He tells Don Quixote that a chapel is unnecessary, and the essential parts of the ritual (accolade and shoulder slap) can be done anywhere. He retrieves his account-book, a candle, and the two maidens. He bids Don Quixote kneel and reads from the account-book as if it were a prayer. He gives Don Quixote a hard blow on the neck and a slap on the shoulder with his own sword. He then instructs one maiden, La Tolosa, to gird on Don Quixote's sword, and the other, La Molinera, to buckle his spur. Don Quixote, in turn, asks them to adopt the ""Doña"" title.

With the hasty ceremony concluded, Don Quixote is eager to depart. He embraces the innkeeper, thanking him in extravagant language. The innkeeper, equally eager to be rid of him, replies with short rhetoric and lets him leave without paying his bill.

**Chapter IV: Of what happened to our knight when he left the inn**
Don Quixote departs at dawn, overjoyed at being a dubbed knight. Recalling the innkeeper's advice about money and a squire, he decides to return home to equip himself. He also intends to recruit a neighboring farm-laborer as his squire. On his way, he hears cries from a thicket. Believing it to be an adventure, he investigates. He finds a youth of about fifteen, Andres, tied to an oak and being flogged by a farmer for carelessness with sheep. Don Quixote angrily intervenes, calling the farmer a ""discourteous knight"" and demanding he pay Andres his overdue wages of sixty-three reals. The farmer, terrified, agrees but tries to deduct for shoes and medical treatment. Don Quixote dismisses these, stating they are offset by the blows. The farmer claims he has no money and asks Andres to come home with him for payment. Andres refuses, fearing more beatings. Don Quixote guarantees the payment, asserting the farmer's oath by the order of knighthood. Andres reveals the farmer is not a knight, but Juan Haldudo the Rich. Don Quixote insists that everyone is the ""son of his works"" and warns the farmer of severe punishment if he fails to pay. He declares his name as ""Don Quixote of La Mancha, the undoer of wrongs and injustices"" and rides off.

Once Don Quixote is out of sight, the farmer ties Andres up again and flogs him even more severely, mocking Don Quixote's title. Andres, weeping, vows to find Don Quixote and report the renewed abuse. Don Quixote, however, rides on, thoroughly satisfied with having ""righted that wrong."" He then comes to a crossroads and, in imitation of knights-errant, lets Rocinante choose the way, which leads towards his village. After two miles, he sees a party of six Toledo traders, with four mounted servants and three muleteers. Don Quixote mistakes them for a new adventure involving knights-errant. He positions himself in the middle of the road and demands they confess that Dulcinea del Toboso is the fairest maiden in the world. The traders, guessing his madness, playfully ask for a portrait of Dulcinea, joking that even a flawed image would suffice for their confession. Don Quixote, enraged by their implied blasphemy against Dulcinea's beauty, charges the speaker. Rocinante stumbles and falls, throwing Don Quixote. Unable to rise due to his armor, Don Quixote continues to shout challenges. One of the muleteers seizes Don Quixote's lance, breaks it, and beats him severely. The muleteer is eventually stopped by his masters, and the traders depart, leaving Don Quixote battered and unable to move. Despite his injuries, Don Quixote considers himself fortunate, believing it to be a common mishap for knights-errant and blaming his horse.

**Chapter V: In which the narrative of our knight’s mishap is continued**
Finding himself unable to move, Don Quixote recalls a passage from his books about Baldwin, wounded on a mountainside, and begins to recite the ballad, believing himself to be Baldwin. A peasant from his own village, Pedro Alonso, happens by and asks about his distress. Don Quixote, mistaking the peasant for the Marquis of Mantua (Baldwin's uncle), continues his lament in verse. The peasant, amazed by his nonsense, removes Don Quixote's battered visor, wipes his face, and recognizes him as Señor Quixada. He tries to understand what happened, but Don Quixote only continues the ballad. The peasant removes Don Quixote's breastplate and backpiece, finding no wounds, then lifts him onto his ass. He ties Don Quixote's armor onto Rocinante and leads both animals toward the village, saddened by Don Quixote's continuous absurdities.

Don Quixote, bruised and unable to sit upright, sighs deeply. He then shifts his delusion, imagining himself as the Moor Abindarraez, taken prisoner by Rodrigo de Narvaez, and responds to the peasant's inquiries in this new persona. The peasant concludes his neighbor is entirely mad and hurries towards the village. Don Quixote, ending his speech, declares that ""Xarifa"" is now Dulcinea del Toboso, for whom he performs chivalric deeds. The peasant attempts to correct him, stating their real identities. Don Quixote retorts that he knows who he is and can be any of the Twelve Peers of France or Nine Worthies.

They reach the village at nightfall, and the peasant waits until it is darker to avoid attracting attention to Don Quixote's disheveled state. He finds Don Quixote's housekeeper and niece with the village curate (Pero Perez) and barber (Master Nicholas). The housekeeper is distraught by Don Quixote's three-day disappearance, blaming his books of chivalry for driving him mad and leading him to seek adventures. The niece corroborates, describing his past episodes of fighting walls and believing sweat was blood. The curate agrees to conduct a ""public judgment"" on the books the next day. The peasant announces Don Quixote's return, using the names from his delusions. They all rush out, recognizing him. Don Quixote, still believing himself wounded, asks to be carried to bed and for the ""wise Urganda"" to cure him. The housekeeper curses the books, while they carry him to bed. They find no wounds, but Don Quixote claims they are bruises from battling ten giants. The curate vows to burn the books. Don Quixote asks for food and sleep. The curate questions the peasant at length about Don Quixote's experiences, then plans with the barber to visit him again the next day.

**Chapter VI: Of the diverting and important scrutiny which the curate and the barber made in the library of our ingenious gentleman**
While Don Quixote sleeps, the curate asks the niece for the keys to the library. The housekeeper, niece, curate, and barber enter. The housekeeper, fearing magic, sprinkles holy water. The curate and barber decide to inspect the books one by one, to see if any deserve to be spared the fire. The niece and housekeeper advocate burning them all immediately.

They begin the scrutiny:
*   **""The four books of Amadis of Gaul""**: The curate considers burning it as the founder of the ""vile sect"" of chivalry books, but the barber argues it's the best of its kind and should be pardoned. It is spared for now.
*   **""Sergas de Esplandian"" (Amadis's son)**: Condemned and thrown into the yard.
*   **""Amadis of Greece"" and other Amadis lineage books**: All thrown into the yard.
*   **""Don Olivante de Laura""**: Thrown out as a ""swaggering fool.""
*   **""Florismarte of Hircania""**: Thrown out for its ""stiffness and dryness.""
*   **""The Knight Platir""**: Condemned and thrown out.
*   **""The Knight of the Cross""**: Thrown to the fire, despite its holy name, because ""behind the cross there's the devil.""
*   **""The Mirror of Chivalry"" (featuring Reinaldos and the Twelve Peers)**: Banished to a dry well; the curate specifies exceptions for ""Bernardo del Carpio"" and ""Roncesvalles"" (these would be burned).
*   **""Palmerin de Oliva""**: Burned.
*   **""Palmerin of England""**: Preserved as unique and excellent, said to be written by a wise king of Portugal.
*   **""Don Belianis"" (parts 2, 3, 4)**: To be kept by the barber, awaiting ""purging"" of its excesses.
*   The barber, tired, tells the housekeeper to throw all remaining large books into the yard, which she happily does. One book falls, revealing its title: **""History of the Famous Knight, Tirante el Blanco.""** The curate praises it as the ""best book in the world"" for its realism (knights eat, sleep, die in beds), but ironically suggests the author deserves galleys for ""composing such fooleries."" He tells the barber to read it.
*   They then turn to smaller books, which are poetry. The niece suggests burning these too, fearing her uncle will turn into a shepherd or poet.
*   **""Diana"" of Jorge de Montemayor**: Not burned, but to be purged of magic elements and long verses.
*   **""Diana, Second Part, by the Salamancan""**: Condemned. **Gil Polo's ""Diana""**: Preserved.
*   **""The Fortune of Love"" (Antonio de Lofraso)**: Praised as droll and unique, kept by the curate.
*   **""The Shepherd of Iberia,"" ""Nymphs of Henares,"" ""The Enlightenment of Jealousy""**: Given to the housekeeper for disposal.
*   **""Pastor de Fílida""**: Preserved as a ""precious jewel.""
*   **""The Treasury of various Poems""**: To be ""weeded and cleansed"" of vulgarities but preserved due to the author being a friend.
*   **""Cancionero"" of Lopez de Maldonado**: Preserved due to the author being a friend and having a sweet voice.
*   **""The Galatea"" of Miguel de Cervantes**: To be kept shut up, awaiting a second part.
*   **""The Araucana,"" ""The Austriada,"" and ""The Montserrate""**: Preserved as the best Castilian heroic verses.
*   The curate, tired, orders all remaining ""contents uncertified"" books to be burned. The barber then mentions **""The Tears of Angelica,""** which the curate says he would have saved had he known, praising its author.

**Chapter VII: Of the second sally of our worthy knight Don Quixote of La Mancha**
Don Quixote's shouts of ""Here, here, valiant knights!"" about a tourney interrupt the book scrutiny. They rush to his room and find him out of bed, shouting and slashing with his sword. They force him back to bed. He speaks to the curate as Archbishop Turpin, lamenting a defeat in a tourney. The curate humors him. Don Quixote claims to have been bruised by ""that bastard Don Roland"" out of envy. He demands food and vows vengeance. They feed him, and he falls asleep.

That night, the housekeeper burns all the condemned books. The curate and barber wall up the library door and plaster it, intending to tell Don Quixote that a magician carried off the room and books. Two days later, Don Quixote wakes and finds his library gone. The housekeeper and niece tell him that a magician, ""Sage Muñaton"" (or Friston/Friton), rode on a serpent, flew through the roof, and carried off the room and books due to a grudge. Don Quixote identifies the magician as his enemy, Sage Friston, who seeks to thwart his future triumphs. His niece tries to persuade him to stay home, but Don Quixote dismisses her.

He remains home quietly for fifteen days, holding lively discussions with the curate and barber about the necessity of knights-errant. He persuades a farm laborer, Sancho Panza, a poor man with little wit, to become his squire, promising him the government of an island. Sancho, enticed, leaves his wife and children. Don Quixote raises money by selling and pawning property. He procures a buckler (on loan) and repairs his helmet. He instructs Sancho to bring saddlebags and his ass, which Don Quixote initially hesitates about but then allows, planning to find a more honorable mount for him later. Without taking leave of their families, Don Quixote and Sancho depart secretly one night for El Toboso.

Sancho rides on his ass, looking forward to governing an island. Don Quixote assures him that ancient knights-errant always made their squires governors or even kings, and he intends to do the same for Sancho, possibly within six days. Sancho asks if his wife, Mari Gutierrez, and children will become queen and infantes. Don Quixote confirms, but Sancho doubts his wife's suitability for a queen, suggesting ""countess"" as a better fit. Don Quixote advises him not to undervalue himself.

**Chapter VIII: Of the good fortune which the valiant Don Quixote had in the terrible and undreamt-of adventure of the windmills, with other occurrences worthy to be fitly recorded**
They encounter about thirty or forty windmills. Don Quixote immediately declares them to be monstrous giants he must fight to gain spoils and serve God by ridding the earth of such evil. Sancho insists they are windmills. Don Quixote dismisses Sancho's warnings, calls him afraid, and charges the first windmill. A slight breeze makes the sails move. Don Quixote, invoking Dulcinea, charges with his lance. The wind whirls the sail, shattering his lance and sweeping him and Rocinante to the ground. Sancho rushes to his aid, again stating they were windmills. Don Quixote, however, attributes the transformation to the sage Friston, his enemy, who seeks to rob him of victory.

Sancho helps Don Quixote back onto Rocinante, whose shoulder is dislocated. Don Quixote laments the loss of his lance and vows to make a new one from an oak branch, like the Spanish knight Diego Perez de Vargas. Sancho notes Don Quixote's crooked posture. Don Quixote states knights-errant cannot complain of wounds, but assures Sancho that squires are permitted to. Sancho is satisfied.

Sancho eats from his saddlebags and drinks from his wine-skin. He finds joy in seeking adventures, regardless of danger. They camp among trees. Don Quixote uses a dry branch for a lance and spends the night thinking of Dulcinea. Sancho sleeps soundly.

The next morning, they continue toward Puerto Lapice. Don Quixote warns Sancho not to intervene if they encounter knights, only if they face ""rabble or base folk."" Sancho agrees, but reserves the right of self-defense. They see two Benedictine friars on tall mules (which Don Quixote calls ""dromedaries""), followed by a coach carrying a lady and her attendants. Don Quixote immediately concludes the friars are magicians abducting a princess. Sancho attempts to correct him. Don Quixote charges the first friar, knocking him off his mule. The second friar flees. Sancho, believing this to be battle spoil, attempts to strip the fallen friar. The friars' muleteers, not understanding, attack Sancho, beating him senseless.

Meanwhile, Don Quixote addresses the lady in the coach, claiming to have liberated her and demanding she travel to El Toboso to present herself before Dulcinea del Toboso and recount her deliverance. A Biscayan squire attending the coach intervenes, demanding Don Quixote allow them to pass. Don Quixote insults him. The Biscayan draws his sword, using a coach cushion as a shield. They fight fiercely. Don Quixote, after invoking Dulcinea, strikes the Biscayan, knocking him to the ground. He demands surrender. The ladies in the coach implore him to spare the squire's life. Don Quixote agrees on the condition that the Biscayan go to El Toboso and present himself to Dulcinea. The ladies promise this.

**Chapter IX: In which is concluded and finished the terrific battle between the gallant Biscayan and the valiant Manchegan**
(The author Cide Hamete Benengeli, through his translator, breaks the narrative here, lamenting the missing conclusion to Don Quixote's battle. The translator describes how he found the continuation in Arabic pamphlets in Toledo. He employed a Morisco to translate them, finding they comprised the ""History of Don Quixote of La Mancha, written by Cid Hamete Benengeli, an Arab historian."" He describes illustrations depicting the battle, Rocinante, and Sancho Panza, noting Sancho's two surnames: Panza and Zancas. He criticizes the Arab author for potentially omitting praise for Don Quixote.)

The narrative then resumes: The two combatants stood with raised swords. The Biscayan strikes Don Quixote's left shoulder, taking off part of his helmet and half his ear. Don Quixote, enraged, strikes the Biscayan with fury, causing him to bleed from his nose, mouth, and ears. The Biscayan's mule, frightened, throws him to the ground. Don Quixote leaps from Rocinante, presents his sword to the Biscayan's eyes, and demands surrender or death. The ladies in the coach, terrified, implore Don Quixote to spare their squire. Don Quixote agrees on the condition that the Biscayan go to El Toboso and present himself before Dulcinea del Toboso. The ladies promise.

**Chapter X: Of the pleasant discourse that passed between Don Quixote and his squire Sancho Panza**
Sancho, having recovered from his beating by the muleteers, witnesses the end of the battle. He kneels before Don Quixote, asking for the government of the island he believes has been won. Don Quixote clarifies that this was merely a ""cross-roads"" adventure, yielding only a broken head, and assures him that greater adventures will come. Sancho thanks him and helps him mount Rocinante. Don Quixote rides into a nearby wood without taking leave of the ladies. Sancho, unable to keep up, calls for his master to wait.

Sancho suggests they seek refuge in a church from the Holy Brotherhood. Don Quixote dismisses the idea, stating knights-errant are not subject to such laws. He boasts of his own valor. Sancho, while agreeing to his master's daring, asks him to dress his bleeding ear and offers lint and ointment. Don Quixote tells him he has the recipe for the ""balsam of Fierabras"" which could instantly heal any wound, even reattaching a body cut in half. Sancho, amazed, offers to renounce his promised island for this recipe. Don Quixote agrees to teach him later.

While Sancho dresses his wound, Don Quixote, seeing his shattered helmet, vows to live like the Marquis of Mantua (no tablecloth, no embrace of wife, etc.) until he obtains vengeance or a new helmet. Sancho reminds him the Biscayan is going to Dulcinea. Don Quixote retracts the vengeance part of the oath but maintains the rest until he finds a new helmet. Sancho complains about the oath's impracticality in a world without armed knights. Don Quixote dismisses his concerns.

Don Quixote asks for food. Sancho offers an onion, cheese, and bread, deeming them unfit for a knight. Don Quixote explains that knights-errant often endure hunger and eat rustic fare. Sancho agrees to pack dry fruit for his master and substantial food for himself. They eat, then ride to seek lodging, but night overtakes them near some goatherds' huts. Don Quixote is content to sleep under the open sky, seeing it as a proper knightly act.

**Chapter XI: What befell Don Quixote with certain goatherds**
The goatherds cordially welcome Don Quixote and Sancho. Sancho, drawn by the smell of cooking goat, observes them lay out a rustic meal on sheepskins. Don Quixote insists Sancho sit beside him, explaining that knight-errantry levels all social distinctions. Sancho, however, prefers eating alone and standing, valuing liberty. The goatherds eat in silence, staring at their guests. After the meat, they offer parched acorns and hard cheese. A horn of wine circulates frequently.

When Don Quixote has finished eating, he picks up some acorns and delivers a long, elaborate speech about the Golden Age, a time of peace, abundance, and innocence, where ""mine"" and ""thine"" were unknown, and maidens roamed freely. He states that the order of knights-errant was instituted to protect such maidens and succor the needy. He thanks the goatherds for their hospitality. The goatherds listen in silent amazement. Sancho eats acorns and drinks wine.

**Chapter XII: Of what a goatherd related to those with Don Quixote**
Another young goatherd arrives, announcing the death of Chrysostom, a student-shepherd, from love for a shepherdess named Marcela. He relates that Chrysostom's will requests burial in the fields like a Moor, at the Cork-tree spring where he first saw Marcela. His friend Ambrosio insists on fulfilling the will despite clerical objections to paganism. The burial is set for the next day, and many villagers plan to attend. Don Quixote and the goatherds resolve to go. One goatherd, Pedro, stays behind due to a foot injury.

Don Quixote asks Pedro about Chrysostom and Marcela. Pedro explains Chrysostom was a wealthy, learned gentleman from Salamanca, skilled in predicting eclipses and good harvests (which enriched his family). He returned to his village, then, with his friend Ambrosio, adopted the shepherd's dress. Pedro reveals Chrysostom was also a poet. He then describes Marcela: daughter of the rich Guillermo, who died at her birth. She was raised by her priest uncle, grew up exceptionally beautiful, attracting countless suitors. She consistently refused marriage, choosing a life of chaste solitude as a shepherdess. Despite her affability, her scorn drives her lovers to despair. Pedro points out that trees are carved with Marcela's name and laments of her rejected suitors echo through the mountains. He advises Don Quixote to attend the burial. Don Quixote agrees. Sancho, eager for sleep, urges his master to retire to Pedro's hut. Don Quixote, thinking of Dulcinea, agrees.

**Chapter XIII: In which is ended the story of the shepherdess Marcela, with other incidents**
At dawn, Don Quixote and the goatherds set out for Chrysostom's burial. They meet a group of six shepherds in black, carrying a bier, accompanied by two gentlemen on horseback and three servants. All are headed to the burial site. One gentleman, Vivaldo, asks about Marcela and Chrysostom, and the shepherds recount the same story Pedro told. Vivaldo then asks Don Quixote why he travels armed. Don Quixote explains his profession as a knight-errant, defending the weak and needy, a more arduous life than that of courtiers or even monks.

Vivaldo questions the knight-errant's practice of commending themselves to ladies before battle, suggesting it's heathenish. Don Quixote argues it is a natural and necessary custom, though they also pray to God. He dismisses Vivaldo's doubt that not all knights have ladies, asserting it is impossible for a knight-errant to be without one. When asked, Don Quixote describes his lady, Dulcinea del Toboso, as having superhuman beauty (golden hair, sun-like eyes, pearl teeth, etc.) and noble, though modern, lineage. The company, including the goatherds, recognizes Don Quixote's madness, but Sancho, who knows his master from birth, believes him, only doubting Dulcinea's existence.

They reach the burial site, where twenty shepherds are digging a grave. Ambrosio, Chrysostom's friend, confirms this is where Chrysostom first saw Marcela and was scorned. He plans to burn Chrysostom's love writings. Vivaldo objects, arguing the writings should be preserved as a warning. Ambrosio permits him to take some papers, one of which is titled ""Lay of Despair.""

**Chapter XIV: Wherein are inserted the despairing verses of the dead shepherd, together with other incidents not looked for**
Vivaldo reads Chrysostom's ""Lay of Despair"" aloud. The poem expresses the depths of his suffering from Marcela's cruelty, disdain, jealousy, and absence. He details his torment, wishing his death to be her festival. The listeners approve the poem, though some question the complaints of jealousy given Marcela's reputation for reserve. Ambrosio explains that Chrysostom wrote the lay during a voluntary absence from Marcela, where imaginary fears tormented him, thus preserving Marcela's virtue.

As Vivaldo is about to read another paper, Marcela herself appears on the rock above the grave, stunning everyone with her beauty. Ambrosio angrily confronts her, accusing her of coming to gloat. Marcela replies that she came to defend herself against the accusations of those who blame her for Chrysostom's death. She eloquently argues that beauty does not obligate love, and her choice to live in solitude to preserve her honor and freedom should not be condemned. She states she gave no hope to Chrysostom, and his death was due to his own ""obstinacy,"" not her cruelty. She concludes by saying she covets no one's wealth, loves freedom, and neither loves nor hates anyone. She seeks pity from Heaven, not from men.

Without waiting for a reply, Marcela vanishes into the wood. Some of her admirers move to follow. Don Quixote, seeing this as an opportunity to aid a distressed damsel, draws his sword and forbids anyone from pursuing her, asserting that her arguments prove her innocence and she deserves honor. The shepherds, deterred by Don Quixote and Ambrosio, remain. They complete the burial, burn Chrysostom's papers (except those Vivaldo kept), and Ambrosio plans an epitaph. Vivaldo and his companion depart, discussing Marcela and Don Quixote. Don Quixote declines their invitation to Seville, resolved to clear the mountains of highwaymen first. He then decides to go in search of Marcela to offer his services. The chapter ends, stating that the Second Part of the history begins here.

**Chapter XV: In which is related the unfortunate adventure that Don Quixote fell in with when he fell out with certain heartless Yanguesans**
Don Quixote and Sancho search for Marcela for over two hours but cannot find her. They halt in a grassy glade by a cool stream to rest during the midday heat. Don Quixote and Sancho eat from their saddlebags. Sancho leaves Rocinante unhobbled, trusting his horse's calm nature. However, a drove of Galician ponies belonging to Yanguesan carriers is also resting nearby. Rocinante, attracted, attempts to approach the mares but is met with kicks and bites, which break his girths. The carriers then beat Rocinante severely.

Don Quixote and Sancho rush over. Don Quixote, seeing the carriers as ""base folk,"" tells Sancho they can legally take vengeance. Sancho points out their numerical disadvantage (twenty to two). Don Quixote declares he counts for a hundred, draws his sword, and attacks, deeply wounding one carrier. Sancho follows suit. The Yanguesans, armed with stakes, beat both Don Quixote and Sancho to the ground. Don Quixote falls at Rocinante's feet. The Yanguesans, seeing the damage, quickly load their teams and depart.

Sancho recovers consciousness first and calls to Don Quixote, asking for the balsam of Fierabras. Don Quixote laments not having it but vows to possess it within two days. Sancho asks how long it will take for them to recover. Don Quixote blames himself for attacking non-knights, believing it a punishment for violating the laws of chivalry. He advises Sancho to fight ""rabble"" himself in the future, promising his aid against knights. Sancho, a man of peace, rejects this, vowing not to draw his sword and forgiving all insults. He says he has a wife and children to support. Don Quixote argues a governor needs courage. Sancho says he is more fit for plasters and urges Don Quixote to get up and help Rocinante.

Don Quixote reminds Sancho of the hardships of knight-errantry, citing Amadis of Gaul's beatings. He explains that wounds from ""stakes"" do not cause indignity. Sancho, whose ribs still ache, insists the blows were real. Don Quixote reminds him that time and death heal all pain. Sancho wishes for a quicker remedy. Don Quixote suggests Dapple can carry him to a castle. Sancho helps Don Quixote onto Dapple ""like a sack of manure,"" then struggles to get Rocinante up.

Sancho leads them toward the high road, where they spot an inn. Sancho insists it is an inn, but Don Quixote, true to his delusions, insists it is a castle. They reach the inn before their argument is resolved.

**Chapter XVI: Of what happened to the ingenious gentleman in the inn which he took to be a castle**
The innkeeper asks Sancho about Don Quixote's condition. Sancho attributes it to a fall from a rock. The innkeeper's kind-hearted wife and daughter, along with an Asturian servant named Maritornes, tend to Don Quixote, applying plasters. The hostess notes his welts look more like blows than a fall. Sancho explains it was a rocky fall and asks for tow for his own sore loins. He explains Don Quixote is Don Quixote of La Mancha, a knight-adventurer who will eventually become an emperor and make his squire wealthy. The hostess questions why Sancho is not yet a count. Sancho replies it's too soon.

Don Quixote, sitting up, thanks the hostess for her hospitality in her ""castle"" and praises himself. He flirtatiously implies that if he were not bound by his fidelity to Dulcinea, he would be captivated by her daughter. The women are bewildered but understand his goodwill. Maritornes goes to care for Sancho. The innkeeper's carrier, who had arranged a liaison with Maritornes that night, is also quartered in the same garret as Don Quixote and Sancho.

Don Quixote, lying awake in pain, imagines the inn is a famous castle and the innkeeper's daughter is a love-smitten princess coming to his bed. He resolves to remain faithful to Dulcinea. Maritornes enters the dark room to meet the carrier. Don Quixote mistakes her for the princess, grabs her wrist, and pulls her onto his bed. He romantically describes her as a goddess of beauty, transforming her rough features and clothes in his mind, and praises her ""great beauty"" while explaining he cannot reciprocate due to his pledge to Dulcinea. Maritornes struggles to free herself. The carrier, overhearing and growing jealous, strikes Don Quixote in the face, then tramples his ribs as the bed collapses. The innkeeper, awakened by the crash, lights a lamp and rushes in, suspecting Maritornes. Maritornes, terrified, jumps into Sancho's bed. Sancho, waking, mistakes her for a nightmare and punches her, receiving blows in return. The carrier, seeing his lover attacked, joins the fight, as does the innkeeper, aiming to punish Maritornes. All four fight in the dark.

An officer of the Holy Brotherhood, also lodging there, enters the room. He trips over the fallen Don Quixote, feels his beard, and believing him dead, shouts that a murder has occurred. Everyone stops fighting and retreats. The officer, unable to find a light, goes to the hearth to relight his lamp.

**Chapter XVII: In which are contained the innumerable troubles which the brave Don Quixote and his good squire Sancho Panza endured in the inn, which to his misfortune he took to be a castle**
Don Quixote recovers from his swoon and calls to Sancho. Sancho complains of being tormented. Don Quixote affirms the ""castle"" is enchanted, and tells Sancho (under a vow of secrecy) that the daughter of the ""lord of this castle"" had visited him, and he was struck by a ""huge giant's"" hand for his fidelity to Dulcinea. Sancho reveals he also was beaten by ""four hundred Moors"" and questions the value of such ""rare adventures."" Don Quixote promises to make the balsam of Fierabras to cure them.

The officer enters with his lit lamp. Sancho mistakes him for the enchanted Moor. Don Quixote insists enchanted beings are invisible. The officer, seeing Don Quixote's condition, asks how he is. Don Quixote, offended by his tone, insults him. The officer, enraged, strikes Don Quixote on the head with the lamp, breaking his pate, and then leaves in the dark. Sancho attributes this to the enchanted Moor. Don Quixote agrees and tells Sancho to fetch ingredients for the balsam (oil, wine, salt, rosemary) to heal his wound.

Sancho, in pain, finds the innkeeper, who provides the items. Don Quixote, realizing his ""blood"" was sweat, mixes the concoction and recites prayers over it. He drinks a large portion, then immediately vomits profusely and sweats, but afterwards feels greatly relieved and cured. He believes he has discovered the balsam of Fierabras. Sancho,"
Dracula-Bram Stoker,"The plot of the provided text, ""DRACULA,"" unfolds primarily through journal entries, letters, and newspaper clippings, detailing the supernatural encounters of a group of English individuals.

The story begins on **May 3rd** with Jonathan Harker, a solicitor, traveling through Eastern Europe to Transylvania to finalize a real estate transaction for a nobleman named Count Dracula. He notes the exotic nature of the region and the locals' superstitions. At Bistritz, the innkeepers become visibly frightened when he mentions Count Dracula and his castle, crossing themselves and urging him not to go, particularly as it is the eve of St. George's Day, when evil spirits are said to have power. An old woman gives him a crucifix for protection.

On **May 5th**, Harker's journey to the Borgo Pass is marked by the passengers' fearful gestures against the evil eye. At the Pass, a mysterious, tall, strong man with a long beard, bright red eyes, and sharp white teeth, who Harker later suspects is Count Dracula himself, arrives in a calèche to collect him. The journey to the castle is terrifying, with howling dogs and wolves. The driver repeatedly stops to investigate flickering blue flames, which Dracula later explains mark hidden treasure. Harker observes the driver's unnatural strength and the wolves' obedience to his command. They finally arrive at a vast, ruined castle.

Harker enters the castle and meets Count Dracula, who is a tall, old man with an aquiline nose, prominent sharp white teeth, and extreme pallor. His handshake is cold and unnaturally strong. Dracula shows Harker to his room and reveals his desire to learn English customs and intonation, asking Harker to extend his stay for a month. Harker notices Dracula has no reflection in a mirror, and his eyes blaze with fury when Harker cuts himself shaving, causing Dracula to smash the mirror. Harker discovers he is a prisoner in the castle, with all doors locked. He observes Dracula performing menial tasks, confirming there are no servants, which implies Dracula was the coachman who controlled the wolves.

Dracula reveals his Szekely lineage, boasting of his ancestors' warlike nature and connection to figures like Attila. Harker later finds a map in Dracula's library with marked locations: his new London estate (Carfax, near Purfleet), Exeter (Harker's employer's location), and Whitby. Dracula expresses a preference for old, large houses and ancient chapels for his ""bones,"" hinting at a desire to escape the common dead.

Harker attempts to send letters home, but Dracula intercepts one written in shorthand, burning it with a look of ""wicked fury,"" and warning Harker not to sleep in other parts of the castle. Disobeying this, Harker explores and finds an old wing. There, he witnesses three beautiful, ghostly women who cast no shadows. They attempt to kiss him, but Dracula intervenes, claiming Harker belongs to him. The women then ask if they will get ""nothing to-night,"" and Dracula nods towards a moving bag, from which a child's cry is heard before the women and bag vanish. Harker falls unconscious.

Harker later discovers his traveling clothes and papers are gone. He sees the Count leave the castle in his clothes, lizard-like down the wall, realizing Dracula intends to impersonate him and use his identity for evil deeds. He then hears a woman's agonized cry in the courtyard, demanding her child from the ""monster,"" followed by wolf howls, and then silence, with the wolves licking their lips. Harker, horrified, resolves to escape. He scales the castle wall, enters Dracula's room, finds a heap of ancient gold, and descends to a ruined chapel. There, he finds Dracula lying in an earth-filled wooden box, looking younger and gorged with fresh blood. Harker strikes Dracula's face with a shovel, causing a gash, but is paralyzed by his ""basilisk horror."" He flees, as gypsy wagons arrive to transport the boxes. He attempts to escape through the main door, but it is locked. He overhears Dracula telling the three women that ""To-night is mine. To-morrow night is yours!"" He realizes he is trapped and plans to leap from the precipice, writing his last goodbyes to his fiancée, Mina.

Meanwhile, in England, Mina Murray, Harker's fiancée, is in Whitby with her friend Lucy Westenra. Lucy receives three marriage proposals in one day from Dr. John Seward, Mr. Quincey P. Morris, and finally, her beloved Arthur Holmwood. Dr. Seward, a director of a lunatic asylum, records his observations of a patient named Renfield, a ""zoöphagous maniac"" who consumes flies, spiders, and birds in a cumulative effort to absorb ""life."" Renfield often speaks of ""the Master"" and has periods of violent excitement linked to the moon and the arrival of a mysterious influence.

Lucy's health deteriorates. She experiences sleepwalking episodes, found by Mina on a cliff, and develops two small, unhealing puncture marks on her throat. Mina and her mother notice Lucy's increasing pallor and weakness. A Russian ship, the _Demeter_, carrying fifty boxes of earth from Varna to Whitby, is caught in a terrible storm and miraculously enters the harbor. Its dead captain is found lashed to the helm, holding a crucifix. His log details the disappearance of his crew members one by one and the presence of a mysterious tall, thin man on board. An immense dog leaps from the ship and vanishes into the town. The body of Mr. Swales, the old sailor, is found with a broken neck and a look of fear. A large mastiff is found dead with its throat torn.

Mina receives a letter from Jonathan in Buda-Pesth, stating he has been ill with brain fever and remembers nothing of his ordeal. They marry there. Mina, concerned by Jonathan's memory loss and the strange man he saw in London (who Jonathan believes is the Count, looking younger), begins to transcribe their journals.

Lucy's condition worsens, becoming ""ghastly pale."" Dr. Seward calls in his former mentor, Professor Van Helsing, a specialist in ""obscure diseases."" Van Helsing quickly identifies Lucy's critical blood loss and performs multiple blood transfusions, with Arthur Holmwood, Seward, and Quincey Morris all donating. He notes the puncture marks on Lucy's throat and hisses with apprehension. Mrs. Westenra, Lucy's mother, unknowingly thwarts Van Helsing's protective measures by removing garlic flowers from Lucy's room and opening a window, leading to Lucy's rapid decline.

Lucy's final moments are marked by a ""sleep-waking"" state where she asks Arthur to kiss her with a ""voluptuous voice."" Van Helsing violently pulls Arthur back, declaring, ""Not for your life! not for your living soul and hers!"" Lucy dies, but her body retains an unnatural beauty. Van Helsing asserts that her death is ""only the beginning.""

A newspaper reports children in Hampstead being lured away by a ""bloofer lady"" and found with small, punctured throat wounds. Van Helsing reveals to Seward that these wounds were made by Lucy herself, who has become ""Un-Dead."" He explains the nature of vampires: immortal beings who prey on the living, turning their victims into new Un-Dead. He proposes to ""kill"" the Un-Dead Lucy by staking her heart, decapitating her, and filling her mouth with garlic, to free her soul. Arthur, heartbroken, agrees to strike the blow.

In Lucy's tomb, they find the coffin empty, but Van Helsing reveals he had placed Host (consecrated wafer) in the tomb, which temporarily prevented her from leaving. They hide and observe. Lucy, now a ""dark-haired woman, dressed in the cerements of the grave,"" with crimson lips, approaches the tomb, carrying a child. She flings the child away with ""heartless cruelty"" and attempts to lure Arthur, her ""husband,"" to her. Van Helsing repels her with a crucifix, and she recoils, demonstrating ""baffled malice"" before dematerializing through a small crack into her tomb.

The next night, Arthur drives a stake through Lucy's heart, decapitates her, and fills her mouth with garlic. Her body writhes and then crumbles to dust, and a look of peace finally rests on her face. Her soul is free. The group pledges to hunt down the source of this evil, Count Dracula.

The team discovers that Dracula has relocated fifty boxes of earth (his ""lairs"") to various London properties he purchased: Carfax, Mile End, Bermondsey, and a house in Piccadilly. They systematically sterilize the earth in each box with consecrated Host, destroying Dracula's refuges. During their raid on the Piccadilly house, Dracula appears, looking younger. Jonathan attacks him with a Kukri knife, causing Dracula to recoil, revealing his money and gold. As the men confront him with crucifixes, Dracula turns into a ""faint vapour"" and escapes through a window into the stable, shouting threats about his revenge and claiming the ""girls that you all love are mine already.""

Mina, bearing a searing mark on her forehead from a Sacred Wafer (placed there by Van Helsing to protect her, but causing her pain as she is now partially tainted by Dracula's blood), reveals that Dracula has given her his ""baptism of blood,"" connecting her to him. She fears she will become Un-Dead if he is not destroyed and makes her friends promise to kill her if this occurs. She also discovers that she can be hypnotized by Van Helsing to reveal Dracula's current location and movements through their shared connection.

Through Mina's trance, they learn Dracula has fled London by ship, the _Czarina Catherine_, bound for Galatz, and then up the Danube to his castle in Transylvania. They realize Dracula has killed his agent, Skinsky, in Galatz to cover his tracks. The group divides: Lord Godalming and Jonathan Harker pursue Dracula by steam launch up the river, while Dr. Seward and Quincey Morris follow by land with horses. Van Helsing takes Mina into the heart of Transylvania, to Castle Dracula, believing her hypnotic abilities will guide them.

As they converge on Dracula, Mina's hypnotic reports become more fragmented, reflecting her weakening resistance to Dracula's influence. Van Helsing realizes Dracula is rushing to reach his castle before sunset, as he is most powerful there. He finds the three women vampires in the castle's tombs and, after a moment of intense temptation from their beauty, destroys them with stakes and decapitation, causing their bodies to crumble to dust.

Finally, the group intercepts Dracula's wagon, driven by gypsies, as it races towards the castle at sunset. Jonathan Harker and Quincey Morris leap onto the wagon and open Dracula's last earth-box. Just as the sun dips below the horizon, Jonathan's Kukri knife shears through Dracula's throat, and Quincey's bowie knife plunges into his heart. Dracula's body instantly crumbles to dust, leaving behind a look of peace. Quincey Morris, gravely wounded during the struggle, dies with a smile, saying the ""curse has passed away"" from Mina, whose forehead is now clear of the scar. The narrative concludes with the remaining heroes victorious but saddened by their losses."
Frankenstein-Mary Shelley,"This detailed plot summary will strictly adhere to the provided text, without incorporating any external knowledge of the book ""Frankenstein.""

The story begins with **Robert Walton**, a captain on an expedition to the North Pole, writing letters to his sister, Mrs. Saville, in England. In his first letter (December 11th, 17—), Walton expresses his exhilaration for his perilous journey of discovery to the ""icy climes"" of the pole, hoping to discover scientific secrets, find new lands, or locate a passage. He recounts his past desire for a seafaring life, forbidden by his father, and his subsequent studies in science, mathematics, and medicine, preparing himself for the hardships of such an enterprise. He mentions having accompanied whale-fishers and serving on Greenland whalers, gaining practical experience and commendation. He aims for glory over luxury but admits to fluctuating hopes and periods of depression.

In his second letter (March 28th, 17—), from Archangel, Walton reports having secured a vessel and brave sailors. He expresses a profound loneliness and longing for a true friend, someone who could sympathize with his intellectual aspirations. He describes his capable lieutenant and his gentle, courageous master, relating the master's past selfless act of giving his fortune to allow the woman he loved to marry a poorer man she truly desired. Walton reasserts his fixed resolve for the voyage, delayed only by severe winter weather, and alludes to the ""Ancient Mariner,"" hoping to avoid a similar fate. He hints at a love for the ""marvellous"" that drives him beyond common paths.

By July 7th, 17— (Letter 3), Walton is well advanced on his voyage, with bold men and good spirits, despite floating ice sheets. He mentions minor incidents like gales and a leak and expresses confidence in his ultimate success, believing nothing can stop the determined will of man.

On August 5th, 17— (Letter 4), Walton recounts a strange event. On July 31st, while their ship was surrounded by ice and fog, they saw a gigantic, man-shaped being guiding a dog-drawn sledge northward across the ice. Later, after the ice broke, they found another sledge drifting towards them with a nearly frozen, emaciated European man inside. This stranger, after being revived, insisted on knowing their destination before boarding. Upon hearing they were bound for the northern pole, he consented. Walton nursed him, observing his deep melancholy mixed with moments of benevolence. The stranger revealed he was pursuing someone. When the lieutenant mentioned seeing a similar sledge with a man the day before, the stranger became animated, asking many questions about the ""dæmon's"" route. Walton developed a deep sympathy for the stranger, whom he considers a potential friend.

On August 13th, the stranger's grief overwhelmed him when Walton spoke of his own ardent pursuit of knowledge, exclaiming, ""Unhappy man! Do you share my madness?"" He then promised to reveal his tale as a moral lesson for Walton, stating his own ""fate is nearly fulfilled"" and ""nothing can alter my destiny."" On August 19th, the stranger, whom Walton now refers to as **Frankenstein**, began his ""strange and harrowing"" narrative.

**Victor Frankenstein's Narrative (Chapters 1-24):**

Victor Frankenstein, a Genevese, describes his esteemed family. His father, Alphonse, married Caroline Beaufort, the orphaned daughter of a proud merchant friend who had fallen into poverty and died. Caroline was rescued by Alphonse and two years later became his wife. Victor was born in Naples, their eldest child, showered with affection. At age five, his mother, remembering her own benevolent rescue, brought Elizabeth Lavenza, a beautiful orphan of Milanese nobility, into their family. Elizabeth became Victor's adored ""more than sister.""

Victor and Elizabeth grew up together. Elizabeth was calm, but Victor was consumed by a ""thirst for knowledge,"" specifically the ""secrets of heaven and earth."" Their younger brother, Ernest, was born seven years after Victor. Victor also formed a close friendship with Henry Clerval, a boy of talent who loved chivalry and dreamed of being a benefactor of mankind. Elizabeth, with her saintly soul, softened Victor's vehement passions.

At thirteen, Victor discovered books by Cornelius Agrippa, Paracelsus, and Albertus Magnus, becoming engrossed in alchemy and the pursuit of the philosopher's stone and the elixir of life, dreaming of banishing disease and raising the dead. His father dismissed these studies. At fifteen, a violent thunderstorm shattered an oak, prompting a lecture on electricity and galvanism that made his former pursuits seem ""despicable."" He then turned to mathematics. He reflects that this change was a failed attempt by a ""guardian angel"" to avert his ""utter and terrible destruction.""

At seventeen, Victor's parents sent him to the University of Ingolstadt. Before his departure, Elizabeth fell ill with scarlet fever. His mother, nursing Elizabeth, contracted the disease and died, first joining Victor and Elizabeth's hands and expressing her hope for their union. Victor was deeply grieved. His departure was delayed, as he found it sacrilegious to leave the house of mourning and desired to see Elizabeth consoled. Elizabeth bravely comforted the family. Clerval, whose father forbade him to study with Victor, reluctantly bid him farewell.

At Ingolstadt, Professor Krempe, a natural philosophy professor, mocked Victor's prior studies. However, Professor Waldman, a chemistry professor, delivered a lecture extolling the ""almost unlimited powers"" of modern chemistry and its capacity to penetrate nature's deepest mysteries. This lecture ignited Victor's ambition: to ""pioneer a new way, explore unknown powers, and unfold to the world the deepest mysteries of creation."" He decided to devote himself to science, and Waldman became his mentor.

For two years, Victor immersed himself in natural philosophy and chemistry, making rapid progress and gaining esteem. He became fascinated by the ""principle of life"" and the structure of the human frame. He delved into physiology and anatomy, spending days and nights in vaults and charnel-houses, observing decay. Through ""incredible labour,"" he discovered the cause of life and became capable of ""bestowing animation upon lifeless matter."" He refuses to reveal this secret to Walton, warning of the dangers of knowledge.

Victor resolved to create a human being. Due to the minuteness of parts, he decided to make the being of gigantic stature, about eight feet tall. He spent months collecting materials from dissecting rooms and slaughter-houses. Driven by a ""frantic impulse"" and the dream of a ""new species,"" he neglected his health and family, becoming pale, emaciated, nervous, and shunned by others. He knew his father would be concerned by his silence but could not tear himself away from his ""loathsome"" work. He believed the pursuit of knowledge should not destroy affections.

On a ""dreary night of November,"" Victor completed his creation. By the glimmer of a dying candle, he saw the creature's ""dull yellow eye"" open, it breathed, and its limbs convulsed. The beauty he had envisioned vanished, replaced by ""breathless horror and disgust"" at its hideous appearance. He fled the room, tormented by nightmares, one of which involved Elizabeth turning into his dead mother's corpse, crawling with worms. He awoke to see the ""miserable monster"" standing over his bed, its hand outstretched. He escaped into the courtyard.

The next morning, wandering Ingolstadt's streets, he encountered Henry Clerval, who had arrived to study. Victor was overjoyed, momentarily forgetting his horror. Clerval noted Victor's ill appearance. Victor, fearing the creature was still in his apartment, rushed back to find it empty, clapping his hands in relief. However, he then descended into a nervous frenzy, laughing wildly, until he imagined the monster and fell into a fit.

This triggered a nervous fever that lasted months, during which Clerval was his devoted nurse, concealing the severity of his illness from his family. Victor raved, calling himself a murderer. As he slowly recovered, Elizabeth's letter arrived, expressing anxiety and relaying news of their family. She described Justine Moritz, a beloved servant raised in their home, and William, their youngest brother.

Victor, though recovering, retained a violent antipathy to natural philosophy. He was tormented by professors' praise for his past scientific achievements, especially M. Waldman's, but Clerval protected him by changing the subject. To escape his thoughts, Victor joined Clerval in studying oriental languages.

His return to Geneva was delayed until spring. Clerval proposed a walking tour of Ingolstadt's environs. The beauty of nature and Clerval's companionship restored Victor's health and spirits.

Upon their return, Victor received a letter from his father informing him of William's murder. William's body was found in Plainpalais, with the ""print of the murder's finger"" on his neck, and a miniature of Victor's mother, which Elizabeth had given William, was missing. Elizabeth blamed herself. Victor's father urged him to return to console Elizabeth.

On his journey to Geneva, Victor was overcome by grief and fear. He stopped at Secheron. Unable to rest, he visited the murder spot in Plainpalais during a violent thunderstorm. Amidst the lightning, he saw the ""gigantic stature"" and ""deformity"" of the creature he had made. Victor was instantly convinced the creature was William's murderer. He considered revealing his knowledge but feared being considered mad, so he resolved to remain silent.

At his father's house, Ernest informed him that Justine Moritz was accused of William's murder. A servant had found the miniature in Justine's pocket. Victor, convinced of Justine's innocence, knew the truth but still could not reveal it. Elizabeth also vehemently believed in Justine's innocence.

At the trial, Justine, despite maintaining her innocence and explaining her movements on the night of the murder (she had searched for William, found the city gates shut, and spent the night in a barn), was condemned by circumstantial evidence and her own confused demeanor. Elizabeth made a passionate appeal for Justine's character, but public indignation turned against Justine, accusing her of ingratitude. Victor was consumed by anguish, believing himself the true murderer.

Justine, awaiting execution, confessed to the crime, but only because her confessor had threatened her with excommunication and hell fire if she remained ""obdurate."" She wept, asserting her innocence to Elizabeth and Victor. Victor, though speechless, knew her innocence. Justine expressed resignation to her fate, hoping to be remembered as unjustly condemned. The next day, Justine was executed.

Victor was plunged into profound despair and remorse, shunning society. He contemplated suicide but was restrained by thoughts of Elizabeth, his father, and Ernest, whom he feared leaving unprotected from the fiend. He longed to avenge William and Justine. His father's health declined, and Elizabeth, too, was consumed by grief, viewing the world as full of vice and injustice, but still believed Justine innocent. Victor recognized his own responsibility for their suffering.

He sought solace in the Alpine valleys of Chamounix. There, amidst the glaciers, he encountered the creature he had made. Victor, enraged, called him ""Devil"" and ""vile insect,"" attempting to attack him. The creature easily eluded him, then calmly articulated his misery, rejection, and hatred. He reminded Victor of his duty as a creator and threatened further vengeance upon Victor's remaining friends if Victor refused his demands. He declared, ""misery made me a fiend. Make me happy, and I shall again be virtuous."" He demanded Victor create a female companion, ""one as deformed and horrible as myself,"" with whom he could live in the ""vast wilds of South America,"" far from mankind.

Victor was torn. He abhorred the creature but felt some justice in its plea, recognizing his duty as its maker. He feared the creation of a second monster would lead to a ""race of devils"" that would endanger mankind. However, considering the creature's formidable power and his fear for his family, Victor finally consented to create a female, extracting a solemn oath from the creature to quit Europe forever upon receiving his companion. The creature then departed with ""superhuman speed.""

Victor returned to Geneva, his family alarmed by his haggard appearance. He resolved to dedicate himself to this ""abhorred task"" to save them. Weeks passed, but Victor could not bring himself to recommence his work. His health improved, but his father, observing his continued melancholy, mistakenly thought Victor had an attachment other than Elizabeth or was reluctant to marry her. Victor reassured his father of his love for Elizabeth and agreed to an immediate marriage to dissipate his father's worries. However, in his mind, he believed he must first fulfill his promise to the monster to secure his family's safety.

To pursue the necessary scientific knowledge away from his loved ones, Victor proposed a journey to England, concealing his true reasons. His father agreed, hoping the change would restore him, and arranged for Clerval to join him in Strasburgh. Victor, though desiring solitude, welcomed Clerval's companionship as a temporary distraction. He arranged for his chemical instruments to be packed. He feared the monster might harm his family during his absence but believed the fiend would follow him.

Victor and Clerval travelled through Europe, descending the Rhine and eventually arriving in London. Clerval enjoyed the journey, but Victor remained haunted by his task and the memories of William and Justine. He began collecting materials for the female creature, finding it a torture.

After months in London, they travelled to Scotland. Victor decided to separate from Clerval to finish his work in solitude, choosing a remote Orkney Island as his laboratory. There, in a miserable hut, he toiled, finding the work ""more horrible and irksome"" than before, his heart sickened by the ""filthy process."" He feared the monster's imminent appearance.

One evening, reflecting on the potential consequences, Victor realized the new female creature might be even more malicious, refuse the compact, or reproduce a ""race of devils"" that would doom humanity. He decided he had no right to inflict such a curse on future generations. At that moment, he looked up to see the ""dæmon"" at the casement, grinning. Seeing the creature's malice, Victor, in a fit of ""madness,"" tore the half-finished female to pieces. The creature howled in ""devilish despair and revenge"" and withdrew. Victor vowed never to resume his labors.

Later that night, the creature entered Victor's room, expressing his toil and suffering in following Victor. He accused Victor of breaking his promise and threatened, ""I will be with you on your wedding-night!"" Victor, interpreting this as a threat to his own life, resolved to face him.

He received a letter from Clerval, urging him to join him in Perth to prepare for a voyage to India. Victor packed his chemical instruments and the destroyed creature's remains, intending to sink them in the sea. He sailed out and cast the basket of remains into the sea.

Caught in a storm, Victor drifted for hours, enduring hunger and thirst, when he was rescued by Walton's vessel. He was then accused of murder upon landing in Ireland. Brought before a magistrate, Mr. Kirwin, he was shown the body of the victim, who turned out to be Henry Clerval, strangled with the ""mark of fingers"" on his neck. Victor, overwhelmed, fell into convulsions, crying out that he was the murderer of William, Justine, and Clerval.

Victor suffered a two-month fever, raving in his native language (understood by Kirwin) about his crimes and the fiend. Kirwin, showing kindness, sent for Victor's father. Victor's father arrived, reassuring him of Elizabeth and Ernest's safety, but the mention of Clerval caused Victor fresh tears.

Victor was imprisoned, considered mad, but eventually cleared of Clerval's murder after it was proven he was on the Orkney Islands at the time. His father was overjoyed, but Victor was consumed by a black melancholy. He returned to Geneva, resolved to avenge his loved ones and destroy the monster.

His father soon died in his arms, overcome by the accumulated horrors. Victor was again deemed mad and imprisoned for months. When reason returned, so did his thirst for revenge. He accused the monster to a criminal judge, relating his entire history. The magistrate, initially incredulous, promised to help but doubted the feasibility of apprehending such a powerful and elusive being. Victor, seeing the magistrate's disbelief, resolved to pursue the monster alone.

Victor then describes his long, arduous pursuit of the creature across Europe, Tartary, and Russia, guided by hints left by the creature, who feared Victor would die if he lost the trail. Victor endured extreme cold, hunger, and fatigue, sustained only by thoughts of revenge and dreams of his loved ones. The monster left taunting messages, boasting of his impassivity to cold and Victor's impending suffering.

Finally, Victor caught up to the creature in the Arctic, gaining on him with a sledge and dogs. He saw the creature a mile away, but then a ground sea split the ice, separating them. Victor was left drifting on a diminishing ice raft, facing death, when he saw Walton's ship. He made his way to the vessel, exhausted, believing his task unfulfilled and desiring Walton to complete it. He implores Walton to swear to destroy the creature if it ever appears after his death, warning him against its persuasive eloquence.

**Walton's Continuation and Conclusion (September 2nd-12th, 17—):**

Walton continues his letters, describing Frankenstein's continued anguish and his corrections to Walton's notes of his story. Walton is deeply affected by Frankenstein's narrative and his noble character even in ruin. Frankenstein, convinced his purpose is to destroy the monster, repulses Walton's attempts to reconcile him to life.

On September 2nd, Walton reports their ship is still surrounded by crushing ice, with many crew members dead. He fears a mutiny and worries about his sister's despair if he is lost. Frankenstein, though ill, tries to inspire Walton with hope.

On September 5th, a mutiny is brewing. Sailors demand Walton promise to turn south if freed from the ice. Frankenstein, roused, gives an impassioned speech, shaming them for their ""cowardice"" and urging them to be ""heroes"" who face danger for glory and mankind's benefit. The men are moved. Walton tells them to reflect.

On September 7th, Walton has ""consented to return,"" his hopes for discovery ""blasted by cowardice and indecision.""

On September 9th, the ice breaks. On the 11th, a passage south opens. The sailors cheer. Frankenstein, learning they are returning, is dismayed. He tries to spring from his bed, asserting his divine purpose to pursue the monster, but collapses and faints. The surgeon reports he has only hours to live.

Frankenstein, on his deathbed, tells Walton that he now believes he was justified in refusing to create a companion for the creature, as his duties to his own species were paramount. He describes the creature's ""unparalleled malignity"" and renews his request for Walton to destroy the monster. He advises Walton to ""Seek happiness in tranquillity and avoid ambition."" He then dies peacefully, with a gentle smile.

Walton, deeply saddened, is interrupted by a sound from the cabin where Frankenstein's body lies. He enters to find the gigantic monster hanging over Frankenstein's coffin, expressing anguish. The monster exclaims, ""That is also my victim! In his murder my crimes are consummated!"" Walton's initial impulse to destroy the fiend is replaced by curiosity and compassion.

Walton confronts the monster, pointing out the futility of his repentance. The monster responds that Frankenstein suffered only a fraction of his own anguish. He recounts his heartbreak after Clerval's murder and how Frankenstein's hopes for happiness, while he himself was excluded, fueled his ""insatiable thirst for vengeance."" He declares, ""Evil thenceforth became my good,"" and that the completion of his ""demoniacal design became an insatiable passion."" He concludes, ""And now it is ended; there is my last victim!""

Walton accuses the monster of hypocrisy. The monster denies it, stating he does not seek sympathy in his misery, only acknowledges that he once sought love and happiness but found only abhorrence. He asserts that all humankind sinned against him, citing Felix's and the rustic's cruel treatment. He admits his wretchedness and crimes, but says his ""agony was still superior"" to Frankenstein's due to remorse.

The monster assures Walton he will not cause further mischief. His ""work is nearly complete""; he will travel to the ""most northern extremity of the globe,"" build a ""funeral pile,"" and consume his body to ashes, leaving no remains for anyone to repeat Frankenstein's creation. He finds death his only consolation. He bids farewell to Walton, the ""last of humankind whom these eyes will ever behold,"" then springs from the cabin window onto the ice raft and is quickly borne away into darkness and distance."
Great Expectations-Charles Dickens,"The story begins with Pip, an orphan, introducing himself and his deceased family members through their tombstones in a bleak churchyard on the marsh country. While visiting the graves, a fearful, coarse-looking man with an iron on his leg emerges and threatens to kill Pip. The man demands Pip's name, where he lives, a file, and food (""wittles"") by the next morning at the old Battery. He warns Pip not to tell anyone, claiming a ""young man"" is with him who would cut out Pip's heart and liver if he failed or spoke of their meeting. Terrified, Pip promises to steal the items.

Pip lives with his much older, bad-tempered sister, Mrs. Joe Gargery, who raised him ""by hand"" (implying physical abuse), and her kind, mild-mannered husband, Joe Gargery, the blacksmith. Mrs. Joe is physically and verbally abusive to both Pip and Joe. Pip, burdened by his promise, steals bread, cheese, mincemeat, brandy, a meat bone, and a pork pie from the pantry, and a file from Joe's forge.

The next morning, in a thick mist, Pip heads to the Battery. He first encounters another man, also wearing an iron, whom he mistakenly thinks is the first man. This ""young man"" jumps up, swings at Pip, and then stumbles away. Pip soon finds the first convict, Magwitch, who is shivering and hungry. Pip gives him the stolen items, which Magwitch devours. Magwitch questions Pip about being alone, then, upon hearing Pip saw the ""young man,"" becomes agitated and furiously files at his leg iron. Pip, frightened, slips away.

Later that day, Christmas, soldiers arrive at Joe's house, requesting Joe to mend a pair of handcuffs. The sergeant mentions they are hunting two escaped convicts on the marshes. Joe repairs the handcuffs. Pip, Joe, Mr. Wopsle (the church clerk), and Uncle Pumblechook (Mrs. Joe's uncle, a cornchandler) gather for Christmas dinner. Pumblechook and Mrs. Joe constantly lecture Pip on gratitude and his low status. Mrs. Joe serves brandy, which Pip has refilled with tar-water. Pumblechook drinks it and has a violent reaction, gasping ""Tar!"" Pip is horrified, thinking he has poisoned him. Later, as Mrs. Joe prepares to serve a pork pie, Pip realizes it's the one he stole and, in terror, runs, only to be met at the door by the soldiers. He realizes the handcuffs are not for him.

Pip, Joe, Mr. Wopsle, and the soldiers go to the marshes. They hear shouts and discover the two convicts fighting in a ditch. Pip's convict, Magwitch, claims he captured the other, Compeyson, who had previously tried to murder him. Compeyson, bruised, accuses Magwitch of attempted murder. Magwitch is re-manacled and taken to a prison-ship (Hulk). Before being taken, Magwitch confesses to stealing food from the blacksmith's. Joe, touched by Magwitch's misery, tells him he's welcome to the food, revealing his profound kindness.

Pip is freed from suspicion but burdened by guilt. He struggles with telling Joe the truth, fearing to lose his friend's confidence. Joe, meanwhile, tells the curious villagers that the convict broke in through the chimney. Mrs. Joe is seriously injured and becomes an invalid, only able to communicate by writing on a slate. Biddy, Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt's granddaughter, comes to live with them and becomes Mrs. Joe's caregiver, translating her slate writings. Biddy realizes Mrs. Joe's cryptic ""T"" drawing signifies Orlick, Joe's journeyman, by his hammer. Mrs. Joe, to Pip's surprise, treats Orlick with a strange ""humble propitiation.""

Pip's apprenticeship continues, marked by annual visits to Miss Havisham. He feels ashamed of his common life and secretly desires to become a gentleman for Estella. Biddy, who has become refined and intelligent, tries to dissuade him, suggesting he is happier as he is. Pip, impatient, accuses her of envy. One day, Miss Havisham tells Pip his apprenticeship to Joe should begin immediately. Miss Havisham then provides 25 guineas for Pip's apprenticeship, implying no further favors. Joe, who accompanies Pip, refuses any personal compensation, emphasizing his friendship with Pip. Pumblechook, however, claims credit for Pip's good fortune. Pip is formally bound to Joe.

Pip becomes ashamed of his home and Joe, feeling his ""great expectations"" separate him. He confides in Biddy, who correctly identifies his desire to impress Estella as the root of his discontent. Estella, however, is being educated abroad.

Years later, while Pip is listening to Mr. Wopsle read a murder trial in a pub, Mr. Jaggers, a London lawyer, enters. Jaggers, whom Pip recognizes as the man from Miss Havisham's, questions Wopsle's legal understanding. Jaggers then announces that Pip has ""great expectations"" and will come into a ""handsome property,"" to be brought up as a gentleman. He reveals he is Pip's guardian, and Pip is to receive a substantial annual income until the anonymous benefactor reveals themselves. Pip is strictly forbidden from inquiring about his patron. Jaggers recommends Mr. Matthew Pocket (Miss Havisham's cousin) as Pip's tutor. Pip assumes Miss Havisham is his benefactor. Joe, overwhelmed, emotionally refuses any money for Pip's lost services, declaring their enduring friendship. Pip leaves for London, feeling both excitement and a deep sense of separation from Joe and his past.

In London, Pip finds Barnard's Inn dingy and disappointing. He meets Herbert Pocket, who he recognizes as the ""pale young gentleman"" he fought in Miss Havisham's garden. They become close friends. Herbert reveals Miss Havisham's tragic story: she was jilted on her wedding day by a man named Compeyson, who conspired with her half-brother Arthur. This led her to stop all clocks and live in eternal decay. Estella is Miss Havisham's adopted daughter, raised to break men's hearts. Herbert, a hopeful but financially struggling capitalist, becomes Pip's confidant and friend.

Pip and Herbert accumulate debts. Pip learns from Wemmick, Jaggers's clerk, about Jaggers's dual personality: a ruthless lawyer in the city and a kind, eccentric man at his ""Castle"" home in Walworth, where he cares for his deaf ""Aged Parent"" and has a fiancée, Miss Skiffins. Wemmick advises Pip to keep his office and private lives separate.

Pip receives a letter from Trabb & Co. announcing Mrs. Joe's death. He returns home for the funeral. He is deeply moved by the quiet ceremony and feels remorse for his ingratitude to Joe and Biddy. Pumblechook, still self-important, tries to claim credit for Pip's fortunes. Pip learns from Biddy that his sister, in her last conscious moments, spoke ""Joe,"" ""Pardon,"" and ""Pip."" He also learns that Orlick was the one who attacked Mrs. Joe, using Magwitch's filed-off leg-iron, and is now in jail. Biddy reveals she is leaving to become a schoolmistress and will care for Joe.

Later, Pip is disturbed to learn from Mr. Wopsle that Compeyson was seen behind him at the theatre. Pip writes to Wemmick, communicating this danger.

At a dinner at Jaggers's house, Pip, Herbert, Startop, and Drummle are present. Jaggers reveals that Drummle is pursuing Estella. Jaggers compels his housekeeper, Molly, to show her scarred wrists. Pip realizes Molly is Estella's mother, a woman acquitted of murder, defended by Jaggers. Jaggers subtly implies he orchestrated Estella's adoption to save her from a life of crime, given her background.

Pip learns Estella is engaged to Drummle. He confronts her, confessing his love and pleading with her not to marry Drummle, a ""brute."" Estella coldly states she has ""no heart"" and will marry Drummle to change her life. She reminds Pip that she is what Miss Havisham made her. Pip leaves Satis House, devastated. He then receives a cryptic note from Wemmick: ""DON'T GO HOME.""

Pip, following Wemmick's warning, stays at a hotel. He learns from Wemmick that Provis's chambers are being watched by Compeyson, who is in London. Herbert, alerted by Pip's note, moves Provis to a secluded lodging on Mill Pond Bank under the alias Mr. Campbell, with Herbert's fiancée Clara and her father, Mr. Barley. Wemmick advises Pip to obtain passports and prepare for Provis's escape from England.

Pip, receiving a mysterious anonymous note to meet at the sluice-house for information about ""your uncle Provis,"" goes to the marshes. He is ambushed by Orlick, who ties him up and reveals he was the lurker on Pip's stairs and the one who attacked Mrs. Joe, blaming Pip for his misfortunes. Orlick declares his intention to kill Pip and dispose of his body in the limekiln. Just as Orlick is about to strike, Herbert and Startop, guided by Trabb's Boy (who had found Pip's dropped letter), burst in and save Pip.

Pip, Herbert, and Startop then put their plan for Magwitch's escape into action. They row Magwitch down the Thames. They are intercepted by a four-oared galley carrying Custom House officers and Compeyson, who has been working with them. In the ensuing struggle, Magwitch and Compeyson both fall overboard. Magwitch is rescued but severely injured. Compeyson is not found. Magwitch is manacled and taken back to London for trial. Pip's repugnance for Magwitch vanishes, replaced by affection and loyalty.

Magwitch is tried and found guilty, sentenced to death. Pip visits him daily in the infirmary, tending to him and writing petitions. As Magwitch is dying, Pip reveals to him that his child (Estella) is alive, beautiful, a lady, and that Pip loves her. Magwitch, with a last smile, raises Pip's hand to his lips and dies peacefully. Pip prays, ""O Lord, be merciful to him a sinner!""

Pip falls ill with a fever and is arrested for debt. He is nursed back to health by Joe, who has come to London and paid off Pip's debts. Pip, realizing his ingratitude and Joe's unwavering love, is humbled. He learns that Miss Havisham has died, leaving most of her property to Estella, but also four thousand pounds to Mr. Matthew Pocket due to Pip's account of his goodness.

Pip returns to the forge, intending to propose to Biddy and work with Joe. However, he finds Joe and Biddy are married. He gives them his blessing and resolves to leave England to work off his debts and find his own way. He liquidates his remaining assets, pays his creditors, and joins Herbert in Cairo, becoming a clerk and eventually a partner in Clarriker and Co.

Eleven years later, Pip returns to his native village. He finds Joe and Biddy have a child named Pip. He revisits the site of Satis House, now demolished except for the garden wall, and finds Estella there. She is greatly changed, her beauty softened by suffering. She reveals she had an unhappy marriage with Drummle (implied), who has since died. She tells Pip that suffering has taught her to understand his heart. They acknowledge their enduring friendship, and Pip sees ""no shadow of another parting from her."""
Hamlet-William Shakespeare,"This detailed summary is based solely on the provided text, without any external knowledge or interpretation.

**Act I**

**Scene I: Elsinore. A Platform Before the Castle. Night.**
The play opens on a cold night at the castle platform in Elsinore, Denmark. Bernardo relieves Francisco from his guard duty. Bernardo, joined by Horatio and Marcellus, discusses a strange apparition they have witnessed on the previous two nights. Horatio, a scholar, is skeptical and believes it is ""but our fantasy,"" but Marcellus has entreated him to watch with them. The Ghost appears, resembling the recently deceased King Hamlet, clad in the same armor he wore when he combated Norway. Horatio, struck with fear and wonder, attempts to speak to the Ghost, charging it to reveal its purpose, but it silently stalks away. Horatio, now convinced, remarks on its striking resemblance to the late king and believes its appearance ""bodes some strange eruption to our state,"" recalling similar ominous signs before Julius Caesar's fall in Rome. The Ghost reappears. Horatio again implores it to speak, asking if it has a message, a good deed to be done for its ease, knowledge of the country's fate, or hidden treasure. Before it can speak, the cock crows, startling the Ghost, and it vanishes. Horatio explains that spirits retreat at the cock's crow. He then suggests they inform young Hamlet, the dead King's son, believing the spirit, though dumb to them, will speak to him. They agree to share what they have witnessed with Hamlet.

**Scene II: A Room of State in the Palace.**
The current King, Claudius, addresses his court. He acknowledges his dear brother King Hamlet's death but declares that, with the court's approval, he has married his ""sometime sister, now our queen,"" Gertrude. Laertes, son of Polonius, requests permission to return to France, having come to Denmark for Claudius's coronation. Polonius confirms he has reluctantly granted his son leave, and the King also gives his blessing. The King then addresses Hamlet, noting his continued melancholic demeanor. Hamlet, in an aside, expresses his displeasure with the new King. The Queen urges Hamlet to cast off his dark mourning and accept the commonality of death. Hamlet asserts his grief is genuine, beyond mere outward show. The King admonishes Hamlet for his ""unmanly grief"" and ""impious stubbornness,"" reminding him he is ""most immediate to our throne"" and his ""son."" The Queen asks Hamlet to stay in Denmark and not return to Wittenberg. Hamlet agrees to obey his mother. Pleased, the King declares a celebration with cannon fire.

Once the court exits, Hamlet expresses profound despair and suicidal thoughts, wishing his ""solid flesh would melt."" He laments his mother's hasty marriage to his uncle, Claudius, less than two months after his father's death. He contrasts his noble father (""Hyperion"") with Claudius (""a satyr"") and expresses disgust at his mother's swift transition from deep mourning to remarriage, calling her ""Frailty."" He forces himself to remain silent about his inner turmoil.

Horatio, Bernardo, and Marcellus enter. Hamlet, initially joyful to see Horatio, questions why he has returned from Wittenberg, cynically suggesting it was for his mother's wedding rather than his father's funeral, noting how ""the funeral bak'd meats Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables."" Horatio then reveals the purpose of their visit: they saw his father's ghost. Hamlet interrogates them intensely about the Ghost's appearance, its armor, pale face, and grizzled beard. Convinced by their consistent account, Hamlet resolves to join their watch tonight, determined to speak to the apparition. He extracts a solemn promise from them not to reveal what they have seen. Alone again, Hamlet suspects ""foul play"" and eagerly awaits the night.

**Scene III: A Room in Polonius's House.**
Laertes is preparing to depart for France. He warns his sister, Ophelia, against Hamlet's affections, dismissing them as a fleeting ""toy in blood"" and not genuine or lasting. He emphasizes that Hamlet, as a prince, cannot choose his own path, as his choice impacts the entire state. Laertes cautions Ophelia to guard her honor. Ophelia promises to heed his advice but playfully warns him not to be a hypocrite, preaching a moral path while indulging in ""the primrose path of dalliance"" himself.

Polonius enters, hurrying Laertes to his ship. He then offers his son a lengthy list of precepts for conduct, including: ""Give thy thoughts no tongue,"" ""Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar,"" ""Grapple them to thy soul with hooks of steel"" for true friends, avoid quarrels, listen more than you speak, dress well but not ostentatiously, and ""Neither a borrower nor a lender be."" Most importantly, he advises, ""To thine ownself be true; And it must follow, as the night the day, Thou canst not then be false to any man."" Laertes departs.

Polonius then questions Ophelia about what Laertes told her. Ophelia reveals it was about Lord Hamlet. Polonius, concerned, states he has heard Hamlet has been spending private time with her and she has been receptive. He chastises her for her naiveté, calling her a ""green girl, Unsifted in such perilous circumstance,"" and questions if she believes Hamlet's declarations of affection. Ophelia admits she doesn't know what to think. Polonius dismisses Hamlet's ""honourable fashion"" and ""holy vows"" as ""springes to catch woodcocks"" (traps for the gullible) and strictly forbids Ophelia from having any further contact or conversation with Hamlet. Ophelia promises to obey.

**Scene IV: The Platform. Night.**
Hamlet, Horatio, and Marcellus are on watch. The cold air bites ""shrewdly."" They hear trumpets and cannon fire, signifying the King's late-night revelry. Hamlet criticizes this custom, calling it ""More honour'd in the breach than the observance."" The Ghost appears. Hamlet addresses it directly, calling it ""Hamlet, King, father: Royal Dane,"" and demands to know why his spirit is unrestrained, revisiting the earth in complete steel. The Ghost beckons Hamlet to follow it alone. Horatio and Marcellus try to restrain Hamlet, fearing it will lead him to madness or harm. Hamlet, disregarding their warnings and threats, breaks free and follows the Ghost, declaring he does not value his life or fear for his immortal soul.

**Scene V: A More Remote Part of the Platform. Night.**
The Ghost leads Hamlet to a secluded area. Hamlet demands it speak. The Ghost reveals itself to be the spirit of Hamlet's father, doomed to walk the night and ""fast in fires"" during the day until his earthly ""foul crimes"" are purged. It charges Hamlet to ""Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder."" Hamlet is shocked to hear of murder. The Ghost explains that the official story – that a serpent stung him while he slept in his orchard – is a lie. He reveals that ""The serpent that did sting thy father's life Now wears his crown,"" explicitly naming Claudius as the murderer. The Ghost details how Claudius, ""that incestuous, that adulterate beast,"" seduced Queen Gertrude with ""witchcraft of his wit"" and ""traitorous gifts."" He describes how Claudius poured ""juice of cursed hebenon"" into his ears while he slept, causing a swift, agonizing death that ravaged his body with a ""leperous distilment."" Thus, King Hamlet was ""Of life, of crown, of queen, at once despatch'd,"" dying without confession or last rites, with ""all my imperfections on my head."" The Ghost commands Hamlet to take revenge but warns him not to ""taint thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive Against thy mother aught: leave her to Heaven,"" and to ""those thorns that in her bosom lodge, To prick and sting her."" The Ghost then bids farewell, urging Hamlet to ""remember me,"" and vanishes as dawn approaches.

Hamlet, overwhelmed, vows to erase all other memories and live only for the Ghost's command of revenge. Horatio and Marcellus arrive, searching for Hamlet. Hamlet, agitated, makes cryptic and wild statements, leading them to believe he is disoriented. He extracts a solemn oath from them on his sword, reinforced by the Ghost's voice from beneath the stage, never to reveal what they have seen. Hamlet further warns them that he may ""put an antick disposition on"" (feign madness) in the future, and they must not give any sign of knowing his secret. He laments, ""The time is out of joint;--O cursèd spite, That ever I was born to set it right!"" They exit together.

**Act II**

**Scene I: A Room in Polonius's House.**
Ophelia, deeply distressed, tells her father Polonius about a terrifying encounter with Hamlet. She describes Hamlet entering her room with his clothes disheveled, pale, knees knocking, and a piteous look. He seized her by the wrist, stared intently at her face for a long time, then shook her arm, waved his head three times, sighed profoundly, and left without looking at her, keeping his eyes fixed on her until he was out of sight. Polonius, without hesitation, concludes that Hamlet is ""Mad for thy love."" Ophelia confirms that, following Polonius's command, she had ""repel[led] his letters, and denied His access to me."" Polonius now believes his instruction caused Hamlet's madness and determines to inform the King.

**Scene II: A Room in the Castle.**
King Claudius and Queen Gertrude welcome Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, Hamlet's childhood friends, to the court. They express concern over Hamlet's ""transformation"" and ""lunacy"" since his father's death, and ask the friends to spend time with him, ""draw him on to pleasures,"" and discover the cause of his affliction. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern readily agree. Polonius enters, announcing he has discovered ""The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy."" In a long-winded speech, he declares Hamlet is mad. He then presents a love letter from Hamlet to Ophelia, expressing his love, despite poor poetic skill. Polonius explains that upon observing Hamlet's ""hot love"" for Ophelia, he strictly commanded his daughter to reject Hamlet's advances and deny him access. He attributes Hamlet's subsequent sadness, weakness, and eventual ""madness"" directly to this rejection. The King and Queen, though somewhat skeptical, agree to Polonius's plan to observe Hamlet's interaction with Ophelia, while they hide.

Hamlet enters, reading a book, and Polonius approaches him. Hamlet, feigning madness, calls Polonius a ""fishmonger"" and makes cryptic remarks about honesty and Ophelia, warning Polonius not to let her ""walk i'the sun."" Polonius, aside, notes, ""Though this be madness, yet there's method in it."" Hamlet continues his ""mad"" discourse, reading ""slanders"" from his book that describe old men unflatteringly, which Polonius recognizes as hitting too close to home. Hamlet dismisses Polonius curtly.

Rosencrantz and Guildenstern enter. Hamlet greets them warmly but quickly discerns that they were ""sent for"" by the King and Queen to spy on him. They confess this. Hamlet then articulates his profound melancholy: he has ""lost all my mirth,"" finding the world a ""steril promontory"" and man, despite his noble qualities, merely a ""quintessence of dust,"" delighting neither him nor women. Rosencrantz reveals that a company of players is coming to court, which Hamlet greets with enthusiasm. He learns they are ""the tragedians of the city"" and are traveling due to new competition and a decline in public favor, possibly linked to Claudius's new reign.

Polonius re-enters to announce the players. Hamlet continues to mock Polonius with nonsensical wordplay and quotes from the story of Jephthah, implying a connection to Polonius's daughter. The Players enter, and Hamlet warmly welcomes them. He asks the First Player to recite a passionate speech, specifically Æneas's account of Priam's slaughter from a play he admired. The First Player delivers the speech with such emotion that Polonius is moved to tears.

After the Players depart, Hamlet, alone, reflects on his own inaction. He is struck by the player's ability to conjure such profound emotion for a fictional character (Hecuba) while he, Hamlet, with a real, urgent motive for revenge, remains paralyzed and cannot act. He berates himself as a ""rogue and peasant slave,"" a ""dull and muddy-mettled rascal,"" and a coward. He devises a plan: he will have the players perform a play, ""something like the murder of my father,"" before his uncle. He will ""observe his looks; I'll tent him to the quick: if he do blench, I know my course."" He acknowledges the Ghost he saw might be the Devil, seeking to ""Abuses me to damn me,"" so he needs concrete proof. He concludes, ""The play's the thing Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king.""

**Act III**

**Scene I: A Room in the Castle.**
The King and Queen question Rosencrantz and Guildenstern about Hamlet's behavior. They report that Hamlet confesses to feeling distracted but will not reveal the cause, maintaining a ""crafty madness."" They mention his excitement about the players and his invitation for the King and Queen to attend a play that night. The King and Queen, pleased by this development, encourage the friends to further engage Hamlet. The King then asks the Queen to leave, as he and Polonius have arranged for Ophelia to ""affront"" (confront) Hamlet while they secretly observe, hoping to determine if his madness stems from love. The Queen expresses her hope that Ophelia's beauty will restore Hamlet to sanity. Polonius instructs Ophelia to read a book to ""colour Your loneliness"" and reflects, aside, on how people often disguise evil with a ""devotion's visage."" The King, also aside, expresses guilt, feeling ""how smart A lash that speech doth give my conscience!"" They hide as Hamlet enters.

Hamlet delivers his famous soliloquy, ""To be, or not to be,"" contemplating suicide as an escape from life's suffering, but deterred by the unknown terrors of the afterlife – ""The undiscovered country, from whose bourn No traveller returns."" He concludes that this fear of what comes after death ""does make cowards of us all,"" causing great enterprises to falter and ""lose the name of action.""

Ophelia re-enters. Hamlet greets her, asking her to remember his sins in her prayers. Ophelia attempts to return ""remembrances"" (gifts) he once gave her. Hamlet denies ever having given them and, in an increasingly harsh and erratic manner, questions her honesty and beauty. He claims he never loved her and tells her to ""Get thee to a nunnery,"" warning her against being a ""breeder of sinners."" He calls himself proud, revengeful, and ambitious, and condemns all men as ""arrant knaves."" He asks where her father is, and upon learning he is home, demands the doors be shut upon him so he can only ""play the fool"" in his own house. He continues his tirade, railing against marriage and women's vanity and deceit, declaring ""I'll no more of't; it hath made me mad,"" and that there will be no more marriages, ""all but one"" (implying the King) shall live, the rest remain unmarried. Hamlet exits, still commanding, ""To a nunnery, go.""

Ophelia, heartbroken, laments the ""noble mind... o'erthrown,"" mourning Hamlet's apparent descent into madness. The King and Polonius emerge from hiding. The King concludes Hamlet's distress is not caused by love but by some deeper, underlying melancholy, and proposes sending Hamlet to England to demand ""neglected tribute,"" hoping travel will cure him. Polonius, still convinced Hamlet's madness is rooted in rejected love, suggests one last attempt: the Queen should speak with Hamlet after the play, and he (Polonius) will again hide and eavesdrop. If this fails, then Hamlet can be sent to England. The King agrees, stating, ""Madness in great ones must not unwatch'd go.""

**Scene II: A Room in the Castle.**
Hamlet instructs a Player on proper acting technique, emphasizing naturalness, temperance, and holding ""the mirror up to nature,"" and criticizing overacting and improvised clowning. Horatio enters, and Hamlet praises him for his steady character. Hamlet confides in Horatio, revealing that a scene in the upcoming play mirrors the circumstances of his father's death. He asks Horatio to keenly observe the King's reaction during this scene, specifically when the murder is enacted, to confirm the Ghost's accusations.

The court enters for the play. Hamlet engages in banter with the King, Ophelia, and Polonius, making pointed remarks and bawdy jokes, further cultivating his ""antic disposition."" The play, titled ""The Mouse-trap"" by Hamlet, begins with a dumb show depicting a King and Queen, the King sleeping, a villain pouring poison in his ear, and the villain then wooing the Queen. The Prologue then enters, followed by the Player King and Queen. The Player Queen declares undying love and vows never to remarry should her husband die. Hamlet interjects, remarking on the Player Queen's excessive protestation and commenting to Ophelia that ""woman's love"" is brief. The Player King, feeling unwell, falls asleep. The Player Queen exits. Queen Gertrude comments, ""The lady doth protest too much, methinks."" Hamlet insists the Player Queen will keep her word. The King asks if there is ""no offence in't."" Hamlet assures him it's ""poison in jest"" and for those with ""free souls.""

Lucianus, the Player King's nephew, enters on stage. Hamlet, acting as a ""chorus,"" explains that Lucianus murders the King ""i' the garden for his estate,"" by pouring poison into his ear. As Lucianus performs this act, King Claudius abruptly rises, crying, ""Give me some light: away!"" The court erupts in confusion, and everyone exits hastily, leaving Hamlet and Horatio alone. Hamlet is ecstatic, declaring ""O, good Horatio, I'll take the ghost's word for a thousand pounds."" Horatio confirms he ""did very well note him.""

Rosencrantz and Guildenstern return, stating the King is ""marvellous distempered"" with anger. They inform Hamlet the Queen wishes to speak with him. Hamlet, still feigning madness, questions Guildenstern about his inability to play a recorder, then chastises both friends, accusing them of trying to ""play upon me"" as if he were an instrument easier to manipulate than a simple pipe. Polonius enters, also announcing the Queen's summons. Hamlet makes Polonius agree that a cloud looks first like a camel, then a weasel, then a whale, emphasizing his erratic state. Hamlet agrees to go to his mother. Left alone, Hamlet feels a surge of dark resolve, proclaiming, ""Now could I drink hot blood, And do such bitter business as the day Would quake to look on."" He reminds himself to be ""cruel, not unnatural"" to his mother, intending to ""speak daggers to her, but use none.""

**Scene III: The Queen's Chamber.**
Polonius instructs the Queen to be firm with Hamlet, telling him his ""pranks have been too broad"" and that she has protected him from the King's wrath. Polonius then hides behind an arras to listen. Hamlet enters. A heated exchange ensues between Hamlet and his mother. The Queen accuses Hamlet of offending his father (Claudius). Hamlet retorts that she has offended *his* father (King Hamlet). When she asks if he has forgotten her, he reminds her she is ""the queen, your husband's brother's wife; And--would it were not so!--you are my mother."" The Queen threatens to send others to speak with him. Hamlet forces her to sit, declaring he will show her ""the inmost part of you."" The Queen cries for help, fearing murder. Polonius, from behind the arras, also cries for help. Thinking it is the King, Hamlet shouts, ""How now! a rat?"" and stabs Polonius through the arras, killing him. Hamlet then reveals the body, calling Polonius a ""wretched, rash, intruding fool."" He confronts his mother, accusing her of a ""bloody deed!--almost as bad... As kill a king, and marry with his brother.""

Hamlet forces his mother to look at two portraits, one of his father and one of Claudius. He vividly contrasts his noble father with the ""mildew'd ear"" that is Claudius, condemning her choice to ""batten on this moor."" He berates her for her ""damnèd incest"" and ""luxury"" with Claudius, accusing her of having ""black and grainèd spots"" on her soul.

The Ghost of King Hamlet appears, visible only to Hamlet. Hamlet, seeing his father, asks if he has come to chide his ""tardy son"" for neglecting his command for revenge. The Ghost confirms he came ""to whet thy almost blunted purpose"" and to protect the Queen. The Queen, unable to see the Ghost, believes Hamlet is mad, speaking to ""incorporal air."" Hamlet desperately tries to make her see it, but she insists she sees nothing and hears only their voices. The Ghost exits. The Queen, convinced Hamlet is insane, attributes his vision to ""ecstasy."" Hamlet denies his madness, offering to re-word his statements. He urges his mother to confess her sins to Heaven, repent, and avoid Claudius's bed, to ""Assume a virtue, if you have it not."" The Queen expresses deep remorse. Hamlet tells her to live purer and bids her good night. He expresses regret for killing Polonius and states he will ""answer well The death I gave him."" He exits, dragging Polonius's body, proclaiming, ""I must be cruel, only to be kind: Thus bad begins, and worse remains behind.""

**Act IV**

**Scene I: A Room in the Castle.**
The King questions the Queen about Hamlet. She reports that Hamlet, ""Mad as the sea and wind,"" heard a noise behind the arras, cried ""A rat, a rat!"" and killed ""the unseen good old man,"" Polonius. The King expresses horror, realizing it could have been him. He immediately decides Hamlet must be sent to England and resolves to ""countenance and excuse"" the deed to the public, as Hamlet is loved by the ""distracted multitude."" He summons Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, orders them to find Hamlet, retrieve Polonius's body, and bring it to the chapel. Rosencrantz returns shortly, reporting they cannot get Hamlet to reveal the body's location, but Hamlet is now under guard. The King orders Hamlet brought before him.

Hamlet is brought in. The King demands to know where Polonius is. Hamlet mockingly replies that Polonius is ""At supper,"" not eating, but ""eaten"" by ""politick worms."" He tells the King to seek Polonius in Heaven, or if not there, to search ""i'the other place yourself,"" or in a month, he will ""nose him as you go up the stairs into the lobby."" The King then informs Hamlet that for his ""especial safety,"" he must go to England. Hamlet agrees readily, bidding farewell to his ""dear mother,"" and equating the King to his mother by saying ""Father and mother is man and wife; man and wife is one flesh; and so, my mother."" Hamlet exits for England.

The King, alone, reveals his secret plot: he has sent letters to England, ordering ""The present death of Hamlet."" He hopes this execution will cure his own anxieties.

**Scene II: A Room in the Castle.**
The Queen refuses to speak with Ophelia, but Horatio convinces her, explaining that Ophelia is distraught and ""may strew Dangerous conjectures in ill-breeding minds."" Ophelia enters, clearly mad, singing fragmented songs about a lost true love and death (""He is dead and gone""). She distributes imaginary flowers, assigning symbolic meanings: rosemary for remembrance, pansies for thoughts, fennel for flattery, columbines, rue for sorrow (with a pointed comment to the Queen about wearing her rue ""with a difference""), and a daisy, lamenting that violets withered when her father died. She sings about a maiden who was deflowered. The King enters and observes her, noting her ""conceit upon her father."" Ophelia exits, still singing and saying good night. The King orders Horatio to watch over her closely. The King laments that ""When sorrows come, they come not single spies, But in battalions!""

Marcellus enters, warning the King that Laertes is leading a riotous rebellion, with the common people proclaiming, ""Laertes shall be king!"" Laertes, armed and with followers, bursts in, demanding his father from the King. The Queen tries to interpose. Laertes fiercely declares his intent for revenge. The King, reassuring the Queen of his divine protection, asks Laertes the cause of his rebellion. Laertes demands to know how his father died. The King tells him Polonius is dead but insists he is innocent, promising to help Laertes find the true offender and exact revenge.

Ophelia re-enters, fantastically dressed with straws and flowers, singing about her father's burial. Laertes is devastated by his sister's madness, grieving for the loss of her wits. He observes her symbolic distribution of flowers. Ophelia exits, followed by the Queen. The King reiterates his innocence to Laertes and proposes they jointly seek justice. Laertes, still furious over his father's ""obscure funeral"" and lack of formal rites, vows to question his death. The King promises ""where the offence is let the great axe fall.""

Bernardo enters with letters from Hamlet, addressed to the King and Queen. The King reads his letter, in which Hamlet announces his unexpected return, ""set naked on your kingdom,"" and his intent to see the King tomorrow to explain his ""sudden and more strange return."" The King is baffled. Laertes recognizes Hamlet's handwriting and is inflamed with renewed desire for revenge. The King seizes this opportunity and proposes a cunning plan to Laertes:
They will arrange a fencing match between Hamlet and Laertes, leveraging Laertes' renowned skill, previously praised by a Norman gentleman. Hamlet, being ""remiss"" and unsuspicious, will not inspect the foils. Laertes can then choose ""A sword unbated"" (unblunted). Laertes eagerly adds to the plan, revealing he has a ""mortal"" poison from a mountebank, with which he will anoint his sword point, ensuring that even a slight scratch will be fatal to Hamlet. The King further elaborates: during the match, when Hamlet becomes hot and thirsty, he will offer him a poisoned ""chalice"" to drink from, ensuring Hamlet's death even if the poisoned blade fails.

The Queen enters, delivering tragic news: Ophelia has drowned. She describes Ophelia making garlands of flowers, climbing a willow tree, and falling into the brook when a branch broke. Laertes is overcome with grief, trying to suppress his tears but unable to control his ""womanish passion."" He exits, filled with a ""speech of fire."" The King follows, fearing for Laertes' rage now that his grief is compounded.

**Act V**

**Scene I: A Church Yard.**
Two gravediggers (Clowns) debate whether Ophelia, having ""wilfully seeks her own salvation"" (committed suicide), should be granted a Christian burial. They engage in a comically convoluted legal argument, filled with puns and misinterpretations of terms like ""_se offendendo_"" and ""_crowner's-quest law_."" The First Clown asserts that if Ophelia were not a gentlewoman, she would be buried outside of Christian ground, lamenting that ""great folks should have countenance in this world to drown or hang themselves, more than their even christian."" They riddle about who builds stronger than a mason, shipwright, or carpenter, with the answer being a grave-maker, whose ""houses... last till doomsday."" The Second Clown exits to fetch liquor.

Hamlet and Horatio enter, observing the First Clown singing cheerfully while digging up bones. Hamlet is struck by the gravedigger's insensitivity. The gravedigger throws up a skull, prompting Hamlet to muse on its former occupant, perhaps a politician or a lawyer, now reduced to dirt. Hamlet questions the gravedigger, who, playing on words, claims the grave is his because he is in it. The gravedigger reveals he has been a sexton for thirty years, since the day King Hamlet defeated Fortinbras, and since ""young Hamlet was born,"" the Hamlet who is now ""mad, and sent into England."" Hamlet inquires about how long a body lasts before rotting, and the gravedigger identifies a particular skull as Yorick's, the King's jester.

Hamlet takes Yorick's skull, recalling him fondly from his childhood, remembering Yorick's ""infinite jest"" and ""flashes of merriment."" He laments the inevitable decay of all life and greatness, musing how even Alexander the Great and Imperial Caesar are reduced to dust that might ""stop a bung-hole"" or ""patch a wall.""

A funeral procession enters with Ophelia's corpse, followed by Laertes, the King, Queen, and mourners. Hamlet and Horatio hide. Laertes asks the Priest what further ceremony will be performed. The Priest explains that because her death was ""doubtful"" (suspected suicide), her ""obsequies have been as far enlarg'd As we have warranty,"" meaning she receives curtailed rites, not a full Christian burial. He states they cannot sing a _requiem_ for her. Laertes, angered by the ""churlish priest,"" declares his sister will be a ""ministering angel"" while the priest howls in hell.

Hamlet, upon realizing it is Ophelia's burial, reveals himself, crying, ""What, the fair Ophelia!"" The Queen scatters flowers on the grave, lamenting that she hoped Ophelia would be Hamlet's wife, not buried. Laertes, consumed by grief, leaps into the grave, expressing his immense sorrow and wishing mountains piled upon them. Hamlet steps forward, demanding to know ""What is he whose grief Bears such an emphasis?"" He then announces, ""this is I, Hamlet the Dane."" Laertes leaps out of the grave and grapples with Hamlet, cursing him. The King and Queen order them separated. Hamlet proclaims his profound love for Ophelia, asserting, ""I lov'd Ophelia: forty thousand brothers Could not... Make up my sum."" He challenges Laertes to prove his grief through action. The Queen attributes Hamlet's outburst to madness. Hamlet exits, stating, ""Let Hercules himself do what he may, The cat will mew, and dog will have his day."" The King sends Horatio to follow Hamlet and reassures Laertes that they will address the matter with a ""living monument"" for Ophelia and bring their plan against Hamlet to fruition.

**Scene II: Hall in the Castle.**
Hamlet apologizes to Horatio for his behavior towards Laertes at the grave, recognizing Laertes' grief mirrors his own. Osric, a foppish courtier, enters. Hamlet, continuing his ""antic disposition,"" engages Osric in a witty, confusing exchange about the weather. Osric delivers a message from the King: the King has wagered six Barbary horses against six French rapiers and daggers that Hamlet will not exceed Laertes by three hits in a fencing match of twelve passes. The King desires an immediate trial. Hamlet accepts, saying he will try to win for the King, but if not, he will only incur ""shame and the odd hits."" Osric departs.

Horatio expresses foreboding, fearing Hamlet will lose. Hamlet admits to a ""gain-giving"" (misgiving) in his heart but dismisses it as ""foolery,"" defying augury and trusting in ""a special providence in the fall of a sparrow.""

The King, Queen, Laertes, Lords, Ladies, and Attendants enter for the fencing match. The King asks Hamlet to take Laertes' hand. Hamlet sincerely apologizes to Laertes for his ""madness,"" saying he ""shot my arrow o'er the house, And hurt my brother."" Laertes accepts the apology ""in nature,"" but states he will still proceed with the match for his honor, accepting Hamlet's ""offer'd love like love."" Foils are presented. Hamlet chooses one, and Laertes finds one too heavy and asks for another. The King reminds Hamlet of the wager.

The King announces that if Hamlet scores the first or second hit, or is even after the third exchange, cannons will fire, and he will drink to Hamlet's health, dropping a ""union"" (a poisoned pearl) into the cup. He then drinks (or pretends to) and offers the cup to Hamlet. Hamlet defers, saying he will play the first bout, and sets the cup aside.

They begin to fence. Hamlet scores the first hit. Osric confirms, ""A hit, a very palpable hit."" They continue. Hamlet scores a second hit. Laertes admits, ""A touch, a touch, I do confess."" The Queen, celebrating Hamlet's success, takes the poisoned cup and drinks to Hamlet's fortune, despite the King's urgent warning, ""Gertrude, do not drink."" The King, aside, realizes, ""It is the poison'd cup; it is too late.""

Laertes, seeing Hamlet winning, decides he must act. He wounds Hamlet with his unbated, poisoned rapier. In the ensuing scuffle, they exchange rapiers, and Hamlet wounds Laertes with the now-poisoned blade. The Queen falls back in her chair, declaring, ""No, no, the drink, the drink,--O, my dear Hamlet,--The drink, the drink! I am poison'd."" She is carried away, dying.

Laertes, mortally wounded, reveals to Hamlet, ""It is here, Hamlet: Hamlet, thou art slain; No medicine in the world can do thee good, In thee there is not half an hour's life; The treacherous instrument is in thy hand, Unbated and envenom'd."" He confesses that ""the foul practice Hath turn'd itself on me"" and that ""Thy mother's poison'd: I can no more: the king, the king's to blame.""

Hamlet, realizing the full treachery, cries, ""The point Envenom'd too! Then, venom, to thy work."" He stabs King Claudius, calling him ""incestuous, murd'rous, damnèd Dane,"" and forces him to drink from the poisoned cup. The King is mortally wounded and carried away. Laertes, before dying, exchanges forgiveness with Hamlet, stating, ""Mine and my father's death come not upon thee, Nor thine on me!"" He dies.

Hamlet, feeling death's approach, says, ""Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee."" He implores Horatio to live and ""Report me and my cause aright To the unsatisfied,"" as his ""wounded name"" will suffer if his story is untold. Horatio, in despair, tries to drink the remaining poison, declaring, ""I am more an antique Roman than a Dane"" (referring to suicide). Hamlet wrestles the cup from him, insisting Horatio must live to tell his story. With his final words, Hamlet states, ""The potent poison quite o'er-crows my spirit; The rest is silence."" He dies. The play concludes with a Dead March."
Jane Eyre-Charlotte Brontë,"The plot of ""Jane Eyre"" unfolds as follows:

**Childhood at Gateshead Hall:**
The story begins with Jane, an orphan living at Gateshead Hall, where she is mistreated by her aunt, Mrs. Reed, and her cousins, Eliza, John, and Georgiana Reed. Mrs. Reed excludes Jane from the family, claiming she lacks a ""sociable and childlike disposition."" John, the eldest cousin, frequently bullies Jane. During one such incident, he throws a book at her, causing her head to bleed. Jane, enraged, calls him a ""wicked and cruel boy."" Mrs. Reed, alerted by Bessie (the nurse) and Abbot (the lady's-maid), blames Jane and orders her locked in the ""red-room,"" the room where Mr. Reed (Jane's deceased uncle and Mrs. Reed's husband) died.

In the red-room, Jane experiences intense fear, believing the room is haunted by her uncle's spirit. She recalls that Mr. Reed had made his wife promise to raise Jane as her own child before he died. Overwhelmed by terror after seeing a gleam of light, Jane screams and shakes the door. Mrs. Reed and the servants return, and Mrs. Reed, despite Jane's pleas, extends her punishment, then forcibly locks her back in, causing Jane to lose consciousness.

**Lowood Institution:**
Jane awakens in her bed with Mr. Lloyd, an apothecary, and Bessie present. Mr. Lloyd questions her about her health. Later, Jane overhears Bessie and another servant, Sarah, discussing ghost stories and Mrs. Reed's harshness. The next day, Jane remains miserable despite Bessie's unexpected kindness. Mr. Lloyd returns and, after Jane reveals her unhappiness at Gateshead due to her treatment and lack of family, suggests she go to school. Jane, desiring a complete change and escape, expresses a strong wish to attend school. She overhears that Mrs. Reed is eager to be rid of her. Jane also learns details of her parents' death from typhus fever and her mother's disinheritance by her own father (Mr. Reed's father-in-law) for marrying a poor clergyman.

Mr. Brocklehurst, the manager of Lowood Institution, visits Gateshead. Mrs. Reed tells him Jane is deceitful and asks him to keep a strict eye on her at Lowood, ensuring she is kept humble. Mr. Brocklehurst, who strictly adheres to principles of plainness and denial, agrees. After he leaves, Jane confronts Mrs. Reed, declaring her hatred for her and accusing her of deceit and cruelty. Mrs. Reed, momentarily flustered, retreats. Jane feels a fleeting triumph followed by remorse.

Jane leaves Gateshead for Lowood. Upon arrival, she is met by Miss Temple, the kind superintendent, and Miss Miller, an under-teacher. She observes the strict, austere conditions of the charity-school: insufficient clothing, meagre and often inedible food (burnt porridge), and cold dormitories where washing water freezes. She meets Helen Burns, a fellow pupil, who teaches her about endurance and Christian forgiveness, contrasting with Jane's more rebellious nature. Jane witnesses Helen being frequently and cruelly punished by Miss Scatcherd, a teacher, for perceived faults like untidiness, yet Helen bears it patiently.

Mr. Brocklehurst visits Lowood and expresses his extreme disapproval of any indulgence, including clean tuckers and the supplementary bread and cheese Miss Temple provided. He orders all the girls' hair to be cut short, believing natural curls are a sign of vanity. During this visit, Jane accidentally drops her slate, drawing Mr. Brocklehurst's attention. He makes her stand on a stool and publicly denounces her as a liar, citing Mrs. Reed's accusations, and warns the other girls to shun her. Miss Temple, however, quietly reassures Jane. After school, Jane is in despair, but Helen comforts her, asserting that self-approval is paramount. Miss Temple then summons Jane and Helen, allows Jane to tell her side of the story, and promises to write to Mr. Lloyd for corroboration. She also provides them with a generous tea, noting Helen's poor health. A week later, Mr. Lloyd's letter clears Jane's name, and Miss Temple publicly announces it. Jane thrives at Lowood, becoming a diligent student and later a teacher.

However, typhus fever breaks out at Lowood, turning the school into a hospital. Many girls die, including Helen Burns, who succumbs to consumption. Jane spends Helen's last night with her in Miss Temple's room, and Helen dies peacefully in her arms. The epidemic leads to a public inquiry, which exposes the school's unhealthy conditions and Mr. Brocklehurst's neglect. New regulations and improvements are implemented, making Lowood a better institution.

**Thornfield Hall:**
After eight years at Lowood (six as a pupil, two as a teacher), Miss Temple marries and leaves. Jane feels a profound loss and a renewed longing for change and a wider world. She places an advertisement for a governess position. She receives a reply from a Mrs. Fairfax of Thornfield, offering £30 per annum.

Jane travels to Thornfield, a large, old manor house. She meets Mrs. Fairfax, the kind housekeeper, who she initially mistakes for the mistress. She also meets her pupil, Adèle Varens, a young French girl. Jane learns that the house belongs to Mr. Rochester, Adèle's guardian, who travels frequently. Jane often hears a strange, mirthless laugh and murmurs from the third storey, which Mrs. Fairfax attributes to Grace Poole, a servant. Jane also overhears comments suggesting a mystery surrounds Grace Poole and her high wages.

One evening, while walking to post a letter, Jane encounters a horseman who has fallen on ice. She assists him, and he, in turn, helps himself to his horse. She realizes this stern, dark-featured man is Mr. Rochester, the master of Thornfield. He is intrigued by her.

Mr. Rochester returns to Thornfield and invites Jane and Adèle to tea. He is abrupt and challenging but also shows a keen interest in Jane's mind, art (she shows him her imaginative drawings), and honest opinions. He reveals Adèle is the daughter of a French opera-dancer, Céline Varens, with whom he had a past affair, and whom he discovered to be unfaithful and mercenary. He hints at past sorrows and a desire for ""re-transformation."" Jane, despite her initial resolve to maintain distance, finds herself drawn to him.

One night, Jane is awakened by a ""demoniac laugh"" and screams, then a struggle from the third storey. She discovers Mr. Rochester's bed curtains on fire and puts out the flames. He insists it was Grace Poole's nightmare and tells Jane to keep silent about the true events. Later, he confesses to Jane that the ""lunatic"" woman is confined in the third storey, and that Grace Poole is her keeper. Jane suspects Grace Poole is somehow involved in the incident, but Mr. Rochester dismisses her concerns. He expresses deep gratitude to Jane for saving his life and hints at a profound connection between them.

Mr. Rochester leaves for a party at the Leas, where he is expected to court Miss Blanche Ingram, a beautiful, accomplished, but haughty woman. Mrs. Fairfax believes he intends to marry Miss Ingram. Jane, observing Mr. Rochester's attentions to Miss Ingram, experiences a ""poignant pleasure"" mixed with despair. She believes he is marrying for social reasons rather than love, as Blanche seems superficial and treats Adèle unkindly. Jane, to remind herself of her own plainness and low status, draws contrasting portraits of herself and an imaginary Blanche Ingram.

During the party, a ""gipsy"" fortune-teller arrives. Blanche Ingram and other ladies consult her, returning vexed and surprised, claiming the gipsy knew their secrets. Jane is then summoned. In the library, the gipsy, who is Mr. Rochester in disguise, questions Jane about her past and feelings, revealing his knowledge of her habits and suspicions about her love for him. He confesses he feigned courtship of Miss Ingram to make Jane jealous and to test her feelings. Jane, shocked and indignant, admits her feelings for him. At this point, Mr. Mason, Bertha's brother, unexpectedly arrives. Mr. Rochester reacts with extreme distress. He sends Jane for wine and tells her to bring Mason to the library, then locks her in with the wounded Mason, instructing her not to speak to him. Jane then discovers Mason has been stabbed and bitten. Mr. Rochester returns with a surgeon, Mr. Carter, and reveals that Bertha, his mad wife, attacked Mason. He administers a ""cordial"" to Mason and arranges for his discreet departure.

**The Proposal and Revelation:**
After Mason leaves, Mr. Rochester takes Jane to the orchard. He speaks of his miserable past, his forced marriage to Bertha Mason (a Creole from Jamaica, from a family with a history of madness), and his despair. He describes Bertha's violent and depraved nature, which his father and brother concealed from him for her fortune. He confesses his plan to take a new wife (Jane) despite being legally married, believing he is justified due to Bertha's madness and his own suffering. He proposes marriage to Jane, who, despite her profound love, initially struggles with the moral implications of becoming his mistress.

Jane, tormented, declares she cannot marry him while he is already married. She asserts her independence and moral principles, even though it breaks her heart to leave him. He attempts to coerce her, physically and emotionally, but she remains firm, stating she must abide by God's law. In a moment of intense emotional conflict, as Jane is about to yield, she hears a mysterious voice call ""Jane! Jane! Jane!"" which she recognizes as Mr. Rochester's, though it seems to come from nowhere. Taking this as a divine sign to flee temptation, she resolves to leave.

She departs Thornfield Hall before dawn, leaving her few possessions and money. She travels for two days, eventually ending up destitute at Whitcross, a remote moorland crossroads. She sleeps on the moors, suffering from hunger and cold.

**Moor House:**
Near death from exposure and starvation, Jane sees a light in the distance and makes her way to a small house, Moor House. She begs for shelter and food, but the old housekeeper, Hannah, is suspicious and initially turns her away. However, St. John Rivers, the young clergyman of the house, discovers her and takes her in. She meets his sisters, Diana and Mary, who are kind and compassionate. Jane, wishing to avoid discovery, gives the false name ""Jane Elliott.""

Jane recovers at Moor House and bonds with Diana and Mary, who are educated and intellectual. St. John, however, is more reserved and ambitious. She learns that the Rivers siblings are also Jane's cousins: their mother was her father's sister. St. John reveals that their uncle, Mr. John Eyre, of Madeira, has died and left his entire fortune of twenty thousand pounds to his other niece, his clergyman brother's orphan daughter—Jane Eyre. Jane, overjoyed by finding family, reveals her true identity and insists on dividing the inheritance equally among the four cousins, despite St. John's initial objections.

Jane accepts a position as schoolmistress for a new village girls' school in Morton, established by St. John, with a small cottage to live in. She works diligently and gains the affection of her pupils. St. John, observing her character, tries to persuade her to become his wife and accompany him to India as a missionary, believing she is suited for the work, but not for love. Jane refuses to marry him, stating she would be a ""useful tool"" but not a loved wife, and feels it would be a ""monstrous martyrdom"" to marry without love. She offers to go as his sister and fellow-missionary, but he insists on marriage as the only acceptable arrangement.

St. John persists in his efforts to persuade her, invoking God's will and warning her of spiritual perdition if she refuses. Jane is almost swayed, but at the crucial moment, she again hears Mr. Rochester's voice calling ""Jane! Jane! Jane!"" in her mind, seemingly from a great distance. This experience confirms her resolve. She tells St. John she must discover what has become of Mr. Rochester.

**Reunion and Conclusion:**
Jane travels back to Thornfield, which she finds in ruins, having been burnt down. At a local inn, she learns from the former butler the full story: Bertha Mason, Mr. Rochester's mad wife, set the fire. Mr. Rochester, while saving the servants, returned to rescue Bertha, but she jumped from the roof and died. In the collapse of the burning house, Mr. Rochester lost an eye and a hand, and the sight of his other eye. He is now blind and crippled, living in seclusion at Ferndean, a remote manor house, attended only by old John and Mary.

Jane immediately goes to Ferndean. She finds Mr. Rochester, changed but still recognizable, blind and despairing. He does not recognize her voice at first, but when she touches him, he realizes it is she. He is overwhelmed with joy and disbelief, thinking she is a vision. Jane reveals her true identity and that she is now wealthy, having inherited five thousand pounds from her uncle John Eyre. She pledges to stay with him, to be his companion, his eyes, and his hands.

Mr. Rochester, initially hesitant and self-pitying due to his injuries, gradually accepts her love and devotion. He confesses his remorse for his past actions and his belief that his suffering was a divine chastisement that humbled him and led to their reunion. He recounts how he cried out for her in his despair, and heard her voice reply, confirming their spiritual connection.

Jane and Mr. Rochester have a quiet wedding. They live happily at Ferndean. Mr. Rochester eventually recovers partial sight in one eye, allowing him to dimly see their first-born son, who inherits his former brilliant eyes. Diana and Mary Rivers marry and visit them regularly. St. John Rivers goes to India as a missionary, remains unmarried, and dedicates his life to God's work, anticipating his own early death and heavenly reward. Jane and Mr. Rochester enjoy ten years of profound love, companionship, and equality, with Jane serving as his vision and support, finding her ultimate happiness with him."
Madame Bovary-Gustave Flaubert,"Here is a detailed plot summary of the provided text, focusing solely on the events and characters within it:

**Part I**

**Chapter One**
The story begins with the arrival of a new student, a country lad named Charles Bovary, in a school class. He is fifteen, taller than his classmates, and wears an unusual, composite cap that elicits laughter. The head-master introduces him to the class-master, Monsieur Roger, who places him in the second class. Charles is initially shy and awkward, struggling to articulate his name, which sounds like ""Charbovari,"" leading to further ridicule from his peers and the master. Despite the teasing, Charles is a conscientious student.

His family background is then revealed. His father, Monsieur Charles Denis Bartolome Bovary, was a retired assistant-surgeon-major who lost his military position due to ""conscription scandals."" He married a hosier's daughter for her sixty-thousand-franc dowry, which he subsequently squandered through lavish living. His parents had a strained marriage; his father was dissolute and unfaithful, while his mother became bitter, managing their dwindling affairs with silent stoicism. Charles was spoiled by his mother but his father tried to raise him hardily. He received a rudimentary education from the village curate. At twelve, he was sent to school at Rouen. He was an average student, securing one certificate in natural history. After three years, his parents withdrew him to study medicine. He lived in Rouen, but neglected his studies for public-houses, dominoes, and women, failing his first medical examination. His mother concealed this from his father, and Charles eventually passed five years later by rote learning.

He decided to practice medicine in Tostes, where a doctor had recently died. Charles's mother found him a wife: Madame Dubuc, a forty-five-year-old widow of a bailiff, with an income of twelve hundred francs. Despite her unattractiveness, she had many suitors, but Charles's mother skillfully secured the marriage. Charles had hoped for a freer life, but his wife was domineering. She controlled his finances, dictated his social conduct, harassed his patients for payment, and monitored his correspondence and movements. She was hypochondriacal, constantly complaining and demanding his attention, accusing him of neglecting her and loving another, before asking for medicine and more love.

**Chapter Two**
One night, Charles and his wife were awakened by a request for Charles to attend to a broken leg at the Bertaux farm, eighteen miles away. Due to the dark night, his wife insisted he wait for the moonrise and send a stable-boy ahead. At 4 AM, Charles departed, dozing on his horse until he was met by a boy who led him to the prosperous farm of Monsieur Rouault. Monsieur Rouault, a fifty-year-old widower, had broken his leg. His daughter, Emma, managed the household.

Emma, a young woman in a blue merino dress, received Charles. Charles found Monsieur Rouault in bed. The fracture was simple, and Charles competently set the leg. Emma assisted, pricking her fingers while sewing pads for the bandages. Charles noticed her delicate, almond-shaped nails and dark, candid eyes, noting her grace despite her hands not being ""beautiful."" Monsieur Rouault invited Charles to eat. During the meal, Emma expressed her disdain for country life and her longing for town experiences. Charles was struck by her appearance and elegance. As Charles was leaving, Emma helped him find his whip, and their bodies brushed, causing her to blush.

Instead of returning in three days as promised, Charles returned the next day, and then regularly twice a week, ostensibly to check on the patient. Monsieur Rouault recovered well, enhancing Charles's reputation in the area. Charles found his visits to the Bertaux a delightful exception to his monotonous life, taking extra care with his appearance. Emma always accompanied him to the first step of the stairs when he left.

Charles's wife, Madame Bovary junior (Heloise), became intensely jealous upon learning of Emma's existence and ""good education."" She accused Charles of preferring ""town misses."" Charles, weary of her accusations, stopped visiting the Bertaux after Heloise made him swear on a prayer-book. He began to find Heloise unattractive and their domestic life unbearable.

Charles's mother visited, leading to arguments with Heloise about Charles's habits. It was then revealed that Heloise's considerable dowry was largely gone, lost to a notary who had absconded and to mortgages. Charles's father, enraged by this deception, blamed his wife for the unfortunate marriage. Further arguments ensued, and Charles's parents left. A week later, Heloise suffered a hemorrhage and died. Charles was deeply surprised and saddened, reflecting on her love for him.

**Chapter Three**
Old Rouault brought Charles seventy-five francs and a turkey for his medical services, offering condolences for his loss and encouraging him to visit the Bertaux for solace. Charles followed this advice and returned to the farm, finding it lively and unchanged since his last visit five months prior. Rouault, now recovered, treated Charles with great attention due to his widowhood. Charles found himself laughing, then was momentarily depressed by the memory of his deceased wife, but soon forgot her over coffee.

Charles grew accustomed to living alone, finding new delight in his independence. His practice increased due to local sympathy. He was now free to visit the Bertaux as he wished, feeling vaguely happy and even more handsome. One afternoon, he found Emma alone in the dim kitchen, sewing. She offered him a glass of liqueur, and they shared a drink, Emma provocatively licking the bottom of her glass. They conversed, Emma speaking of her convent education and her dislike for country life, revealing her dreams of urbanity.

Returning home, Charles was consumed by thoughts of Emma, wondering if she would marry and to whom. He was sleepless, imagining her. He resolved to propose marriage, but his shyness prevented him from speaking. Old Rouault, eager to marry off Emma and in financial difficulty, observed Charles's blushes and decided he would accept the proposal.

At Michaelmas, Charles spent three days at the Bertaux. On his departure, he finally stammered out a proposal to Rouault, who, after consulting Emma, signaled her acceptance by opening a window shutter. The next day, Emma, blushing, accepted Charles. They agreed to marry in the spring, after Charles's mourning period. Emma began preparing her trousseau, dreaming of a romantic, midnight wedding, but settled for a large, traditional country wedding with forty-three guests, lasting sixteen hours and continuing for days.

**Chapter Four**
The wedding guests arrived from various villages in diverse conveyances. Both families' relatives and friends attended, dressed in their finest, despite the country setting. The gentlemen helped unharness the horses. The wedding procession walked to the mairie and then the church. Emma's long dress trailed, and Charles waited for her. Charles's father, despite despising the country folk, flirted with a young peasant, while Charles's mother walked with old Rouault. The guests talked business or made jokes. The fiddler played continuously.

The wedding feast was held under a cart-shed, featuring an abundance of rich dishes, including sirloins, fricassees, roast suckling pig, and elaborate desserts, notably a confectioner's work representing a temple and castle. Eating continued late into the night, interspersed with games and drunken revelry. Some guests snored at the table. Horses, overfed, became difficult to manage when guests departed, leading to runaway carts. Those who stayed continued drinking. A cousin attempted a prank on Emma, but Rouault stopped him, citing Charles's social standing. Charles's mother, feeling excluded, retired early, while his father drank kirsch-punch all night. Charles, not being witty, did not shine at the wedding reception.

The next day, Charles was transformed, openly affectionate with Emma, calling her ""my wife."" Two days after the wedding, Charles and Emma left for Tostes. Old Rouault accompanied them part of the way, feeling a deep sadness as he watched their carriage disappear, recalling his own wedding and lost happiness. Charles and Emma arrived at Tostes to be greeted by their old servant, Nastasie, who apologized for the unprepared dinner and invited Emma to inspect their new home.

**Chapter Five**
The Bovarys' house in Tostes is described as a modest, brick-fronted dwelling. It contained a combined dining and sitting room, a small consulting room for Charles filled with medical books, and a dilapidated back room for storage. The garden featured a sundial and a plaster statue of a curate reading his breviary. Upstairs, their bedroom contained a mahogany bed and a shell box. Emma noticed a bride's bouquet on the secretary, which had belonged to Charles's deceased first wife. Charles, observing her gaze, moved the bouquet to the attic. Emma, reflecting on her own bridal flowers, wondered what would become of them if she were to die.

Emma began to make changes to the house, redecorating and arranging the garden, even considering a fountain. Charles, happy and carefree, bought a second-hand dogcart for her. He found endless joy in their domestic life and adored Emma, reproaching himself for not loving her more, even finding beauty in her morning appearance. He was constantly affectionate towards her.

Emma, however, felt a profound disappointment. She had believed herself in love before marriage, but the expected ""felicity, passion, rapture"" from books had not materialized. She couldn't articulate her vague unhappiness.

**Chapter Six**
Emma's early life is narrated. At thirteen, she was sent to a convent, where she initially enjoyed the religious atmosphere, romanticizing it and inventing sins for confession. She read romantic and historical novels, dreaming of elegant manor-houses, heroic figures, and exotic landscapes, contrasting them with her familiarity with rustic life. When her mother died, she mourned dramatically, seeing herself as a figure of ""pale lives."" The nuns noticed her growing detachment from religious vocation. Upon leaving the convent, she initially enjoyed managing her father's household, but soon grew bored and missed the convent. When Charles first came to the Bertaux, she felt ""disillusioned,"" believing she had nothing left to learn or feel. However, Charles's presence and the novelty of her new situation made her believe she was finally experiencing the ""wondrous passion"" she had read about. She now felt that the quiet calm of her life was not the happiness she had truly desired.

**Chapter Seven**
Emma sometimes viewed her honeymoon as the happiest time, yet longed for exotic lands, luxury, and a husband who understood ""all mysteries."" Charles's conversation was ordinary, and he lacked the worldly accomplishments she admired. He believed her to be happy, which irritated her. Emma's artistic pursuits, like drawing and playing the piano, were admired by Charles, but she felt unfulfilled. She managed their household well, which contributed to Charles's rising self-esteem.

Charles's mother frequently visited, criticizing Emma's extravagant tastes and lack of domestic economy. She saw Charles's love for Emma as a desertion of her own maternal affection. Charles was caught between the two women, unable to resolve their conflicts. Emma, attempting to generate love for Charles, recited passionate verses and melancholic songs, but remained unmoved, and Charles equally so. She concluded that Charles's passion was merely a habit.

She received an Italian greyhound and often walked alone to a deserted pavilion, contemplating her unhappiness. She yearned for a different life, imagining a handsome, witty, distinguished husband and the vibrant city life her former convent companions might have. Her life felt ""cold"" and filled with ""ennui."" She recalled her past school triumphs, now distant.

In late September, the Marquis d'Andervilliers, whom Charles had cured, invited them to a ball at his château, Vaubyessard. The Marquis, impressed by Emma's appearance, extended the invitation. Charles and Emma set out for Vaubyessard in their dogcart.

**Chapter Eight**
They arrived at the grand, modern château of Vaubyessard at nightfall, welcomed by servants and the Marquis. Emma was impressed by the opulent marble vestibule, the gallery with ancestral portraits, and the billiard room. She met the Marchioness.

At dinner, Emma observed the refined atmosphere and the elegant guests. She noticed the old Duke de Laverdiere, the Marquis's father-in-law, eating sloppily, and was fascinated by his past as a courtier and lover of Marie Antoinette. She tasted exotic foods and iced champagne for the first time.

The ladies prepared for the ball. Emma meticulously dressed. Charles, his trousers tight, asked if he would dance. Emma forbade him, saying it was more appropriate for a doctor to remain seated. The ball began. Emma, at first nervous, soon gave herself up to the music, watching the elegant dancers. She observed a young woman discreetly pass something white into a gentleman's hat.

After supper, the cotillion began. Emma, who did not know how to waltz, was asked by a Viscount. They danced, and Emma felt a ""torpor"" and briefly rested her head on his chest. She continued to waltz with him, attracting attention.

After the guests retired, Charles, exhausted, took off his boots. Emma, still awake, opened the window, breathing in the damp night air, trying to prolong the illusion of this luxurious life. She wished to know the lives of the château's inhabitants. She undressed and lay beside a sleeping Charles.

The next morning, after a quick luncheon, the Marquis showed Emma the stables. Charles, meanwhile, arranged for their departure. The Bovarys paid their respects and left for Tostes. On the road, Emma thought she saw the Viscount among some horsemen. They stopped to mend a broken trace, and Charles found a green silk cigar-case, emblazoned, containing two cigars. He put it in his pocket, despite Emma's scorn for his smoking.

Back in Tostes, dinner was not ready. Emma, in a fit of temper, fired their servant, Nastasie. Charles, fond of Nastasie, was unhappy. Charles smoked one of the found cigars, but Emma, disgusted, threw the cigar-case into the cupboard.

The next day, Emma felt a profound emptiness. The visit to Vaubyessard had created a chasm in her life. She meticulously put away her ball gown. The memory of the ball became her sole occupation, a source of longing and regret for a life she felt she was missing.

**Chapter Nine**
Emma frequently retrieved the green silk cigar case from the cupboard, smelling its scent of verbena and tobacco, associating it with the Viscount and her dreams of Paris. She bought a map of Paris and lady's journals, devouring accounts of high society, fashion, and theatre, seeking imaginary fulfillment. The Viscount's image expanded to encompass all her dreams of a grander life. She saw her immediate surroundings and Charles's ""mediocrity"" as a personal trap, believing true joys and passions existed elsewhere, in luxury and elegance.

The coarse stable-boy contrasted sharply with her romantic ideals. Emma hired a new, young, orphan servant named Félicité, whom she tried to mold into a lady's maid. Félicité secretly stole sugar. Emma often retreated to her room, reading, dreaming of travel, or returning to the convent, wishing to die and live in Paris simultaneously.

Charles, despite his taxing work, found comfort in Emma and the domestic improvements she made, which he saw as ""golden dust"" on his life. His reputation as a doctor grew. Emma, however, grew increasingly irritated by Charles's lack of ambition, his crude habits, and his general mediocrity. She tried to improve his appearance, but it was for her own ""nervous irritation"" rather than for him. She confided her thoughts and readings to Charles, who was an ""ever-open ear,"" but she secretly longed for ""something to happen,"" turning her ""despairing eyes upon the solitude of her life.""

She suffered from dyspnoea and giddiness in spring and hoped for another ball at Vaubyessard, but when it didn't materialize, she fell into a deeper ennui. She abandoned her hobbies. Sundays were particularly mournful. Winter brought cold and intensified her boredom. She wished to speak to the servant but was restrained by shame.

The village life, with its mundane characters and sounds, only highlighted her dissatisfaction. An organ-grinder's music brought her ""echoes of the world"" beyond Yonville, stirring her melancholy. Meal times with Charles became unbearable. Emma neglected her household duties, prompting criticism from Charles's mother, who visited during Lent. Emma's sharp replies silenced her mother-in-law. Emma became capricious and openly contemptuous of everything.

Old Rouault visited, bringing a turkey, and Emma found his country talk tedious. Emma grew pale, had heart palpitations, and suffered from fainting spells. Charles believed her illness was local and considered moving. Emma, consuming vinegar, lost her appetite. Charles decided to move to Yonville-l’Abbaye. One day, while tidying, Emma pricked her finger on a wire from her old wedding bouquet; she threw it into the fire, watching it burn, symbolizing the destruction of her illusions. In March, the Bovarys moved to Yonville-l’Abbaye, with Emma pregnant.

**Part II**

**Chapter One**
Yonville-l’Abbaye is introduced as a stagnant market-town near Rouen, lacking distinct character despite its potential. Key landmarks include a church with a crowded cemetery (where the gravedigger, Lestiboudois, grew potatoes on unused plots), a Greek-temple-like town hall, and Monsieur Homais' prominent chemist shop. Homais' shop is adorned with red and green jars and numerous advertisements for patent medicines, reflecting his scientific pretensions.

On the evening of the Bovarys' arrival, Madame Lefrancois, the busy landlady of the ""Lion d'Or"" inn, prepared for market day. Monsieur Homais, the chemist, expressed his self-satisfaction and criticized the inn's old billiard table, advocating for modern improvements. Binet, the punctual tax-collector, arrived for dinner. The Abbe Bournisien, the curate, came to retrieve his umbrella, but Homais, an infidel, criticized the priest's piety and railed against the clergy, advocating for scientific progress. The ""Hirondelle"" diligence arrived, delayed by Emma's greyhound, which had run off. Emma, angry and blaming Charles, was consoled by Monsieur Lheureux, a draper and fellow passenger, with tales of loyal dogs.

**Chapter Two**
Emma, Félicité (the servant), Lheureux, and a nurse exited the diligence. Charles was asleep. Homais introduced himself, offering his services and homage. Emma, warming her foot by the fire, revealed her skin in the firelight, observed by Léon Dupuis, a notary's clerk bored with Yonville. Léon was delighted to dine with the newcomers.

Homais, concerned about coryza, kept his skull-cap on and began a long, scientific monologue about medicine, hygiene, and the local climate, boasting about his knowledge. Emma, finding him tiresome, turned to Léon, asking about walks. Léon spoke of sunsets and his love for the sea and mountains, evoking a shared sense of romanticism. Homais interrupted, praising Léon's singing. Homais then listed the notable inhabitants of Yonville to Charles and discussed the house Charles was moving into, noting its conveniences. Charles mentioned Emma's preference for reading over gardening. Léon agreed, and they connected over their shared love for literature and the escapism it offered. Emma expressed her dislike for ""commonplace heroes."" Homais offered his library, boasting of his journalistic connections.

After a long dinner, during which Léon and Emma's conversation deepened their ""common sympathy,"" Félicité left to prepare the new house. The guests departed. Emma, arriving at her new, bare home, reflected that each new dwelling marked a new phase in her life, hoping this one would be better.

**Chapter Three**
The next day, Emma saw Léon on the Place and quickly closed her window. Léon, still excited by their conversation, found Yonville life tiresome, but was considered ""well-bred"" there. He enjoyed painting, music, and literature. Homais cultivated his friendship due to a past legal reprimand for practicing medicine without a diploma, hoping to prevent Charles from exposing him. Charles, dull and with few patients, worried about their dwindling finances. Emma's pregnancy delighted Charles, who doted on her. Emma, however, was initially indifferent to the pregnancy, disappointed by budget constraints for the trousseau. She hoped for a son, seeing it as a symbol of freedom.

Emma gave birth to a daughter. Charles announced, ""It is a girl!"" and Emma fainted, her maternal affection somewhat diminished. They eventually named her Berthe, a name Emma remembered from Vaubyessard. Homais acted as godfather, giving gifts from his pharmacy. A celebratory dinner involved Charles's father drunkenly ""baptizing"" Berthe with champagne, angering the curate. Charles's father stayed a month, charming Emma but worrying Charles's mother with his immoral influence.

Emma suddenly desired to see Berthe, who was at a nurse's house. Léon accompanied her. Madame Tuvache, the mayor's wife, observed them and gossiped. On the way to Mere Rollet's house, Emma and Léon walked arm-in-arm, a silent ""languor"" passing between them. At the nurse's, Emma embraced her child, but was quickly irritated by the nurse's requests for supplies. Emma and Léon returned, noticing each other's refined appearance. Léon, increasingly bored with Yonville, felt an ""abyss"" between himself and Emma, uncertain how to pursue his feelings. Emma, on her part, didn't question if she loved him, believing love should be a sudden, powerful force.

**Chapter Four**
As colder weather arrived, Emma moved to the sitting-room, often observing Léon passing by. She felt a shiver when he walked past. Homais continued to visit for dinner, bringing the newspaper, discussing patients, and offering culinary advice. He hinted at Justin's (his apprentice) crush on Félicité. Homais' soirees were poorly attended, but Léon was always present, assisting Emma and playing cards with her, often offering advice. He observed Emma intently, feeling a growing, silent connection. They often looked at engravings and read verses together. A bond of shared literary taste developed. Charles, oblivious, was not jealous. Léon gave Charles a phrenological head and bought cacti for Emma. Binet, the tax-collector, was often seen working on his lathe. Emma gave Léon a rug, leading to local gossip that she was his lover. Léon was tormented by his unexpressed love for Emma, oscillating between fear and desire. Emma, meanwhile, held a romanticized view of love as a ""hurricane,"" unaware that her security was already compromised by her desires.

**Chapter Five**
On a snowy Sunday, Emma, Charles, Homais, Léon, and the Homais children visited a yarn-mill. Emma, leaning on Homais's arm, looked at Charles and was irritated by his ordinary appearance. Léon, by contrast, seemed gentle and beautiful. Homais reacted strongly when his son dirtied his boots in lime. Charles offered his knife, and Emma noted his peasant-like habit. Back in Yonville, Emma reflected on Léon, imagining his love for her, and felt ""a new delight.""

The next day, Monsieur Lheureux, the cunning draper, visited Emma, offering goods on credit and hinting he could lend her money. He discreetly inquired about Charles's patients. Emma, alone after dinner, reflected on her desires. Léon visited, and their conversation was strained. He offered to renew her music subscription, but Emma refused, citing household duties. She feigned anxiety over Charles's late return, praising him. Emma's behavior then shifted: she became more dedicated to housework, church, and Berthe. She brought Berthe home from the nurse, displaying maternal affection. Charles was delighted by Emma's newfound domesticity, which Léon observed with despair, placing Emma on an ""extraordinary pinnacle"" of virtue.

Emma, however, was consumed by desires, rage, and hate, specifically her love for Léon, whose image she cherished in solitude. She watched him, invented reasons to visit his room, but suppressed her feelings, hoping he would guess them. Pride and shame restrained her. Her unfulfilled desires, longing for money, and passion merged into suffering. She was irritated by Charles's lack of awareness and his complacent happiness, which she saw as an ""imbecile insult."" She yearned for Charles to treat her harshly, so she could justify hating him. She experienced hysterical fits, attributing them to ""nerves.""

**Part II, Chapter Six**
One evening, Emma heard the Angelus, and her thoughts drifted to her convent days, longing for spiritual absorption. She met the curate, Abbe Bournisien, whom she tried to confide in about her deeper sorrows, but he continually misunderstood, offering practical advice for physical ailments. Emma left, feeling isolated. Back home, Berthe, playing, accidentally cut herself when Emma irritably pushed her away. Emma, filled with remorse, attended to Berthe. Charles, arriving, downplayed the injury. He had secretly asked Léon to inquire about a daguerreotype of himself for Emma.

Léon, meanwhile, was growing weary of unrequited love and the monotony of Yonville. He decided to move to Paris to finish his law studies, imagining an artistic life. After much delay, he prepared to leave. On the day of his departure, he briefly visited Emma, who was alone. After kissing Berthe, he left, with Emma watching him go, feeling a mix of sadness and hope. Homais, who had accompanied Léon to the notary's carriage, later discussed Léon's Parisian prospects with Charles, speculating about his life there and the dangers of city life.

Homais also mentioned the possibility of an agricultural meeting being held in Yonville.

**Part II, Chapter Seven**
Léon's departure left Emma in a profound melancholy. She recalled their shared moments, cursing herself for not having loved him enough and wishing she had seized their potential happiness. His memory became the focus of her boredom. However, the intensity of her feelings gradually faded with his absence, replaced by habit. She even began to confuse her repulsion for Charles with her lingering affections for Léon.

Emma returned to her old ""vapourish airs,"" buying a Gothic prie-dieu, spending on nail polish, ordering a new gown, and reading. She attempted Italian and serious literature but quickly abandoned them. She had fits of recklessness, like drinking brandy. She grew pale, claimed to be aging, and suffered from fainting spells and spitting blood, to which she was indifferent. Charles, distraught, wrote to his mother, who visited and suggested Emma needed manual labor to cure her ""vapours"" and cease reading ""bad books."" It was decided to cancel Emma's library subscription. After a cold farewell, Charles's mother left.

One Wednesday, Emma saw Rodolphe Boulanger, a wealthy bachelor from a nearby estate, arrive at their house. Rodolphe's ploughman needed to be bled, and Charles performed the operation. Justin, Charles's assistant, fainted, and Emma and Rodolphe attended to him. Emma, bending, revealed her form in her summer dress. Homais arrived, scolding Justin, then conversed with Rodolphe about faintings. Rodolphe paid Charles and left, reflecting on Emma's beauty and Charles's dullness. He resolved to seduce Emma, planning to visit and use the upcoming agricultural show as an opportunity.

**Part II, Chapter Eight**
The annual agricultural show in Yonville was a grand event, with the town hall decorated, a banquet tent erected, and the National Guard drilling. Homais, dressed formally, lectured Madame Lefrancois on the importance of chemistry to agriculture. Madame Lefrancois revealed that Lheureux was foreclosing on the ""Cafe Francais"" proprietor. Homais, shocked, went to greet Emma, who was with Rodolphe.

Rodolphe led Emma away from Lheureux, making light conversation and picking daisies. He hinted at his own sadness and loneliness, captivating Emma, who felt a connection to his passionate outlook. Emma briefly conversed with Lestiboudois, who was renting church chairs. Rodolphe continued to philosophize about the ""conspiracy of the world"" against noble instincts and eternal love, contrasting it with the councillor Lieuvain's platitudinous speech praising government, agriculture, and duty. Rodolphe seized Emma's hand, declaring his destined love for her and his intention to stay with her ""all my life.""

The speeches continued, with awards given to farmers and a humble old servant named Catherine Leroux, who expressed her intent to give her prize money to the curate for masses. Homais, an infidel, found this ""fanaticism"" amusing. The meeting concluded, and Rodolphe escorted Emma home, then waited for the banquet. During the long, noisy banquet, Rodolphe was absorbed in thoughts of Emma. He saw her again during the failed fireworks display, where Homais worried about stray rockets. Emma nestled against Charles, watching the sky, while Rodolphe gazed at her. As they parted, Rodolphe whispered, ""Oh, yes! very beautiful!"" referring to the day.

Two days later, Homais' self-congratulatory article about the show appeared in the local paper, praising his own role and subtly criticizing the clergy.

**Part II, Chapter Nine**
Six weeks passed without Rodolphe visiting. He had deliberately waited, believing absence would heighten Emma's desire. When he finally appeared, Emma turned pale, confirming his belief. He offered vague excuses for his absence and confessed his constant thoughts of her and his nightly visits to watch her house. Emma was deeply moved, calling him ""good."" He declared his love. Their conversation was interrupted by the sound of wooden shoes, and Charles then entered the room. Rodolphe, regaining composure, greeted Charles and claimed to have been discussing Emma's health. Charles, concerned about Emma's heart palpitations, agreed with Rodolphe's suggestion that riding might be beneficial. Emma initially resisted, citing her lack of a horse and riding habit, but Charles insisted she order one. Charles then wrote to Rodolphe, accepting his offer to lend Emma a horse.

The next day, Rodolphe arrived with two saddle-horses. Emma, dressed in her new habit, was charmed by his appearance. Homais, observing their departure, cautioned them about the horses. As they rode, Emma felt a sense of freedom and remoteness from her village. In the forest, Rodolphe removed ferns from her stirrup, and his knee brushed her leg. They dismounted, and Rodolphe passionately declared his love, speaking of their destinies being intertwined. Emma initially resisted, claiming it was ""impossible!"" but eventually, leaning on his shoulder, she slowly surrendered to him, crying, ""Oh, Rodolphe!"" They made love.

As night fell, they returned to Yonville. Emma, transformed by the experience, felt as if something ""more stupendous than if the mountains had moved"" had occurred. Charles, at dinner, commented on her healthy appearance. He then announced he had bought a second horse for her. After Charles left, Emma locked herself in her room, reveling in the idea of having a lover, recalling the heroines of novels and feeling a ""second puberty"" and ""satisfaction of revenge.""

They continued their affair, meeting regularly. Emma expressed her sorrows to Rodolphe, who interrupted her with kisses. They wrote letters, hidden in a wall fissure by the river. Emma, on a whim, visited Rodolphe's house before dawn, surprising him. She continued these early morning visits, navigating muddy paths and cattle. Rodolphe, often asleep, was amused by her unexpected arrivals. Emma explored his room and even smoked his pipe. Their goodbyes were tearful. However, Rodolphe eventually expressed concern that her visits were imprudent and she was ""compromising herself.""

**Part II, Chapter Ten**
Rodolphe's fears about their affair being discovered began to affect Emma. She became anxious, constantly watching for onlookers during her returns from La Huchette. One morning, she encountered Captain Binet, who was duck hunting, and lied about visiting her child at the nurse's (though Berthe had been home for a year). Emma worried Binet would suspect her and gossip. Later, at the chemist's shop, she again saw Binet, buying supplies, which further heightened her anxiety.

Emma and Rodolphe arranged secret rendezvous in the garden at night, with Emma having removed the gate key. Charles's habit of chatting by the fireside often delayed her. Their lovemaking continued, but Emma longed for Rodolphe to be more dramatic. She asked if he carried pistols to defend himself from Charles, which Rodolphe found ridiculous and crude. Emma grew more sentimental, exchanging keepsakes and asking for a wedding ring, romanticizing their love. Rodolphe, accustomed to many women, found her declarations unoriginal and her sentimentality tiresome. His indifference grew, and their passion seemed to lessen.

Old Rouault's annual turkey arrived with a letter, detailing his life and expressing his desire to see Berthe. Emma read it, transported back to her youth and her lost illusions, feeling deeply unhappy. Seeing Berthe playing, she was overcome with a sudden tenderness, washing and embracing her. That evening, Rodolphe found Emma serious, but dismissed it as a ""whim."" He missed three subsequent rendezvous, and when he finally reappeared, Emma was cold and contemptuous. She pondered if she should have loved Charles instead. Just then, Homais provided a new distraction.

**Part II, Chapter Eleven**
Homais, inspired by a new club-foot cure, convinced Charles to perform the operation on Hippolyte, the stable-boy, promising fame and fortune. Emma strongly supported this, hoping to bolster Charles's reputation. Charles, persuaded, studied medical texts. Homais tirelessly convinced Hippolyte, emphasizing the benefits and cost-free nature of the procedure. Hippolyte eventually agreed, pressured by the entire village. Charles, with Emma's suggestion, even procured the complex machine for the operation.

Charles performed the surgery, cutting Hippolyte's Achilles tendon, and was relieved by its apparent success. Hippolyte, surprised, kissed Charles's hands. Homais immediately drafted a glowing article for the ""Fanal de Rouen,"" praising Charles's ""loftiest philanthropy."" Emma, filled with a new tenderness for Charles, felt happy.

Five days later, Hippolyte's condition worsened dramatically. His foot swelled, becoming livid and blistered, infected with gangrene. Charles and Homais had initially ignored his complaints and re-tightened the machine. Hippolyte was in agony, and Mere Lefrancois (the innkeeper) removed him to the billiard room for distraction. Emma visited and comforted him. The Abbe Bournisien visited, offering spiritual comfort, but Homais, indignant, viewed this as priestly ""manoeuvres"" and detrimental to Hippolyte's health. Eventually, Charles consented to call Monsieur Canivet, a renowned doctor.

Canivet arrived, disdainfully examined the mortified leg, and declared it required amputation. He then loudly chastised Homais at the chemist's shop for his ""Parisian inventions"" and the ""asses"" who attempted such operations. Homais, needing to maintain good relations with Canivet for his business, did not defend Charles.

The amputation was a major event in Yonville. Charles remained at home, distraught, fearing ruin and public ridicule. Emma, watching him, felt only contempt for his mediocrity and her own foolishness in believing in him. She recalled her lost desires and the ""sordidness of marriage,"" feeling a surge of pride and reveling in ""the evil ironies of triumphant adultery."" Rodolphe's image returned to her with ""dazzling attractions."" Charles, still oblivious, mumbled about the type of club-foot. Emma bit her lips, fixing a burning gaze on Charles, who now irritated her completely.

Charles, seeking comfort, asked Emma for a kiss. Emma, red with anger, furiously rejected him, slamming the door and breaking a barometer. Charles was overwhelmed. That evening, Rodolphe found Emma waiting for him in the garden, and their rancor melted in an embrace.

**Part II, Chapter Twelve**
Emma and Rodolphe recommenced their affair, with Emma frequently sending for him to complain about her boredom and Charles's odiousness. She pressed Rodolphe to take her away, but he laughed, calling her ""mad"" and avoiding the subject. Emma's tenderness for Rodolphe grew with her repulsion for Charles, who seemed increasingly disagreeable and vulgar. She meticulously prepared herself and her room for Rodolphe, while Félicité and Justin observed. Justin, cleaning Emma's muddy boots, noticed the mud from her rendezvous.

Emma acquired many new items, squandering money, and even had Charles pay for a fancy wooden leg for Hippolyte. Lheureux, the draper, continued to supply Emma with goods on credit, allowing her to indulge her caprices. He delivered a riding-whip for Rodolphe, then presented Emma with a large bill. Emma, having spent her dowry, was embarrassed and struggled to pay. Lheureux threatened to take back the goods. Emma, in a moment of defiance, told him to do so. Lheureux, confident of his leverage, left. Emma, receiving a payment from Charles for some account, hid the money from him. Lheureux later offered a ""deal,"" where Emma paid some cash and signed new bills for the remaining debt, including interest and commission. She drew more money from a sale of a small estate, using some to pay off previous bills, but remaining indebted.

Emma gave Rodolphe a seal, a scarf, and a cigar-case similar to the Viscount's. Rodolphe felt humiliated by these gifts. Emma became more demanding and sentimental, asking him to constantly affirm his love. Rodolphe, however, found her emotional declarations unoriginal and her love an ""idiotic sort of attachment."" He grew indifferent, ceasing his passionate words and caresses. Emma's manners became bolder, even defiant, as she was seen walking with Rodolphe, smoking a cigarette. Charles's mother, visiting, was scandalized by Emma's conduct, leading to a violent quarrel between the two women. Emma, enraged, physically pushed Charles's mother away.

Emma, using a prearranged signal (a piece of white paper on the blind), summoned Rodolphe and begged him to take her away. He agreed, even considering taking Berthe. Emma, now docile with Charles's mother, was consumed by the ""anticipated delight of her coming happiness."" She became more beautiful, radiating joy. Charles, oblivious, thought her irresistible, dreaming of Berthe's future education and marriage. Emma, feigning sleep, dreamed of an exotic, luxurious life with Rodolphe.

She ordered a large cloak and trunk from Lheureux for their elopement, paying with her watch chain. The elopement was set for September 4th. Rodolphe, however, began making excuses, delaying the departure. On the day before, Rodolphe visited Emma and, despite their passionate exchange, expressed doubts, saying ""There is still time!"" Emma impulsively declared she would never repent. Midnight struck, marking the eve of their planned escape. Rodolphe left, and Emma called ""Tomorrow!"" after him. Rodolphe, however, reflected on the ""worry, the expense"" of having a child on his hands, and decided against the elopement, calling it ""too stupid.""

**Part II, Chapter Thirteen**
Rodolphe returned home and sat down to write a letter to Emma. He felt a distance from her already. He retrieved a box of old love letters and souvenirs, including Emma's handkerchief and miniature, but found them uninteresting, seeing all his past lovers as interchangeable. He wrote a letter to Emma, convincing himself he was acting in her best interest, saving her from an ""abyss."" He fabricated reasons for their separation, blaming ""fate"" and the cruelty of the world, and stating he would exile himself. He added a fabricated tear drop to the letter and signed it ""Your friend.""

The next day, Rodolphe sent the letter to Emma, hidden in a basket of apricots delivered by his ploughman, Girard, who was instructed to say Rodolphe had gone on a journey. Emma, receiving the basket, felt apprehension, found and opened the letter, and, terrified, fled to her room. Charles was there, but she was oblivious, running to the attic. She read the letter again, with ""angry sneers,"" but her thoughts became confused, her heart pounding. She contemplated suicide by jumping from the window, drawn by the humming of Binet's lathe. Charles called her, startling her back from the brink.

Félicité called her to dinner. Emma tried to eat but choked, fearing Charles knew everything. Charles, having learned from Girard that Rodolphe had gone on a journey, commented on it, praising Rodolphe's free and ""rakish"" life, oblivious to Emma's distress. Emma, choking, declared it was ""nervousness,"" wanting to be left alone. Suddenly, a blue tilbury passed outside. Emma cried out and fell to the ground, rigid, recognizing Rodolphe on his way to Rouen.

Homais rushed in. The dining table was overturned. Emma was carried to bed, shivering convulsively, then fainted again. She was delirious that night with brain fever. Charles stayed by her side for forty-three days, neglecting his practice, sending for ice and specialist doctors (Canivet and Lariviere). He was most alarmed by her profound prostration.

By mid-October, Emma began to recover. Charles was overjoyed. She took a walk in the garden but refused to sit in the arbour where she had met Rodolphe. Her illness then returned with more complex symptoms. Charles feared cancer. Money troubles also began to plague him.

**Part II, Chapter Fourteen**
Charles faced mounting debts, unable to pay Homais for medicines. Lheureux, the draper, exploited Emma's illness by delivering all the travel items she had ordered (cloak, trunks, bag), then refusing to take them back, forcing Charles to sign a bill. Charles then borrowed more money from Lheureux, incurring significant interest and commission, deepening his debt. Lheureux, a shrewd businessman, profited greatly and expanded his other ventures. Charles worried about repayment, reproaching himself for not constantly thinking of Emma.

Emma's convalescence was slow. She developed an antipathy for the garden and wished her horse to be sold. Her focus shifted entirely to her own well-being. Monsieur Bournisien, the curate, visited frequently, offering religious solace. During her illness, Emma had experienced a spiritual vision after receiving communion, believing herself freed from pain and rising to God. This memory led her to seek saintliness, buying religious items and engaging in excessive charity. However, she found no divine delight, feeling only ""a gigantic dupery.""

She took Berthe home from the nurse and tried to teach her to read. Charles's mother criticized Emma's newfound charity. Emma continued to display a contradictory mix of indifference and affection. Justin, the chemist's apprentice, was captivated by Emma's beauty, but she was oblivious. Emma displayed more wilfulness, dismissing the nurse and other visitors. She also frequented church less.

Homais and Bournisien debated the moral dangers of theatre versus literature. Homais encouraged Charles to take Emma to the theatre in Rouen to see the tenor Lagardy, believing it would be good for her and provoke the clergy. Charles, having received some unexpected money, agreed. They set out in the ""Hirondelle."" Homais, expressing feigned envy, called Emma a ""Venus"" and predicted her success in Rouen.

**Part II, Chapter Fifteen**
In Rouen, Emma saw posters for the opera ""Lucie de Lammermoor"" starring Lagardy. After a brief stroll in the harbor, she and Charles entered the theatre, Emma feeling a vain pleasure in the reserved seats. She observed the elegant, business-minded audience. The orchestra began, and the curtain rose on a country scene. Emma felt transported, identifying with the story and Lucie's longing for love and escape. When Edgar-Lagardy appeared, she was captivated by his passionate performance, feeling she understood his ""intoxication and anguish."" She believed no one had loved her with such intensity as Edgar loved Lucie.

Charles, confused by the plot, asked Emma for explanations, but she impatiently silenced him. Lucie, pale in her wedding dress, reminded Emma of her own wedding and her lost innocence. Emma longed to have ""anchored her life upon some great, strong heart,"" but now believed happiness was a lie. As Edgar sang the sextet, Emma's small criticisms vanished. She imagined his splendid life, feeling he was looking at her, and longed to flee with him.

After the curtain fell, Emma felt suffocated and wanted to leave. Charles went to get barley-water, then returned, announcing he had met Léon. Léon entered their box, and Emma extended her hand, feeling the ""attraction of a stronger will."" She struggled to speak. During the third act, Emma stopped listening to the opera, her thoughts drifting to her past, calmer love with Léon. She felt his warm breath on her hair. Léon proposed they leave for ice cream. Charles, enjoying the opera, initially objected, but then suggested Emma stay alone in Rouen until Sunday. Léon, seizing the opportunity, encouraged this. Charles insisted Emma stay, believing it would benefit her health. Léon paid for their refreshments, adding extra money. Emma, with a ""strange smile,"" stammered that she wasn't sure. Charles told her to think it over and invited Léon to dinner in Yonville. They parted.

**Part III**

**Chapter One**
Léon, now studying law in Paris, had become more confident and worldly. His passion for Emma, which had faded, rekindled upon seeing her again. He resolved to possess her. He felt at ease with her in Rouen, unlike in Paris where he would be intimidated by high society. The night before, he had followed Charles and Emma, then planned his approach.

The next day, Léon visited Emma at the ""Croix-Rouge"" inn. He pretended to have found her by chance, but then admitted to searching for her all morning. Emma apologized for not telling him where they were staying. Emma spoke of her ""eternal complaints,"" the misery of earthly affections, and the heart's isolation. Léon, mimicking her melancholy, spoke of his boredom with law studies and his mother's incessant worries. They revealed their sadness, carefully avoiding explicit confessions of their past or current desires for others.

The room seemed to envelop their solitude. Emma, in a dressing-gown, leaned back, her bare head reflecting in the mirror. She expressed weariness with her complaints. Léon described his own suffering, his walks by the quays, and his fascination with a print of a Muse resembling her. He confessed to writing and tearing up letters to her. Emma listened, making small movements with her toes. She sighed, calling her existence ""useless."" Léon praised virtue and self-sacrifice. Emma wished to be a hospital nurse.

Emma interrupted him, speaking of her almost fatal illness. Léon envied the calm of the tomb, even having made a will wishing to be buried in the rug Emma had given him. They reimagined their past lives, fitting them to an ideal. Emma questioned his desire to be buried in the rug, and Léon confessed, ""Because I loved you so!"" Emma, her face shining, replied, ""I always suspected it."" They recalled details of their past encounters, from the clematis arbour to her clothes. Léon spoke of how she had captivated him. Emma, listening, felt her life expand with these memories.

They heard the clocks strike eight. They held hands, lost in ""ecstasy."" Emma lit candles. She asked Léon why no one had ever expressed such sentiments to her before. Léon explained that ideal natures were hard to understand and expressed regret that they hadn't met earlier. Emma said she was too old, he too young, and that they should remain friends. However, she was moved by his shyness and felt an ""invincible longing"" to kiss him. She glanced at the clock, saying it was late. Léon took the hint. She explained she was supposed to go to the theatre with the Lormeaux family and would be leaving tomorrow. Léon pressed her to see him again, hinting at something ""important—serious."" Emma, after hesitation, agreed to meet him at the cathedral tomorrow at eleven. He kissed her neck passionately.

Emma wrote an interminable letter canceling the rendezvous, but without Léon's address, she planned to deliver it herself. The next morning, Léon meticulously prepared himself, then walked to the cathedral. The square was bustling. Léon, buying a bouquet of violets, felt a swell of pride. He entered the church, encountered the beadle, and waited for Emma, admiring the cathedral. Emma arrived, pale, and handed him a paper, then entered the chapel to pray. Léon was irritated but also charmed by her devotion. Emma tried to pray for divine aid.

They were about to leave when the beadle offered a tour of the church's curiosities. Emma, clinging to ""expiring virtue,"" agreed. The beadle, ignoring Léon's impatience, showed them ancient tombs and relics. Léon, fuming, paid the beadle and seized Emma's arm to leave. The beadle called after them, trying to show them the steeple. Léon, feeling his love ""petrified in the church like the stones,"" fled.

Emma asked where they were going. Léon, without answering, hurried her towards a waiting cab. The beadle, still calling, advised them to see the Resurrection. Léon forced Emma into the cab, telling the coachman to drive ""where you like."" The cab embarked on a wild, circuitous journey through Rouen, passing by numerous landmarks, confusing the coachman, who was desperate for them to stop. People stared at the cab with its drawn blinds. At one point, Emma threw scraps of paper (Léon's letters) from the window. Around six o'clock, the cab stopped in a back street, and Emma, veiled, got out without turning her head.

**Part III, Chapter Two**
Emma arrived back at the inn, surprised the diligence had already left. Despite nothing forcing her to go, she felt a ""cowardly docility"" to return to Charles. She quickly packed, paid her bill, and took a cab to catch up with the ""Hirondelle."" She closed her eyes, opening them only at the foot of the hill near Yonville, where Félicité waited. Félicité told her to go to Monsieur Homais urgently.

At the chemist's, Emma found Homais and his family making preserves. Homais was in a rage because Justin had taken a pan from his ""Capharnaum,"" a sacred laboratory containing dangerous chemicals like arsenic. Homais ranted about Justin's carelessness, the risk of poisoning his family or patients, and his paternal care for Justin. Emma, no longer thinking of her original purpose, left as Homais continued his diatribe. Homais then, as an afterthought, informed Emma that Charles's father had died the evening before from an apoplectic attack.

Charles, who had wanted Homais to break the news gradually due to Emma's sensibility, embraced her tearfully. Emma, at the contact of his lips, shuddered with the memory of Léon. She feigned indifference to Charles's father's death. At dinner, Charles, in distress, sighed that he wished he had seen his father again. Emma, to say something, asked his age. Charles, perceiving her silence as deep grief, tried not to reawaken her sorrow. He asked if she had enjoyed herself yesterday; she said yes. Emma felt only contempt for Charles, longing to be rid of him.

Hippolyte, with his new wooden leg, brought in Emma's luggage. Charles, oblivious to the humiliation, noticed Léon's violets and delicately smelled them. Emma quickly put them in water. Charles's mother arrived the next day, and they mourned. Emma, on the pretext of giving orders, disappeared. Later, Emma and Charles's mother discussed mourning clothes. Emma, meanwhile, was consumed by memories of her rendezvous with Léon.

Lheureux, the linendraper, arrived to offer services, then asked to speak privately with Emma about ""that affair""—the bills Charles had signed. Charles, embarrassed, left them alone. Lheureux congratulated Emma on an inheritance and then subtly reminded her of her debts, including the curtains, carpet, and dresses amounting to two thousand francs. He mentioned a small hovel she owned and suggested she sell it. When she expressed difficulty in finding a buyer, he reminded her of the power of attorney she held. Emma, realizing she could use this, accepted. Lheureux later told her a buyer proposed four thousand francs. Emma was delighted.

Lheureux gave her half the sum and then cunningly presented four new bills for a thousand francs each, explaining that his friend Vincart would discount them. Emma, confused by the calculations, signed the bills, believing she had more money than she did. Lheureux brought her eighteen hundred francs, deducting two hundred for commission and discount.

Emma, with a horizon of ""realisable whims"" before her, paid off some bills but still had others due. Charles, finding a bill, sought an explanation from Emma, who, sitting on his knees, caressed him and cooed, claiming the debts were for indispensable items. Charles, desperate, again turned to Lheureux, signing two more bills. Charles's mother visited, demanding to see the accounts, suspecting Emma's extravagance. Emma quickly had Lheureux create a false account for a smaller sum. Charles's mother criticized Emma's spending. When Charles admitted he had promised his mother to destroy the power of attorney, Emma threw a thick piece of paper (a new power of attorney) into the fire, then had a hysterical laughing fit. Charles, for the first time, defended Emma against his mother, who left in anger, predicting Charles would regret it. Charles, crestfallen, had to persuade Emma to sign another power of attorney, which she did, getting it notarized by Monsieur Guillaumin.

The next Thursday, Emma met Léon at the hotel in Rouen. She was wild and extravagant, laughing, crying, and smoking. She embraced the pleasures of life, walking with him fearlessly in the streets. However, she sometimes felt a shudder at the thought of meeting Rodolphe. One night, she did not return to Yonville. Charles, frantic, searched for her. He eventually found her at the other end of the Rue de la Renelle-des-Maroquiniers, where she claimed she had stayed at Mademoiselle Lempereur's (the music teacher). Emma used this incident to establish her freedom in her escapades. She frequently visited Léon at his office, despite his master's complaints. She exerted increasing control over Léon, dictating his appearance and desires, becoming his ""mistress"" in every sense but the physical. She asked him for love poems, but he could only copy one from a ""Keepsake.""

**Part III, Chapter Three**
Léon, who had frequently dined at Homais's, invited him in return. Homais, eager to experience Parisian life, accepted, despite Madame Homais's tender murmurs of alarm. Homais affected a ""gay Parisian style,"" using slang and questioning Léon about capital customs. One Thursday, Emma was surprised to find Homais at the ""Lion d'Or,"" dressed for travel. Homais had kept his trip secret.

Emma waited three-quarters of an hour for Léon, growing impatient and distressed. They eventually met at a cafe. Homais, intoxicated by the luxury and wine, expounded immoral theories about women and their passions. Léon, despairing, watched the clock. Homais continued to talk, even joking about Léon's ""lady-love"" in Yonville and suggesting it was Félicité, which Léon denied. Homais then launched into an ethnographic digression about women's passions.

Léon, eager to leave, eventually made an excuse to Homais, but Homais insisted on accompanying him. Homais talked incessantly about his wife, children, and business. Léon finally left Homais abruptly, rushed to the hotel, and found Emma in a fit of anger over his delay. She accused him of indifference and reproached herself for her weakness. Léon apologized profusely. Emma's large eyes, filled with tears, settled on him, and he clasped her waist. A servant interrupted, saying Léon was wanted. Emma insisted he return immediately.

Homais, believing he had successfully interrupted Léon's visit, dragged him to Bridoux's to see his dog. Léon, bewildered and heavy from lunch, reluctantly went. He tried repeatedly to escape Homais but was held captive. He finally broke free and rushed back to the hotel, only to find Emma gone. She had left in a rage, detesting him for his perceived weakness and lack of heroism. She accused him of being ""avaricious and cowardly."" Emma then realized she had perhaps maligned him.

Their discussions gradually shifted away from love to more external matters. Emma's letters to Léon became filled with descriptions of flowers and verses, desperate attempts to keep their waning passion alive. She continued to pursue sumptuously expensive rendezvous, often making up the deficit when Léon couldn't pay. He tried to suggest cheaper hotels, but she always refused. She even gave him her old Rouault's wedding spoons to pawn, which annoyed him. Léon began to view Emma's behavior as increasingly odd.

Léon's mother received an anonymous letter warning her of his ""ruin"" with a married woman. His employer, Lawyer Dubocage, intervened, urging Léon to break off the affair. Léon swore he would no longer see Emma, realizing the potential damage to his career and reputation. He grew bored when Emma became emotional, no longer appreciating her delicate expressions of love. He found in adultery ""all the platitudes of marriage.""

Emma, meanwhile, struggled to end the affair herself. She continued to write love letters, but the man she saw in her mind was a phantom of her desires, more real and tangible than Léon. These transports of vague love exhausted her. She felt constant aches and received summonses for unpaid bills.

During Mid-Lent, Emma went to a masked ball in Rouen. She danced all night, surrounded by Léon's companions. She found the company and atmosphere disturbing, feeling frightened and disgusted. She fainted and was taken to a window. As day broke, she saw a cart with iron strips and thought of Berthe. She abruptly left, returning to the Hotel de Boulogne, feeling everything, including herself, was unbearable.

Back at the inn, Félicité gave her a grey paper. It was a summons for a seizure and distraint on her furniture, demanding payment of eight thousand francs within twenty-four hours. Emma was stunned, realizing the magnitude of her debts to Lheureux. She confronted Lheureux, who calmly explained her situation, reminding her of all her past debts and the bills she had signed. He refused to help, then revealed a receipt for eighteen hundred francs from her, implying her ""little theft"" would be revealed to Charles. Emma collapsed. She begged for more time, but Lheureux dismissed her, closing the door.

**Part III, Chapter Three** (continued, as the previous chapter ended with the ""where to, sir?"" section)
The events following Emma's collapse at Lheureux's shop.

**Part III, Chapter Seven**
The next day, Maitre Hareng, the bailiff, and his assistants arrived at Emma's house to draw up an inventory for the distraint. They meticulously listed all their possessions, examining every detail of Emma's life. When they reached the attic, they insisted on opening a desk containing Rodolphe's letters. Maitre Hareng, with a ""discreet smile,"" handled the letters, causing Emma immense anger. After they left, Félicité helped Emma install a man in possession (a guard against further removal of goods) in the attic.

That evening, Charles seemed careworn. Emma watched him with anguish, feeling remorse for her actions and an immense regret for all she had desired and denied herself. Charles placidly poked the fire, oblivious to the man in the attic.

The next Sunday, Emma went to Rouen, desperately seeking money from brokers, but everyone refused. She then hurried to Léon's office, but he was reluctant to let her in, fearing his landlord. They went to their hotel room. Emma, very pale, asked Léon for eight thousand francs, explaining her ruin. Léon called her ""mad"" and a ""coward."" He suggested a smaller sum might stop the proceedings. Emma urged him to try.

Léon returned an hour later, unsuccessful. Emma, frustrated, stamped her feet and murmured that if she were in his place, she would find the money ""at your office."" Her burning eyes and ""lascivious and encouraging"" look made Léon feel weak, urged to commit a crime. He cried out, saying a friend, Morel, might lend him money by tomorrow. Emma seemed disappointed by this hope. Léon left, but Emma had no strength left for any sentiment.

Emma, mechanically obeying habit, returned to Yonville. In Rouen, she saw the Viscount in a tilbury, confirming her past. Feeling lost and overwhelmed, she saw Homais at the ""Croix-Rouge,"" who helped her into the diligence. Homais, criticizing a blind beggar for his ""scrofulous affection"" and laziness, gave him advice and a sou. Emma, disgusted, gave the blind man a five-franc piece, her last money, feeling a sense of grandeur in throwing it away.

Upon reaching home, Emma was stupefied. The next morning, she was awakened by noise in the Place. Justin was tearing down a bill, and the rural guard seized him. Félicité rushed in, handing Emma a yellow paper: all her furniture was for sale. Félicité suggested Emma go to Monsieur Guillaumin, the notary.

Emma, dressed in black, went to the notary's house via a discreet path. She was impressed by the luxurious and meticulously clean house. Guillaumin, a pretentious man, greeted her. Emma explained her situation. Guillaumin, who was secretly associated with Lheureux, already knew the full story of her debts. He listened to her recriminations against Lheureux with a ""singular smile."" He offered her a seat by the stove.

He then began to flirt, touching her hand and arm, breathing pantingly on her cheek. Emma felt oppressed. She sprang up, demanding the money. Guillaumin, shocked, yielded to a ""powerful desire,"" falling to his knees and declaring his love, seizing her waist. Emma flushed purple, recoiled, and cried, ""You are taking a shameless advantage of my distress, sir! I am to be pitied—not to be sold."" She fled.

The notary, stunned, found consolation in looking at his embroidered slippers. Emma, fleeing through the path, was filled with rage and contempt for all men. She felt pursued by Providence. Upon seeing her house, a numbness came over her. Félicité, waiting, asked if she had succeeded. Emma replied ""No!"" They tried to think of others in Yonville who might help, but Emma dismissed everyone. She realized Charles would soon know everything. She imagined confessing, his sorrow, and his forgiveness. She ground her teeth, thinking he would forgive her, but she would never forgive him. This thought of his ""superiority"" infuriated her.

She was tempted to return to Lheureux but saw no use. She regretted not having yielded to Guillaumin. Hearing Charles's horse, she rushed out to the square, where the mayor's wife saw her enter the tax-collector's. Madame Tuvache and Madame Caron secretly observed Binet's attic workshop. They saw Emma speaking to Binet, making gestures. They thought she was asking for time to pay taxes, or even making ""advances."" Binet, a war veteran, recoiled from her, crying, ""Madame! what do you mean?"" The ladies, scandalized, saw Emma flee up the Grande Rue.

Emma reached Mere Rollet's house, gasping, and fell sobbing on the bed. Mere Rollet comforted her. Emma, tormented by the thought of Binet's lathe, murmured, ""Oh, leave off!"" She recalled Léon, then Rodolphe. She suddenly realized Rodolphe was her only hope. She rushed towards La Huchette, oblivious to her ""prostitution.""

**Part III, Chapter Eight**
Emma walked towards La Huchette, her aching heart opening amorously, recalling her first tenderness for Rodolphe. She entered the park, the dogs barked, but no one appeared. She reached Rodolphe's door. Her strength failed her, but necessity drove her in. She found Rodolphe smoking by the fire. He was surprised to see her. She tried to speak, but couldn't. He complimented her unchanged charm. She replied bitterly that her charms were ""poor"" since he disdained them.

Rodolphe offered vague excuses for his past conduct, blaming a secret involving a third person's honor. Emma, swayed by his words, pretended to believe him, or perhaps did. She said she had suffered greatly. He replied philosophically, ""Such is life!"" She pressed him, asking if his life had been good, implying they should not have parted. She took his hand. He struggled against the emotion. She sank onto his breast, saying she couldn't live without him and had been desolate. She accused him of seducing others as he had seduced her, then pleaded for them to ""begin again.""

He drew her onto his knees, caressing her hair. He kissed her eyelids. She burst into tears. Rodolphe, thinking it was love, asked what was wrong. She then revealed, ""I am ruined, Rodolphe! You must lend me three thousand francs.""

Rodolphe, turning pale, slowly rose. He calmly stated, ""Dear madame, I have not got them."" He was not lying, and the text notes that a demand for money is ""the coldest and most destructive"" wind upon love. Emma, in disbelief, repeated, ""You have not got them!"" She accused him of never loving her and being no better than others. She was ""betraying, ruining herself."" Rodolphe declared he was ""hard up"" himself. Emma, enraged, pointed out his expensive possessions (silver on his gun, inlaid clock, silver-gilt whistles), crying that he wanted for nothing, while she would have given him everything, even begged for him. She reminded him of his past promises, his letter, and their plans for elopement, bitterly concluding he repulsed her over three thousand francs.

Rodolphe remained calm, replying, ""I haven't got them."" Emma left, feeling the walls tremble, the ceiling crush her. She stumbled through the dead leaves, her nails breaking against the gate lock. She stopped, looking back at the ""impassive château."" She felt lost, on the verge of madness, her thoughts a ""thousand pieces of fireworks."" She remembered various scenes, feeling only in her love, as if her soul was ebbing from her.

As night fell, she saw Rodolphe's face multiplied in fiery spheres in the air. Her situation, like an abyss, rose before her. In an ""ecstasy of heroism,"" she ran to the chemist's shop. She slipped in through the gate, found Justin in the kitchen, and, with astonishing pallor, demanded the key to the ""Capharnaum"" (Homais's laboratory). She pretended she needed it to kill rats. Justin, presentient of something terrible, was reluctant. Charles's forks clattered in the dining room. Emma, with a sweet, melting voice, insisted Justin light her upstairs. She went straight to the third shelf, seized the blue jar, tore out the cork, plunged her hand in, and swallowed a handful of white powder (arsenic). Justin cried, ""Stop!"" but she silenced him, warning that the blame would fall on Homais.

Emma then went home, feeling a strange serenity. Charles, returning from the news of the distraint, was distraught, crying and fainting. He sent Félicité to search for Emma everywhere. Emma had returned. She sat at her writing-table, wrote a letter, sealed it, and told Charles to read it tomorrow, forbidding any questions. She lay on her bed, feeling a bitter taste. She studied herself, wondering if she felt pain. She heard the clock and Charles's breathing, thinking death was ""but a little thing."" She felt an icy cold creep from her feet to her heart, murmuring, ""Ah! it is beginning."" She began vomiting. Charles noticed a white sediment in the basin, but Emma denied it. She cried out when he touched her stomach. She groaned, growing paler, her pulse almost imperceptible. Sweat oozed from her bluish face; her teeth chattered, her eyes dilated. She smiled once or twice. Her moaning grew louder, a hollow shriek burst from her, and she cried, ""Ah! my God! It is horrible!""

Charles fell to his knees, begging her to tell him what she had eaten. He saw a tenderness in his eyes she had never seen. She faintly said, ""Well, there—there!"" He flew to the writing-table, opened her letter, and read aloud: ""Accuse no one."" He reread it, then cried, ""Poisoned! poisoned!"" Félicité ran to Homais, and the news spread through the village. Charles wandered distraught. Homais went home to write to doctors and cover up the poisoning. Hippolyte and Justin were sent for help. Charles tried to read his medical dictionary. Homais suggested an antidote. Charles showed him the letter revealing it was arsenic. Homais then suggested an analysis. Charles, on the carpet, begged Emma not to cry, saying he wouldn't trouble her anymore. She said, ""It had to be, my dear!"" and caressed his hair.

Emma felt a twilight dimness, her soul absorbed, hearing only Charles's lamentations. She asked for Berthe. Charles brought the child, who was half-asleep and asked where her stockings were. At the mention of ""nurse,"" Emma turned her head away, as if from another bitter poison. Berthe, seeing Emma's pale, hot face, cried out in fear. Charles took Berthe away, sobbing.

Emma's symptoms briefly ceased. Canivet arrived and prescribed an emetic. Emma began vomiting blood. Her lips drew, her body convulsed, covered with brown spots, her pulse weak. She screamed horribly, cursing the poison, imploring it to be quick. Charles, in agony, tried to make her drink. Homais sighed. Canivet was about to administer a theriac when Doctor Lariviere arrived.

Lariviere, a renowned surgeon, examined Emma, frowned, and rubbed his fingers under his nostrils. He tried to take Canivet aside, telling Charles, ""There is nothing more to be done."" Charles, embracing him, begged for help. Lariviere went out to give an order, accompanied by Canivet. Homais, eager for celebrity, offered Lariviere breakfast, boasting his erudition. Justin, bringing plates, dropped them, further frustrating Homais. Lariviere made a brief comment about Homais, then left, dismissing various patients who sought his advice.

Monsieur Bournisien, with the holy oil, came to administer extreme unction. Homais, despite his principles, accompanied Canivet back to Emma's room. Emma lay on her bed, her chin sunken, eyes wide, hands wandering. Charles stood, pale, at the foot of the bed. The priest muttered prayers. Emma slowly turned her face, finding joy in the violet stole, recalling her ""first mystical transports."" She stretched her neck to kiss the crucifix, giving it the ""fullest kiss of love she had ever given."" The priest gave her extreme unction, anointing her eyes, nostrils, mouth, hands, and feet, symbolizing her worldly desires.

Emma seemed calmer, her face serene. The priest suggested God might be prolonging her life. Emma looked around slowly, asked for her looking-glass, and wept. Her chest then began panting rapidly, her tongue protruded, her eyes rolled and grew paler. Félicité knelt, Homais bent his knees, Canivet looked away. Bournisien prayed faster. Charles, on his knees, held Emma's hands, trembling.

Suddenly, the blind man's song was heard from the pavement: ""Maids in the warmth of a summer day / Dream of love, and of love always."" Emma raised herself like a galvanized corpse, her hair undone, eyes staring. ""The blind man!"" she cried, and began to laugh ""an atrocious, frantic, despairing laugh,"" then fell back dead.

**Part III, Chapter Nine**
After Emma's death, Charles collapsed in grief. Homais and Canivet dragged him away. Homais then returned to his shop, having to invent a cover story for the poisoning (that she mistook arsenic for sugar), prepare a sedative for Charles, and write an article for the ""Fanal."" He returned to Charles, who was sitting idly. Homais tried to discuss funeral arrangements, but Charles, in a stammering, frightened voice, refused. Homais tried horticulture as a distraction. The priest eventually reconciled Charles to the funeral plans.

Charles locked himself in his consulting room and wrote his wishes: Emma to be buried in her wedding dress, with white shoes and a wreath, her hair spread over her shoulders, in three coffins (oak, mahogany, lead), with a large piece of green velvet placed over all. Homais found these ideas romantic and extravagant, arguing against the velvet, but Charles angrily dismissed him. The priest took Charles for a walk, discoursing on the vanity of earthly things. Charles blasphemed, saying, ""I hate your God!""

Charles returned to the kitchen. At six o'clock, the ""Hirondelle"" arrived, and he watched the passengers disembark. Félicité made him a bed in the drawing-room, where he fell asleep. Homais and Bournisien sat up with the body, debating religion and philosophy. Charles returned periodically to look at Emma, believing he could revive her with his will.

At daybreak, Charles's mother arrived and burst into tears. Charles became angry when she tried to discuss funeral expenses. He sent her to town to buy what was necessary. Charles remained alone all afternoon. In the evening, visitors came, but everyone was bored. Homais returned with camphor, benzine, and aromatic herbs to combat miasmas. Félicité, Madame Lefrancois, and Charles's mother dressed Emma for burial, placing a wreath on her head. As they did so, a rush of black liquid issued from her mouth. Homais, despite his earlier reluctance, assisted.

Homais and Bournisien continued their debates, dozing off and accusing each other. Bournisien sprinkled holy water, Homais threw chlorine water. They ate and drank. Charles came in to say his final farewell. He lifted Emma's veil, then cried out in horror at her decayed face. They dragged him to the sitting-room. Félicité said Charles wanted some of Emma's hair. Homais, trembling, cut two or three large pieces, leaving white patches in her beautiful black hair.

After more debates and naps, Homais and Bournisien ate and hobnobbed. The undertaker's men arrived. Charles endured the sound of hammering. The next day, Emma was lowered into her three coffins. The bier was too large, so they filled the gaps with mattress wool. The coffin was placed outside. The people of Yonville flocked around. Old Rouault arrived and fainted at the sight of the black cloth.

**Part III, Chapter Ten**
Old Rouault had received Homais's vaguely worded letter thirty-six hours after Emma's death, causing him immense anguish. He rode frantically to Yonville, hallucinating Emma's dead body. He promised the Virgin three chasubles if she were saved. He drank coffee to steel himself. He suspected a mistake, then dismissed it as a joke, until he arrived and fell, weeping, into Charles's arms. Homais intervened, urging dignity.

The funeral procession began. Charles walked erect at the head, feigning bravery. The priests and choristers recited prayers. Hippolyte, with his new wooden leg, appeared in the church. Charles, impatient, threw a five-franc piece into the collection. At the cemetery, the coffin was lowered into the grave. Charles threw handfuls of earth, crying ""Adieu!"" and sending kisses. He was led away, eventually feeling a vague satisfaction that it was over.

Old Rouault smoked his pipe, which Homais disapproved of. Homais noted who was absent from the funeral and criticized the notary's servant for wearing a blue coat. He spread the story of Emma mistaking arsenic for sugar. Charles and Rouault wept together. Rouault decided to return to Bertaux, unable to sleep in the house, refusing to see Berthe. He promised Charles he would never forget his kindness. As he rode away, he turned back for a last look at the village.

Charles and his mother talked late into the night. She decided to live with him in Yonville. Rodolphe slept quietly in his château. Léon also slept. Justin, weeping, visited Emma's grave, where Lestiboudois found him.

**Part III, Chapter Eleven**
The next day, Berthe was brought back, asking for her mamma. Her gaiety broke Charles's heart. Homais offered intolerable consolations. Money troubles resurfaced, with Lheureux pursuing Charles for exorbitant sums. Charles refused to sell any of Emma's belongings, exasperating his mother, who then left.

Everyone began to take advantage of Charles. Mademoiselle Lempereur demanded payment for lessons Emma never took. The circulating library demanded three years' subscriptions. Mere Rollet claimed postage for twenty letters, vaguely attributing them to Emma's ""business affairs."" Charles paid his debts, only to find new ones. He discovered letters Emma had written, forcing him to apologize.

Félicité began wearing Emma's gowns. Charles, seeing her from behind, would sometimes mistake her for Emma. Félicité eventually ran away with Theodore, stealing the remaining wardrobe. Charles received news of Léon's marriage. He wrote congratulations, adding, ""How glad my poor wife would have been!""

One day, Charles found Rodolphe's letter (the one breaking off their elopement) in a secret drawer of Emma's desk. He devoured it, then frantically searched for more. He found Rodolphe's portrait. He was devastated, but the respectful tone of the letter initially led him to believe they had loved ""platonically."" Charles, however, was not one to delve deeply. He lost his vague jealousy in his immense sorrow. He believed everyone must have adored Emma, making her seem even more beautiful to him. He was consumed by a ""lasting, furious desire"" for her, now unrealizable.

To honor Emma, Charles adopted her tastes: patent leather boots, white cravats, cosmetics for his moustache, and even signed notes of hand. ""She corrupted him from beyond the grave."" He sold his possessions piece by piece, stripping their home, but kept Emma's bedroom as it was. He would sit there with Berthe, who was poorly dressed by the charwoman. He mended her toys. He would fall into sad reveries.

No one visited them. Justin had moved to Rouen. Homais's children no longer saw Berthe. The blind man, whom Charles had tried to cure, now disparaged Homais to travelers. Homais, in turn, wrote editorials in the ""Fanal de Rouen"" against the blind man, accusing him of vagrancy and causing accidents, eventually leading to his lifelong confinement in an asylum. This success emboldened Homais, who then attacked clergy, advocated for progress, and pursued the cross of the Legion of Honour, writing petitions to the sovereign. He even designed a grass plot in his garden to resemble the cross.

Charles, still thinking of Emma, found her image fading. He dreamt of her, but she crumbled in his arms. He briefly returned to church, then gave it up. Debts continued to mount. Lheureux refused to renew bills. Charles's mother mortgaged her property for him, but demanded a shawl of Emma's. Charles refused, leading to a final rupture. His affection shifted entirely to Berthe, though her cough and red spots worried him.

Homais's family prospered, fulfilling his ambitions. He was the ""happiest of fathers, the most fortunate of men,"" though still desiring the Legion of Honour. He had grand ideas for Emma's tomb. Charles and Homais consulted an artist and funeral furnishers, eventually deciding on a mausoleum with a ""spirit bearing an extinguished torch"" and the inscription ""Amabilen conjugem calcas"" (Tread upon a loving wife).

One day, Charles met Rodolphe at the Argueil market, where Charles was selling his last horse. They turned pale. Rodolphe stammered apologies, then invited Charles for beer. Charles, lost in thought, gazed at Rodolphe's face, seeing something of Emma in it, and wished he had been that man. Rodolphe, noticing Charles's silent intensity, grew fearful. Charles, with a ""sombre fury,"" fixed his eyes on Rodolphe, then, with a weary lassitude, said, ""I don't blame you now."" He added, ""It is the fault of fatality!"" Rodolphe, who had orchestrated the ""fatality,"" found the remark ""comic even, and a little mean.""

The next day, Charles sat in the arbour, suffocating with vague love influences. Berthe found him, his head thrown back, eyes closed, mouth open, holding a long tress of black hair (Emma's). Thinking he wanted to play, she pushed him. He fell to the ground, dead.

Thirty-six hours later, Monsieur Canivet performed a post-mortem and found nothing amiss. After everything was sold, twelve francs seventy-five centimes remained, which paid for Berthe to go to her grandmother. Charles's mother died the same year. Old Rouault was paralyzed, and an aunt took charge of Berthe, sending her to work in a cotton-factory.

Since Charles's death, three doctors failed in Yonville due to Homais's attacks. Homais now has an enormous practice, is respected by authorities, and protected by public opinion. He has just received the cross of the Legion of Honour."
Mrs. Dalloway-Virginia Woolf,"The plot of ""Mrs. Dalloway"" unfolds over a single day in June, primarily following Clarissa Dalloway as she prepares to host a party, and interweaving her experiences and reflections with those of other characters in London.

The story begins with **Mrs. Clarissa Dalloway** announcing she will buy the flowers for her evening party herself. As she walks through London, she reflects on her past, particularly her youth at Bourton. She recalls her deep affection for Peter Walsh, an old friend who is due back from India, and the painful memory of refusing his marriage proposal, choosing her current husband, Richard Dalloway, instead. She remembers Peter's sayings, his pocket-knife, and his criticisms. Clarissa, now over fifty, feels a sense of her own aging and a certain ""invisibility"" as ""Mrs. Richard Dalloway."" She appreciates the vibrancy of London, contrasting it with memories of the recently concluded War and its casualties.

She encounters her old friend, **Hugh Whitbread**, in the park, who informs her his wife, Evelyn, is unwell. Hugh, a well-dressed man with a minor court position, is invited to Clarissa's party. Clarissa feels a slight resentment and a sense of ""skimpy""-ness in his presence, though she considers him a ""good sort."" She then visits a bookshop, looking for a gift for Evelyn, but finds nothing suitable. She reflects on her life choices, her sense of purpose, and her dislike for **Miss Kilman**, a religious and embittered woman who is close to Clarissa's daughter, Elizabeth. Clarissa feels Miss Kilman represents a ""brutal monster"" of hatred that causes her physical pain.

While Clarissa is at the florist, a loud ""pistol shot"" is heard outside. A motor car with drawn blinds stops opposite the shop, causing a stir and speculation among passers-by about whether royalty or the Prime Minister is inside. Among the onlookers are **Septimus Warren Smith**, a pale, anxious man of about thirty, and his young Italian wife, **Lucrezia (Rezia)**. Septimus is terrified, experiencing visions and believing the world is about to explode. Rezia, desperate and worried, tries to lead him away, recalling his recent threat to kill himself. The car eventually moves on, its unseen occupant inspiring a sense of awe and connection to Empire among some, and irritation in others.

The aeroplane that follows the car, writing letters in the sky, further intensifies Septimus's visions. In Regent's Park, he interprets the smoke letters as divine signals, an ""inexhaustible charity"" of beauty, leading him to tears and profound sensory experiences, where trees seem alive and connected to his body. Rezia, though loving him, is at her wit's end. Dr. Holmes, their general practitioner, has dismissed Septimus's condition, saying there is ""nothing whatever the matter with him."" Rezia feels isolated and tortured by Septimus's erratic behavior, especially his conversations with his dead friend, Evans, and his talk of suicide. She resolves to take him to a specialist, Sir William Bradshaw.

Clarissa returns home, annoyed by the trivialities of party planning and the continued presence of Miss Kilman with Elizabeth. She is deeply affected when she discovers Lady Bruton has invited Richard to lunch but not her, making her feel irrelevant and old. She retreats to her room, recalling intimate moments from her youth, particularly with Sally Seton, which she contrasts with her present, more solitary existence.

Unexpectedly, **Peter Walsh** arrives at Clarissa's house. He has just returned from India. Their meeting is charged with old emotions. Peter observes Clarissa has aged, while she notes his familiar eccentricities, like his pocket-knife. He tells her he is in love with a married woman in India, Daisy, and is seeking a divorce. Overcome with emotion during their conversation about their past, Peter bursts into tears. Clarissa, momentarily sympathetic, reflects on what her life might have been like if she had married him, but ultimately feels a sense of relief that she did not. Peter, in turn, feels Clarissa has become ""cold"" and conventional. He leaves abruptly when Elizabeth enters the room, but not before Clarissa reminds him of her party.

As Peter walks through London, he continues to reflect on Clarissa, his own past, and his current situation. He briefly follows a young woman he idealizes, but this fantasy dissolves. He rests in Regent's Park, where Septimus and Rezia are still present. Septimus experiences renewed visions, believing he is chosen to reveal profound truths to the Prime Minister, but is interrupted by Rezia's concern about their appointment with Sir William Bradshaw.

Septimus and Rezia visit **Sir William Bradshaw**, a renowned specialist. Sir William, after a brief examination, quickly diagnoses Septimus with a severe nervous breakdown and recommends he be sent to a country home for extended rest, separated from Rezia. He dismisses Septimus's suffering as a lack of ""proportion"" and mental balance. Septimus perceives Sir William and Dr. Holmes as oppressive figures, ""torturers"" who represent the brute force of ""human nature."" Rezia, though initially hopeful, is horrified by Sir William's lack of empathy and the prospect of being separated from her husband.

Meanwhile, Richard Dalloway and Hugh Whitbread lunch with **Lady Bruton**. Lady Bruton is primarily concerned with her emigration project and has Hugh draft a letter to _The Times_. They briefly discuss Peter Walsh, recalling his past love for Clarissa and his current ""trouble with some woman."" Lady Bruton falls asleep after lunch, dreaming of her childhood. Richard, eager to tell Clarissa he loves her, buys her roses and walks home, contemplating their life together.

Elizabeth Dalloway, after leaving her mother and Miss Kilman, takes an omnibus through London. She enjoys her freedom and reflects on her desire for a meaningful profession, like becoming a doctor or a farmer, rather than being confined by societal expectations or her mother's parties. Miss Kilman, after being left by Elizabeth at the Army and Navy Stores, feels deep suffering and a sense of abandonment. She seeks solace in Westminster Abbey, attempting to shed her hatred and desires.

Back at his lodgings, Septimus and Rezia share a brief period of quiet happiness, making a hat for a neighbor. Septimus, for a moment, seems to return to his former self, laughing with Rezia. However, his visions return, and when Dr. Holmes forces his way into their room, Septimus, in a desperate act of defiance against what he perceives as Holmes's and Bradshaw's attempts to control him, throws himself from the window onto the area railings, dying instantly.

Later that evening, Clarissa's party is in full swing. Many prominent guests arrive, including the Prime Minister and Lady Bruton. Clarissa greets everyone, including Ellie Henderson, her quiet cousin, and is delighted by the unexpected arrival of her old friend, Sally Seton (now Lady Rosseter), who is married with five sons. Peter Walsh also attends the party, feeling somewhat out of place but observing the social dynamics.

During the party, Lady Bradshaw discreetly informs Clarissa that a young man has killed himself that day. Clarissa, deeply affected by this news, retreats to a small room. She visualizes the young man's death and feels a profound connection to his act. She interprets his suicide as an act of ""defiance,"" an ""attempt to communicate"" the impossibility of reaching a deeper ""centre"" in life. She reflects on Sir William Bradshaw's ""evil"" influence, believing he made life ""intolerable"" for the young man. She grapples with her own life, her past choices, and her perceived failures. Looking out the window, she sees an old lady in the opposite house going to bed, finding solace in the privacy and quiet dignity of this ordinary act, a contrast to the invasive forces of ""love and religion"" (personified by Miss Kilman) that she believes destroy the ""privacy of the soul."" She feels a strange affinity with the dead young man, feeling ""glad that he had done it; thrown it away.""

Clarissa returns to her party, resolved to re-engage with life, and to find Sally and Peter. Peter Walsh, sitting with Sally, wonders where Clarissa has gone. Sally and Peter discuss Clarissa, their past, and their own lives. Sally describes Clarissa as a ""snob"" but also praises her generosity. Peter, in turn, reflects on his complex feelings for Clarissa, realizing that despite everything, it is Clarissa who fills him with ""extraordinary excitement.""

The novel concludes with Peter Walsh's intense realization as Clarissa re-enters the room: ""It is Clarissa, he said. For there she was."""
Pride and Prejudice-Jane Austen,"The narrative begins by establishing a universally acknowledged truth: a single man of good fortune must be in want of a wife. This leads Mrs. Bennet to excitedly inform her husband, Mr. Bennet, that Netherfield Park has been let to a wealthy young man named Mr. Bingley, who possesses an income of four or five thousand pounds a year. Mrs. Bennet immediately envisions him marrying one of her five daughters, particularly her eldest, Jane, whom she considers the most handsome. Mr. Bennet, a man of sarcastic humor and reserve, teases his wife about her aspirations, though he secretly intends to make the first call on Mr. Bingley, only revealing this to his family after the fact.

Mr. Bingley soon returns Mr. Bennet's visit, but the ladies of the household only manage to observe him from a window. An invitation to dinner is extended, but Bingley declines due to a trip to London. Mrs. Bennet fears he will not settle in the neighborhood, but her anxieties are somewhat allayed by the news that he is gathering a large party for the upcoming Meryton assembly.

At the assembly, Mr. Bingley is described as handsome, lively, and agreeable, dancing every dance and showing clear admiration for Jane Bennet. Accompanying him are his two sisters, Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, her husband Mr. Hurst, and a friend, Mr. Darcy. Mr. Darcy, a man of ten thousand a year, initially draws attention for his fine appearance but quickly earns general dislike due to his proud and disagreeable manners, refusing to dance with most ladies. Elizabeth Bennet overhears him remark that she is merely ""tolerable"" and ""not handsome enough to tempt me,"" leading to her strong prejudice against him. Despite this, the evening is generally pleasing for the Bennets, as Jane receives significant attention from Mr. Bingley, and her sisters enjoy the ball.

The Bingley sisters express a desire to know Jane and Elizabeth better, but Elizabeth perceives their supercilious nature. Jane, meanwhile, is evidently falling in love with Bingley, though her composed demeanor hides her true feelings. Elizabeth's friend, Charlotte Lucas, sagely advises Jane to show more affection to secure Bingley, arguing that happiness in marriage is often a matter of chance, not deep understanding. Elizabeth, however, believes Jane's genuine affection should suffice. Unbeknownst to Elizabeth, Mr. Darcy begins to find her intelligent and pleasing, despite his initial dismissal of her looks.

At a party at Sir William Lucas's, Elizabeth notices Darcy's increasing attention. Sir William tries to push Darcy to dance with Elizabeth, but she playfully refuses. Miss Bingley, observing Darcy's interest, attempts to mock Elizabeth, but Darcy counters by stating he was meditating on the ""pleasure which a pair of fine eyes...can bestow,"" explicitly naming ""Miss Elizabeth Bennet."" Miss Bingley responds with sarcastic remarks about a potential marriage to Elizabeth.

The Bennet family's financial situation is revealed: Mr. Bennet's estate is entailed away from his daughters to a distant cousin, Mr. Collins, and Mrs. Bennet's fortune is modest. The arrival of a militia regiment in Meryton becomes the new obsession for Kitty and Lydia, overshadowing even Mr. Bingley. Jane receives a dinner invitation from Miss Bingley, which Mrs. Bennet manipulates to ensure Jane must stay overnight by forcing her to ride on horseback in the rain. Jane falls ill, and Elizabeth walks three miles through the mud to care for her at Netherfield, earning the contempt of the Bingley sisters but the kindness of Mr. Bingley. Mr. Darcy is torn between admiration for Elizabeth's spirit and reservations about her family's social impropriety.

While Elizabeth is at Netherfield, she observes Miss Bingley's constant, fawning attempts to engage Mr. Darcy, which he mostly ignores. She also witnesses the Bingley sisters' disdain for her family's ""low connections."" Mr. Darcy reveals his own ""implacable resentment"" and confesses his fault is ""a propensity to hate everybody,"" to which Elizabeth retorts that his defect is ""wilfully to misunderstand them.""

Elizabeth's mother and younger sisters visit Netherfield. Mrs. Bennet, oblivious to social niceties, loudly promotes Jane's marriage to Bingley, even in Darcy's hearing, much to Elizabeth's mortification. Lydia rudely reminds Bingley of his promise to host a ball, which he agrees to. Darcy, feeling too much attraction to Elizabeth and disliking Miss Bingley's teasing, resolves to guard his admiration.

Upon returning home, Elizabeth learns of Mr. Collins's impending visit. His letter, filled with self-importance and servility towards his patroness Lady Catherine de Bourgh, announces his intention to visit Longbourn and ""make amends"" for inheriting the estate by marrying one of the Bennet daughters. He initially intends to marry Jane but is diverted to Elizabeth by Mrs. Bennet's hints.

Mr. Collins formally proposes to Elizabeth, delivering a pompous speech detailing his reasons for marrying (clergyman's duty, happiness, Lady Catherine's advice) and his generous intention to choose a wife from the Bennet daughters as compensation for the entail. Elizabeth firmly rejects him, but he misinterprets her refusal as female coyness. Elizabeth insists she is serious and could not be happy with him. Mrs. Bennet, furious, tries to force Elizabeth to accept. Mr. Bennet intervenes, telling Elizabeth that while her mother will disown her if she doesn't marry Collins, he will disown her if she does. Elizabeth is relieved by her father's support. Mr. Collins, his pride hurt, shifts his affections.

Charlotte Lucas accepts Mr. Collins's proposal, seeking a ""comfortable home"" and ""honourable provision"" rather than love. Elizabeth is deeply disappointed and shocked by her friend's pragmatic decision, believing Charlotte has sacrificed her feelings for worldly advantage. Mrs. Bennet is outraged, blaming Elizabeth for the ""mischief"" and Lady Lucas for her ""artful"" daughter. News spreads that the Bingley family has left Netherfield for London and has no intention of returning. Jane is heartbroken, though she tries to convince herself and Elizabeth that Bingley's affections were not serious or were misled. Elizabeth, however, believes Bingley's sisters and Mr. Darcy deliberately interfered to prevent the match, wanting Bingley to marry Miss Darcy, who has a large fortune and is Darcy's cousin.

Mrs. Gardiner, Elizabeth's aunt, invites Jane to stay with them in London for a change of scene. Elizabeth learns that Wickham has shifted his attentions to Miss King, a young woman who has recently inherited ten thousand pounds, confirming Elizabeth's suspicions of his mercenary nature. Elizabeth, Sir William, and Maria Lucas visit Charlotte and Mr. Collins in Hunsford, Kent. Mr. Collins proudly displays his parsonage and his frequent visits to Rosings, the grand estate of Lady Catherine de Bourgh. Lady Catherine, an imperious and opinionated woman, questions Elizabeth about her family, manners, and education, criticizing their lack of a governess and their younger sisters' early introduction to society.

Mr. Darcy and his cousin, Colonel Fitzwilliam, arrive at Rosings. Colonel Fitzwilliam is amiable and engages Elizabeth in conversation. During their discussions, Colonel Fitzwilliam inadvertently reveals that Mr. Darcy ""lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage"" due to ""very strong objections against the lady."" Elizabeth immediately understands he is referring to Bingley and Jane, and realizes Mr. Darcy was the primary architect of their separation.

Later, Mr. Darcy unexpectedly calls on Elizabeth and, in an agitated manner, declares his ardent love for her. However, he also describes his ""sense of her inferiority,"" the ""degradation"" of the connection, and the ""family obstacles"" he had to overcome. Elizabeth is deeply offended by his proud declaration and firmly rejects him, accusing him of ruining Jane's happiness and of behaving cruelly and unjustly towards Mr. Wickham, whose story she still believes. Darcy, with equal vehemence, admits his role in separating Bingley and Jane, citing the impropriety of her family's conduct and Jane's apparent indifference. He then provides a detailed account of Wickham's true character: Wickham squandered his inheritance, refused the church living offered by the late Mr. Darcy, and later attempted to elope with Mr. Darcy's fifteen-year-old sister, Georgiana, for her thirty thousand pound fortune. Darcy had intervened, saving his sister from infamy. He explains that Colonel Fitzwilliam can corroborate these facts.

Elizabeth is shocked and profoundly humbled by Darcy's letter. She realizes she has been blind, prejudiced, and absurd in her judgment of both men. She feels intense shame for her previous harsh opinions of Darcy and her foolish trust in Wickham's charming facade. She understands the justice of Darcy's criticisms of her family's impropriety and feels deeply distressed by how their conduct has affected Jane's prospects.

Shortly after, Lydia elopes with Mr. Wickham from Brighton, not to Scotland as originally believed, but towards London, with no intention of marriage. Jane and Elizabeth are distraught. Mr. Bennet goes to London to search for them, and Mr. Gardiner soon joins him. Mr. Collins writes a cruel letter, expressing sympathy but also condemning Lydia and asserting that this disgrace will ruin the marriage prospects of all the other Bennet daughters. He congratulates himself on not marrying Elizabeth.

Mr. Gardiner eventually locates Lydia and Wickham. They are not married, and Wickham never intended to be. Mr. Darcy, having tracked them down in London, intervenes. Out of a sense of responsibility (believing his own pride and reserve had allowed Wickham's true character to remain unknown), and a desire to spare Elizabeth's family further disgrace, he takes it upon himself to arrange the marriage. He pays all of Wickham's considerable debts (over a thousand pounds), provides him with an additional thousand pounds, settles another thousand on Lydia, and purchases Wickham a commission in the Regulars, to be stationed far in the north. He manages to convince Wickham to marry Lydia, and Mr. Gardiner is reluctantly forced to accept these terms on Mr. Bennet's behalf.

The news of Lydia's marriage brings immense relief to the Bennets, though Mrs. Bennet remains oblivious to the extent of their obligation to Darcy, believing Mr. Gardiner paid for everything. Mr. Bennet is ashamed but grateful. Lydia and Wickham return to Longbourn before heading north. Lydia remains unrepentant, boisterous, and entirely unaware of the scandal she caused. She lets slip that Mr. Darcy was present at her wedding, further perplexing Elizabeth.

Bingley returns to Longbourn, accompanied by Mr. Darcy. Bingley, having been told by Darcy of his mistake regarding Jane's feelings, renews his attentions to her. Elizabeth, now aware of Darcy's true character and his profound intervention for Lydia, feels immense gratitude and a growing affection for him. Bingley proposes to Jane, and she joyfully accepts. Mrs. Bennet is ecstatic, only focused on the wealth and status of the match, now completely forgetting her previous dislike of Darcy.

Elizabeth tells her father about her engagement to Mr. Darcy. Mr. Bennet, surprised, initially questions her, reminding her of her former dislike and fearing she will be unhappy in an unequal marriage. Elizabeth, with tears, assures him of her love and explains her changed estimation of Darcy, also revealing Darcy's generosity in securing Lydia's marriage. Mr. Bennet, deeply moved, gives his consent. Mrs. Bennet is overcome with joy, focusing solely on Darcy's immense wealth.

Elizabeth later playfully asks Darcy how he fell in love with her, to which he replies he cannot pinpoint the moment, but was captivated by the liveliness of her mind and her difference from other women. He confesses his proud upbringing and admits Elizabeth's reproofs at Rosings humbled him and taught him to be a better man. He reveals Lady Catherine's attempt to break off his supposed engagement to Elizabeth had the opposite effect, convincing him of Elizabeth's genuine character. He had also confessed to Bingley his mistake about Jane, which led to Bingley's renewed suit.

Elizabeth writes to Mrs. Gardiner, expressing her overwhelming happiness and inviting them to Pemberley. Mr. Bennet writes to Mr. Collins, informing him of the engagement and advising him to ""stand by the nephew."" Miss Bingley sends insincere congratulations but soon drops her resentment to maintain her connection to Pemberley. Lady Catherine is ""extremely indignant"" at Darcy's marriage, but after a period of estrangement, Elizabeth persuades Darcy to seek reconciliation, and Lady Catherine eventually visits them at Pemberley.

The story concludes with Elizabeth and Darcy happily married at Pemberley, and Jane and Bingley, after a year, settling on an estate near Pemberley. Kitty, separated from Lydia's negative influence, improves. Mary remains at home. Wickham and Lydia, though financially supported by Darcy, remain extravagant and unsettled, and Wickham's affection for Lydia fades. Darcy and Elizabeth maintain close ties with the Gardiners, grateful for their role in bringing them together."
Robinson Crusoe-Daniel Defoe,"The narrative begins with Robinson Crusoe, born in York in 1632 to a German father and a mother whose family name was Robinson (from whom he derived ""Crusoe""). He had two elder brothers, one of whom was killed in a battle in Flanders. Crusoe, the third son, had a strong inclination to go to sea, despite his aged father's earnest advice to pursue a quiet, middle-class life. His father tearfully warned him against seeking adventure, citing the tragic death of his elder brother who also disregarded parental counsel.

Despite his father's powerful plea, Crusoe's desire for a wandering life persisted. About a year later, at eighteen, he left home without his parents' consent, taking a free passage on a ship bound for London from Hull. Almost immediately, a violent storm arose, terrifying Crusoe and leading him to vow repentance and a return home if spared. However, after the storm abated and his companion mocked his fear, Crusoe drowned his repentance in drink.

A few days later, while anchored in Yarmouth Roads, an even more dreadful storm struck. The ship became severely disabled and sprung a leak. In a desperate attempt, the crew, including a terrified and fainting Crusoe, were rescued by a boat from another ship just before their own vessel foundered. They were taken to Yarmouth, where they received aid. Despite the harrowing experience and the master's fervent warnings to never go to sea again, Crusoe, ashamed to return home, traveled to London.

After some time, he embarked on a voyage to the coast of Guinea (Africa). He went as a gentleman, not a sailor, but learned navigation from the ship's honest captain. This first voyage was successful; he traded £40 worth of goods for gold dust, which yielded almost £300 in London. However, he suffered a violent fever (calenture) during the trip.

Soon after, the good captain died. Crusoe, with £200 remaining, embarked on a second Guinea voyage. This proved disastrous. Their ship was attacked and captured by a Turkish pirate from Sallee. Crusoe was taken as a personal slave by the pirate captain, while the rest of his crew were sent inland. He worked in his master's garden and on the ship, constantly plotting escape but seeing no opportunity for two years.

An opportunity arose when his master, during a long stay ashore, frequently went fishing in a pinnace, taking Crusoe and a young Moorish boy named Xury. Crusoe became adept at fishing. One day, the master sent Crusoe, Xury, and another Moor, Moely, with a well-equipped long-boat (taken from Crusoe's original English ship) for a fishing and fowling trip, including extra provisions and guns. Crusoe seized this chance to escape. He gathered additional supplies, including biscuit, water, cordial waters, beeswax, tools, gunpowder, and shot, often tricking Moely.

Once at sea, Crusoe threw Moely overboard at gunpoint, threatening to shoot him if he returned to the boat but promising him safety if he swam to shore. Moely, an excellent swimmer, made it to land. Crusoe then secured the loyalty of young Xury by promising him to make him a ""great man"" if he was faithful. Xury swore allegiance.

Crusoe steered south along the African coast for five days, well beyond Moorish territory. They landed in a river mouth for water, enduring terrifying nights filled with the sounds of wild beasts. A large, furious animal (believed to be a lion) approached their boat at night, which Crusoe repelled by firing his gun. The next day, after a brave offer from Xury, they both went ashore. Xury shot a hare-like creature for food and found fresh water. Later, they encountered two leopards; Crusoe shot one, amazing the local naked natives who had gathered. He gave them the meat and received the skin.

Continuing south, Crusoe hoped to encounter a European ship. He eventually spotted a Portuguese ship, bound for Brazil. He signaled it, and they rescued him and Xury. The generous captain refused payment and agreed to take them to Brazil, promising to free Xury in ten years if he converted to Christianity.

In Brazil, Crusoe was introduced to a sugar planter and decided to become one. He bought land and arranged for £100 of his money in London to be sent to him in goods. The Portuguese captain, acting as his faithful agent, brought him tools, utensils, a negro slave, and an indentured European servant. Crusoe prospered, but his ambition led him to agree to a secret slave-trading venture to Guinea with other planters.

On September 1, 1659, exactly eight years after his first ill-fated voyage, Crusoe sailed again from Brazil. The ship encountered a violent hurricane, then a second storm that drove them far off course. The ship struck a sandbank near an unknown island. The crew attempted to escape in a boat, but a massive wave capsized it, drowning everyone except Crusoe, who was miraculously washed ashore.

Crusoe found himself alone, without food or weapons. He spent the first night sleeping in a tree for safety. The next morning, he discovered his ship had floated closer to shore and was still upright. Over several days, he made eleven trips to the wreck on rafts he constructed, salvaging invaluable provisions, tools (including a carpenter's chest and a grindstone), weapons, ammunition, clothes, and eventually, money. He also brought two cats and his dog, who had swum ashore. During one trip, a storm broke the ship into pieces, making further salvage impossible.

He chose a spot on a rising hill with fresh water, shelter, and a sea view. He built a fortified dwelling: a tent within a strong fence of stakes and cables, further reinforced by a cave dug into the rock behind it. He organized his salvaged goods and created a calendar on a post to mark the days. A lightning storm made him realize the danger to his gunpowder, so he separated it into numerous small parcels and hid them. He learned to hunt goats, and even captured a kid that became tame.

He kept a journal, detailing his daily activities and reflections. He philosophized on his ""debtor and creditor"" account of good and evil, finding reasons for thankfulness despite his solitude. He learned to make primitive furniture, earthenware (discovering how to fire pots), a wooden mortar and pestle for grinding corn, and sieves from cloth. He experimented with farming, losing his first crop of barley and rice by sowing at the wrong time, but learning the island's two annual growing seasons. He also tamed a group of goats, eventually building enclosures for them, and learned to make butter and cheese.

In his 23rd year, Crusoe saw a fire on his side of the island. He observed nine naked savages holding a cannibal feast. He was filled with horror and rage, spending months planning revenge, but then reconsidered the morality of attacking them. He decided to remain hidden. He discovered a hidden cave in the woods, a more secure retreat, where he moved his gunpowder and spare arms.

In his 24th year, he heard a gun fired at sea during a storm. He lit a signal fire and discovered a Spanish shipwreck on the rocks. He found a drowned boy and eventually ventured to the wreck in his boat, rescuing a dog and salvaging more useful items, including money (which he found useless).

He returned to his original cave and continued his life. One day, he found a footprint on the sand, terrifying him greatly. He feared being discovered by savages. This led him to strengthen his fortifications even further, creating a double wall and a thick grove of trees to conceal his dwelling. He also continued to raise his goat herd, now having a reliable source of meat and milk.

After a long period of apprehension, he resolved to actively seek contact with the ""white bearded men"" (Spaniards) Friday had mentioned were living with his people on the mainland. Friday, who had by this time become a devoted and Christian servant, eagerly agreed to help, even offering to die with Crusoe. Crusoe and Friday built a large canoe suitable for an ocean voyage.

As they prepared for their trip, three canoes of savages landed on the island. Crusoe, with Friday's help, armed himself and attacked the cannibals, who were about to kill and eat a European prisoner. Crusoe and Friday fired upon them, killing several. Crusoe then freed the European, who turned out to be a Spaniard. The Spaniard, though weak, joined the fight. During the battle, they discovered another prisoner in one of the canoes – Friday's own father.

Crusoe, Friday, Friday's father, and the Spaniard were now a small community. They ensured the remaining savages fled, burying the dead. The Spaniard revealed that 16 more of his countrymen and Portuguese were living as castaways on the mainland, in poor conditions. The Spaniard, showing prudence, suggested they wait six months to cultivate more land and ensure enough food for all 17 men before bringing them to the island. Crusoe agreed, and they diligently worked the land, yielding a plentiful harvest.

After securing ample provisions, Crusoe sent the Spaniard and Friday's father to the mainland in one of the canoes to bring the other castaways, having them swear an oath of allegiance and obedience. While Crusoe awaited their return, an English ship unexpectedly appeared off the coast.

Crusoe, wary due to the ship's unusual presence and his ""secret hints"" of danger, observed them. He saw eleven Englishmen land, three of whom were bound prisoners. He realized they were mutineers who had marooned their captain, his mate, and a passenger. The mutineers carelessly allowed their boat to become stranded at low tide.

Crusoe, after making contact with the distressed captain, offered assistance under two conditions: that he would retain authority on the island, and that he and Friday would receive free passage to England if the ship was recovered. The captain readily agreed. Crusoe, with Friday and the captain's two loyal men, launched a surprise attack on the mutineers, killing or subduing them. The ship's captain then used a clever deception, convincing the remaining mutineers that Crusoe was a powerful governor with a large garrison.

After securing the ship, Crusoe and the captain dealt with the remaining mutineers. Crusoe offered them a choice: be taken to England for trial and certain hanging, or be left on the island. They chose to stay. Crusoe left them his firearms, ammunition, tools, and detailed instructions on how to manage the island, plant crops, raise goats, and live peacefully with the expected Spaniards. He also made them promise to treat the 17 Spaniards as equals.

On December 19, 1686, after 28 years, 2 months, and 19 days on the island, Robinson Crusoe departed for England, taking his goat-skin cap, umbrella, one parrot, and his accumulated money (which had grown tarnished). He arrived in England on June 11, 1687, a stranger after 35 years.

He found his old benefactor, the widow, in poverty and helped her. His parents were dead, and his family reduced, but he found two sisters and two nephews. He received a reward of almost £200 from the owners of the rescued ship. He then traveled to Lisbon to inquire about his Brazilian plantation. He found his old Portuguese captain, who informed him that his plantation had thrived, making his partner wealthy, and that Crusoe's share was substantial. He was now a very rich man.

After settling his affairs in Lisbon, compensating his old captain, and arranging for his Brazilian income to be managed, Crusoe decided to return to England. Driven by an aversion to sea travel (which later proved prescient, as two ships he considered taking were lost), he traveled overland through Spain and France with Friday and a small company. During this journey through the Pyrenees, they faced dangerous encounters with packs of wolves and a bear, in which Friday displayed remarkable courage and skill.

Finally, Crusoe arrived safely at Dover on January 14. He managed his new wealth, sold his Brazilian estate for a large sum, and continued to help his family. He eventually married, had three children, but his wife died. Years later, still feeling a ""wandering life"" inclination, he embarked on another voyage to the East Indies with his nephew, visiting his island colony along the way. He found the settlers prospering, having fought off Caribbeans and expanded their community with rescued men and women from the mainland, resulting in about twenty children. Crusoe left them more supplies, tools, and two workmen. He also sent more people and livestock from Brazil. The narrative concludes with Crusoe stating he would recount his further adventures and the colony's history in a ""Second Part of my Story."""
Six Characters in Search of an Author-Luigi Pirandello,"This play opens on a stage set for a rehearsal, half-dark and empty, with props scattered about. A theater company is preparing to rehearse ""Mixing It Up,"" a play by Pirandello. The Manager is frustrated with the play's convoluted nature and the Leading Man's complaints about his part.

Suddenly, six mysterious figures, known as the Six Characters, enter the stage, bathed in a ""tenuous light."" They are: The Father, a man of about 50, both ""mellifluous and violent""; The Mother, a ""crushed and terrified"" woman in black; The Step-Daughter, ""dashing, almost impudent, beautiful,"" also in mourning; The Son, a severe and contemptuous young man of 22; The Boy, a timid 14-year-old; and The Child, a girl of about four.

The Father explains that they are characters in search of an author, claiming their creator conceived them but failed to complete their drama. They want the Manager to stage their story, asserting that they are ""more alive"" and ""truer"" than actors. The Manager is initially dismissive, but the Characters' insistence and the unfolding intensity of their story pique his interest.

The Step-Daughter impulsively reveals that she is a ""two months' orphan"" and provocatively flirts with The Manager, pointing to The Father and implying a shameful past. She then reveals that she, The Boy, and The Child are ""bastards"" and that The Son despises them and their common mother. The Mother nearly faints, and The Father tries to comfort her, revealing she was once his wife. The Manager is confused, as The Step-Daughter stated The Mother was a widow.

The Father explains that The Mother had a lover, now dead, and that her true drama lies in her four children from two men. The Mother protests, claiming The Father forced her away to be with the other man. The Step-Daughter contradicts this, suggesting The Mother's accusation is to gain sympathy from The Son, whom she abandoned at two years old. The Father admits he sent The Mother away, partly for her freedom and partly for his own liberation, driven by his ""aspirations towards a certain moral sanity"" and his inability to live with her out of pity. He claims to have later watched her new family with ""pure interest.""

The Step-Daughter mockingly recounts how The Father would wait outside her school when she was a child, bringing her gifts, until her mother discovered him. She then reveals that after her stepfather's death, their family faced ""absolute misery."" The Mother, despite being barely literate, took work as a modiste at Madame Pace's shop. The Step-Daughter implies that Madame Pace, under the guise of selling clothes, exploited young girls. One day, The Father, a former client of Madame Pace's, encountered The Step-Daughter there. He recognized The Mother ""in time"" before anything more happened, and brought them all back to his house.

The Step-Daughter expresses her disgust at having to live in The Father's house, especially under The Son's contemptuous gaze. The Son, in turn, voices his deep shame and discomfort with the entire situation, feeling like an ""unrealized"" character forced to witness his family's sordid history. He claims to have ""nothing to do with it."" The Father insists that The Son's aloofness and the shame felt by The Boy (who resembles his deceased biological father) are central to the drama. He outlines the eventual tragic climax: The Child's death, The Boy's tragedy, and The Step-Daughter's flight.

Intrigued, The Manager agrees to attempt to stage their story, asking The Father to be his ""author"" by dictating their story. The characters and Manager retreat to his office, while the actors express their bewilderment and annoyance.

In Act II, The Step-Daughter, The Child, and The Boy emerge from the office, with The Step-Daughter expressing frustration at the Manager's arrangements. She discovers The Boy hiding a revolver. The Son further articulates his shame at having his parents' private lives exposed.

The Manager then begins to set the stage for Madame Pace's shop, with The Step-Daughter insisting on specific details. He instructs the Prompter to take down the story in shorthand as the Characters act it out. The Father argues that actors cannot truly represent them because their ""souls"" and ""temperaments"" are unique and real, unlike the actors' portrayals. The Step-Daughter bursts into laughter when the Leading Lady is cast as her, stating the actress is ""not in the least like me.""

To everyone's astonishment, by placing hats and mantles on stage pegs as articles of trade, Madame Pace herself materializes on stage. The Mother, seeing Madame Pace, erupts in a furious outburst, calling her a ""murderess,"" forcing Madame Pace to leave, unwilling to act in The Mother's presence.

The scene between The Father and The Step-Daughter in Madame Pace's shop begins. The Father, playing his part, attempts to take off The Step-Daughter's hat, noticing her youth and mourning dress. The Mother, watching, is deeply distressed. The Step-Daughter passionately protests the Manager's desire to sanitize the scene, insisting on the ""truth"": The Father's actual words (""Well, let's take off this little frock"") and her subsequent act of shame behind a screen. She asserts that The Father is responsible for all her ""faults"" and wants the full horror of her story to be shown. The Mother cries, unable to bear the re-enactment. The Father and Step-Daughter intensely describe the climax of their shared shameful moment. The Mother rushes forward, separating them and calling The Father a ""brute."" The Manager, thrilled by the drama, shouts ""curtain,"" but the Machinist accidentally drops the curtain, prematurely ending the act.

Act III begins with the stage reset as a garden. The Characters continue to argue with The Manager about how their drama should be presented. The Father emphasizes that for them, the ""illusion"" of the stage is their ""sole reality,"" claiming that characters have a fixed, immutable reality, unlike transient human beings. He argues that he is ""crying aloud the reason of my sufferings,"" not philosophizing. He recounts how their author abandoned them, refusing to give their story life on stage.

The Manager tries to stage a scene in the garden. The Step-Daughter insists The Son's constant isolation in his room and The Boy's indoor movements make an all-garden setting impossible. When The Manager tries to get The Boy to hide behind trees, The Step-Daughter states he won't speak as long as The Son is present. The Son eagerly offers to leave, but The Step-Daughter mocks him, saying he is ""obliged to stay here, indissolubly bound to the chain.""

The Manager attempts to create a scene between The Mother and The Son, with The Mother entering his room to express her anguish. The Son vehemently denies such a scene, stating he simply left the room to avoid it. The Father tries to force The Son to participate, questioning his ""guts to be a son."" The Son resists, claiming to uphold the author's original will to not put them on stage.

Under intense pressure, The Son finally reveals what happened: The Child had gone to the fountain. He ran to save her but witnessed The Boy ""standing stock still, with eyes like a madman's, watching his little drowned sister, in the fountain!"" As The Step-Daughter bends over the fountain, sobbing, a revolver shot rings out from behind the trees where The Boy was hidden. The Mother screams and rushes towards the sound. Actors confirm The Boy is ""dead!"" while others declare it ""only make believe."" The Father cries out, ""Pretence? Reality, sir, reality!"" The Manager, completely overwhelmed and exasperated, declares, ""Pretence? Reality? To hell with it all! Never in my life has such a thing happened to me. I've lost a whole day over these people, a whole day!"" The curtain falls."
The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn-Mark Twain,"Huckleberry Finn (Huck) begins by explaining that he was featured in *The Adventures of Tom Sawyer*, written by Mr. Mark Twain, and that he and Tom Sawyer became rich after finding money hidden by robbers in a cave, each receiving six thousand dollars. Judge Thatcher invested their money, providing them a dollar a day. The Widow Douglas adopted Huck to ""sivilize"" him, a life Huck found rough and confining. He initially ran away, but Tom Sawyer convinced him to return by promising him membership in a band of robbers if he became respectable.

Life at the Widow's included wearing new clothes, attending regular meals with blessings, and learning about biblical figures like Moses, in whom Huck lost interest upon discovering he was dead. Miss Watson, the Widow's sister, also lived there, teaching Huck spelling and scolding his manners. She spoke of the ""good place"" (heaven) and ""bad place"" (hell), but Huck found no appeal in her version of heaven, especially since Tom Sawyer wouldn't be there. That night, feeling lonesome and superstitious after a spider incident, Huck slipped out to meet Tom.

They crept through the Widow's garden, narrowly avoiding detection by Jim, Miss Watson's ""big nigger,"" who was sleeping by the kitchen door. After Jim fell back asleep, Tom wanted to tie him to a tree for fun but Huck objected, fearing Jim would wake and reveal Huck's absence. Tom then snuck into the kitchen for candles, leaving five cents in payment, and subsequently placed Jim's hat on a tree limb above him without waking him. Jim later embellished this event, claiming witches bewitched and rode him across the state, making him a local celebrity among other ""niggers"" who came to hear his stories. Jim wore the five-cent piece as a charm from the devil.

Huck and Tom met other boys, including Joe Harper and Ben Rogers, in an old tanyard. They stole a skiff, traveled two and a half miles downriver, and entered a hidden cave. There, Tom formed ""Tom Sawyer's Gang,"" making members swear a bloody oath to keep secrets, kill anyone who harmed a member's family, and remain hungry and sleepless until a cross was carved on the victim's breast. Huck, lacking family, offered Miss Watson as a target, which was accepted. The gang's business was ""robbery and murder,"" specifically as ""highwaymen"" who would stop carriages, kill people, and take their valuables. Some victims, Tom explained from books, would be ""ransomed"" (held until they died). Ben Rogers questioned killing women, but Tom said they would be brought to the cave, treated politely, and would fall in love with their captors. Little Tommy Barnes, scared, threatened to tell secrets, so Tom paid him five cents to keep quiet. They agreed to meet the next week for their first ""robbery."" Huck returned home, his new clothes dirty.

Miss Watson scolded Huck for his dirty clothes the next morning, but the Widow was kind. Huck's attempts to pray for fishhooks failed, and Miss Watson called him a fool. He concluded prayer only worked for ""spiritual gifts,"" meaning helping others. Huck's father, Pap, had been absent for over a year. A drowned man was found and identified as Pap, but Huck realized it was a woman in men's clothes because drowned men float face down, not on their back. This left Huck uneasy, expecting Pap to reappear.

The robber gang disbanded after about a month, having only pretended to rob. Huck found no profit in it. Tom once summoned the gang for a supposed ambush of Spanish merchants with elephants and diamonds, but it was just a Sunday-school picnic. Tom claimed magicians had enchanted the scene. Huck tried to summon genies with a lamp and ring but failed, concluding Tom's stories were lies.

Months later, Huck was attending school, learning to read and write a little. He was getting used to the Widow's ways. One morning, he spilled salt, a bad luck sign. Outside, he found Pap's distinctive boot tracks in the snow. Fearing Pap would take his money, Huck rushed to Judge Thatcher and tried to give all his six thousand dollars (and interest) to the Judge, who agreed to ""buy"" it for a dollar. That night, Huck consulted Jim and his magic hair-ball. After Huck supplied a counterfeit quarter (which Jim prepared by sticking it in a potato to make it pass), the hair-ball predicted Pap was undecided about leaving or staying, Huck would have joy and trouble, and should stay away from water due to a risk of being ""hung."" Huck returned to his room to find Pap waiting for him.

Pap, looking ragged and sickly, immediately confronted Huck about his civilized appearance and education. He forbade Huck from going to school, read from a book, and then threw it. Pap tore up a picture Huck received for good lessons and threatened him with a ""cowhide."" He demanded Huck's money. When Huck said he had none (having given it to Judge Thatcher), Pap took his remaining dollar and went for whisky. Pap was later jailed for a week after getting drunk. The new judge tried to reform Pap, taking him into his home, but Pap feigned repentance, then stole whisky, broke his arm falling off the porch, and almost froze to death. The judge concluded only a shotgun could reform him.

Pap continued to trouble Huck and Judge Thatcher for money. Huck occasionally borrowed money from the Judge for Pap, which Pap used to get drunk and get jailed. Pap also harassed the Widow. One day, he abducted Huck, taking him three miles upriver to a remote log hut on the Illinois shore, where he kept Huck prisoner. Pap locked Huck in when he left to trade fish and game for whisky, and would beat him when drunk. Huck initially enjoyed the wild, uncivilized life but Pap's increasing beatings and long absences (once for three days) made him determined to escape. He found a rusty wood-saw hidden in the roof and began sawing a section of a log to create an escape hole. Pap returned in a bad mood, complaining about the lawsuit for Huck's money and a new trial to give Huck to the Widow. Pap ranted against the government, especially for allowing a free black man to vote. In a drunken rage, he tripped and cursed. Huck fell asleep while Pap was still awake, groaning. Huck woke to Pap suffering delirium tremens, hallucinating snakes and devils, then chasing Huck with a knife. Huck escaped his jacket, and Pap eventually collapsed. Huck retrieved Pap's gun and pointed it at him, waiting for him to stir.

The next morning, Pap, with no memory of the previous night, sent Huck to check fish lines. Huck found a valuable drift-canoe, which he hid for his escape. He staged his own murder: he loaded the canoe with supplies, created a drag mark by pulling a heavy sack to the river, shot a wild pig and used its blood on an ax, dumped the pig's body downriver, and made a trail of meal leading to a lake to suggest robbers had killed him and taken his possessions. He planned to escape to Jackson's Island. After dark, he heard Pap returning in a skiff, sober. Huck silently paddled downstream, past the ferry-landing, and reached Jackson's Island, hiding his canoe.

Huck woke late to the sound of a cannon ""boom!"" from the ferryboat, realizing the townspeople were searching for his ""carcass"" by firing cannons over the water. He caught a loaf of bread, which had quicksilver in it, a superstitious method to locate drowned bodies. He observed the ferryboat, full of townspeople including Pap and Tom Sawyer, searching the island. He hid as they passed. The search continued, but eventually, they gave up. Huck made a camp. After three days of exploring the island, he found a still-smoking campfire, startling him. He hid his supplies and climbed a tree. That night, he heard men in the woods on the Illinois bank. He decided to find out who was on the island. He paddled stealthily and at dawn, found Jim.

Jim initially thought Huck was a ghost. Huck reassured him. Jim revealed he had escaped from Miss Watson after overhearing her plan to sell him down to New Orleans for $800. He hid in a cooper shop, heard the townspeople discussing Huck's ""murder,"" and then floated downriver on a raft, landing on Jackson's Island. He had been living on ""rubbage"" since. Jim shared various superstitions about bad luck, including handling snake-skins, but also good luck, like hairy arms meaning future wealth. He claimed to have been rich once but lost money speculating. He proudly declared himself rich now because he ""owns [him]sef"" and is ""wuth eight hund'd dollars.""

Huck and Jim found a large cavern, which they made their camp, moving all their possessions. A severe summer storm hit, confirming Jim's weather prediction. The river rose for days. They explored the flooded island by canoe, observing tame animals. One night, they salvaged a section of a lumber raft. Another night, they boarded a wrecked two-story frame-house floating downriver. Inside, they found a dead man, shot in the back. They salvaged various items including clothes, books, a spy-glass, and a wooden leg. They also found eight dollars in silver sewn into a coat. Jim believed the dead man was murdered. Huck hid Jim under a quilt in the canoe as they returned to camp to avoid detection.

Huck wanted to discuss the dead man, but Jim feared bad luck. Jim's bad luck prediction came true when Huck, after killing a rattlesnake, placed it on Jim's blanket as a prank. The snake's mate bit Jim. Jim used Pap's whisky as a cure, leading to swelling and delirium. Jim was laid up for four days. Huck vowed never to handle a snake-skin again. They caught a massive catfish and found a spool in its stomach. Bored, Huck decided to explore the town, disguised as a girl. He met Mrs. Judith Loftus, who informed him of the town's belief that Pap killed Huck, or that Jim did, and that there was a $300 reward for Jim and a $200 for Pap. She also revealed her husband and another man were going to Jackson's Island after midnight to search for Jim. Huck nearly revealed himself by mixing up his assumed name. Mrs. Loftus, after testing Huck with country questions and observing his un-girlish movements, exposed him as a boy. Huck confessed to being a runaway apprentice and invented a new backstory, heading to Goshen. Mrs. Loftus corrected his location and offered him assistance, warning him to take the rocky river road. Huck immediately raced back to the island, warned Jim, and they quickly loaded their raft and fled downriver.

They drifted for days, enjoying the peaceful river life, fishing and observing nature. Huck reflected on Jim's superstitions and Tom Sawyer's imaginative lies. They avoided towns at night, but Huck occasionally went ashore to buy food, sometimes ""borrowing"" items. Jim and Huck discussed stars and Jim's family. One morning, Huck encountered two men fleeing from a mob. He helped them escape to the raft. The men introduced themselves as a runaway doctor/preacher (the older man) and a runaway printer/actor (the younger man), both frauds. The younger man claimed to be the rightful ""Duke of Bridgewater,"" and the older man later declared himself the ""late Dauphin,"" Louis XVII. Huck quickly saw through their lies but played along to avoid conflict.

The king and duke, now calling themselves ""Royalty"" and ""Your Grace,"" interrogated Huck and Jim about their presence. Huck invented a story about their raft being run over by a steamboat, drowning Pap and his younger brother, and how people tried to claim Jim, forcing them to travel at night. The duke then devised a plan: they would print a fake handbill for Jim, claiming he was a runaway ""nigger"" from a distant plantation, and pretend to have captured him to allow them to travel in daylight. That night, a storm hit while the king and duke were in the wigwam, leaving Huck and Jim to stand watch. Huck was washed overboard by a wave but Jim found it funny. The next day, the duke planned their next scam: a Shakespearean performance. He would be Romeo and Richard III, and the king would be Juliet and Richmond, despite his age and appearance. The duke began teaching the king Hamlet's soliloquy.

They arrived at a rundown Arkansas town. Huck observed the lazy loafers and a dramatic street fight between old Boggs, a town drunk, and Colonel Sherburn. Sherburn calmly shot and killed Boggs at 1 PM as warned. A mob gathered to lynch Sherburn, who appeared on his roof with a gun and scornfully shamed them as cowards, causing them to disperse. Huck then went to a circus, where he witnessed a skilled rider disguised as a drunken man. That night, the duke and king's Shakespeare show was a flop, with only twelve people laughing at them. The duke, realizing the audience wanted ""low comedy,"" created a new handbill for ""THE ROYAL NONESUCH !!!"" with the line ""LADIES AND CHILDREN NOT ADMITTED.""

The new show was a massive success, packing the house with men. The king, painted naked and striped, cavorted on all fours, making the audience roar with laughter. The duke announced only two more nights due to ""London engagements."" The audience realized they had been ""sold"" but were convinced by a ""jedge"" to promote the show to the rest of the town so everyone would be ""in the same boat."" The trick worked for two nights, making the king and duke $465. On the third night, Huck noticed men coming with bulging pockets, carrying rotten produce, indicating they planned to retaliate. The duke and Huck quickly fled to the raft, followed by the king, who had never actually gone to town. They celebrated their haul.

Jim expressed his dismay at the ""kings'"" behavior, but Huck, citing historical examples, maintained that ""kings is kings, and you got to make allowances."" Jim shared a heartbreaking story about his deaf daughter, 'Lizabeth, whom he had cruelly slapped before realizing her condition, causing him immense guilt.

The frauds, now broke again, continued their unsuccessful scams. They started planning something worse. Huck and Jim decided to abandon them at the first chance. The king went ashore to Pikesville to scout. When he didn't return by midday, Huck and the duke went to find him, discovering him drunk and being mocked by loafers. Huck seized the opportunity and ran back to the raft, hoping to escape with Jim. But Jim was gone. A boy told Huck that Jim, a runaway ""nigger,"" was captured and held at Silas Phelps's place for a $200 reward. An old stranger had sold his claim to the reward for $40.

Huck was devastated. He struggled with his conscience, first considering writing to Miss Watson to have Jim returned, then rejecting the idea, fearing Jim would be sold further south or disgraced. He tried to pray but couldn't, realizing his heart was not ""right"" because he still secretly intended to help Jim. He resolved to embrace ""wickedness"" and steal Jim out of slavery. He wrote a letter to Miss Watson, but then, remembering Jim's kindness and friendship, he tore it up, declaring, ""All right, then, I'll _go_ to hell."" He made a plan to retrieve Jim.

Huck hid his raft, sank his canoe, and disguised himself in his store clothes. He approached Phelps's plantation. The first person he met was the duke, posting a bill for the ""Royal Nonesuch."" Huck lied, saying the king was drunk, he lost a sheep, and when he returned to the raft, it was gone with Jim. The duke, realizing the king had sold Jim for $40 and lost the money, blamed Huck for stealing the raft. Huck, pretending to be angry about ""his nigger"" being sold, refused to betray them. The duke, after some hesitation, lied to Huck, telling him Jim was at Abram Foster's, forty miles away, to ensure Huck was out of the way. Huck pretended to leave for Foster's but instead doubled back to Phelps's.

Huck arrived at the Phelps's plantation, which looked peaceful on a Sunday. He was greeted by Aunt Sally, who mistook him for Tom Sawyer, her nephew. Huck played along, improvising a story about a steamboat cylinder-head blowing up and killing a ""nigger."" Aunt Sally believed him, delighted that ""Tom"" had finally arrived. Uncle Silas, a kind farmer and preacher, also welcomed him. Huck was comfortable being ""Tom Sawyer,"" but nervous about the real Tom arriving. He decided to intercept Tom.

Huck met Tom Sawyer on the road. Tom, initially thinking Huck was a ghost, was thrilled to learn Huck was alive and playing a trick. Huck explained his predicament, and Tom, excited by the ""adventure,"" agreed to impersonate Sid Sawyer, Tom's brother. Huck then revealed Jim was imprisoned at Phelps's and he planned to free him. Tom, to Huck's astonishment, eagerly agreed to help, not caring about the social implications. They swapped trunks, and Huck returned to the Phelps's. Tom arrived later, greeted by Aunt Sally (who now thought Huck was Tom, and Tom was Sid). Tom, enjoying the role-play, exaggerated his greetings, even kissing Aunt Sally, who was initially furious but then overjoyed to have ""Sid"" there.

At supper, a little boy mentioned seeing the ""runaway nigger"" and how he had told Uncle Silas about the ""scandalous show,"" implying the king and duke were exposed. Huck and Tom, sharing a room, sneaked out and went to town to warn the king and duke. They found the king and duke tarred and feathered, being ridden out of town on a rail by a mob. Huck was sickened by the cruelty.

Back at Phelps's, Tom quickly deduced that Jim was imprisoned in the hut by the ash-hopper. He approved Huck's simple plan to dig Jim out but insisted on adding more ""difficulties"" to make it a proper ""adventure"" from his books. He dismissed Huck's practical suggestions, demanding they use case-knives to dig, create a rope ladder from sheets, make pens from pewter spoons and brass candlesticks, use Jim's blood for ink, and carve mournful inscriptions and a coat of arms (with a ""runaway nigger, sable"" and ""bar sinister"") onto a grindstone. Jim and Huck filed away at the pens. They stole a grindstone from the mill and, with Jim's help, brought it back to the cabin. Tom then instructed Jim to keep various ""dumb pets"" like spiders, garter-snakes, and rats, and play a jew's-harp for them. Jim found these tasks onerous but agreed.

They dug with picks and shovels, pretending they were case-knives, and made a hole into Jim's cabin. They woke Jim, who was overjoyed but wanted a quick escape. Tom explained his elaborate plans for a ""regular"" escape. Jim agreed, believing ""white folks knowed better."" They smuggled a piece of candlestick in a corn-pone for Jim, who nearly broke his teeth. Hounds emerged from under Jim's bed, causing Nat, Jim's feeder, to scream ""Witches"" and collapse. Tom dealt with the dogs and calmed Nat. They continued with their preparations for three weeks, completing the pens, journal, inscriptions, and sawing off the bed-leg. Uncle Silas's attempts to return Jim to his supposed owner failed. Tom then devised a plan for ""nonnamous letters"" to be sent to warn the town, along with him (as Jim's mother) and Jim (in Aunt Sally's dress) switching clothes for the escape. Huck, dressed as a ""servant-girl,"" delivered the first anonymous letter. They then put pictures of skulls, crossbones, and coffins on the doors, terrifying Aunt Sally. A final letter was planted on a sleeping ""nigger"" guard, claiming a gang of cutthroats would steal Jim at midnight and instructing the Phelpses to lock them in.

That night, Huck forgot the butter for their lunch. When he went to retrieve it from the cellar, he encountered Aunt Sally. He hid the butter in his hat. Aunt Sally, suspicious, sent him to the sitting-room, where he found fifteen armed farmers waiting for the ""desperadoes."" As Aunt Sally interrogated him, the butter melted down his face. She thought he had ""brain-fever"" and sent him to bed. Huck raced to Tom, warning him of the armed men. Tom was thrilled, seeing it as part of the ""adventure."" They heard men fumbling at the padlock. The men entered the cabin, unaware of Huck, Jim, and Tom, who slipped out through the hole. Tom's pants caught on the fence, making a noise, and they were discovered. Shots were fired, and dogs were released. Huck, Jim, and Tom fled for the river. The dogs, recognizing them, paid them no mind. They reached Huck's canoe, then the raft.

On the raft, Huck declared Jim free. Tom then revealed he had been shot in the leg. Jim insisted on getting a doctor. Tom protested, saying it was ""unregular,"" but Huck and Jim held firm. Tom reluctantly gave instructions for blindfolding the doctor, making him swear silence, giving him money, and leading him on a roundabout route to prevent him from marking the raft with chalk.

Huck found a kind old doctor and spun a tale about his brother (Tom) accidentally shooting himself while hunting on Spanish Island. The doctor, suspicious of the canoe, took it himself, leaving Huck to wait. Huck fell asleep and later learned the doctor was gone. He ran into Uncle Silas, who asked where ""Tom"" (Huck) had been. Huck lied about searching for the ""nigger"" with ""Sid"" (Tom) and missing him. At the Phelps's house, Aunt Sally was overjoyed to see ""Tom,"" then Mrs. Hotchkiss and other neighbors loudly recounted the elaborate ""nigger"" escape, concluding ""sperits"" must have helped since the dogs never tracked them. Aunt Sally realized ""Tom and Sid"" (Huck and Tom) were the culprits and locked them in their room. Huck, feeling guilty, promised Aunt Sally he wouldn't cause her any more grief.

The next morning, Uncle Silas returned, having found no trace of ""Tom."" Aunt Sally, about to open a letter from Aunt Polly, saw the real Tom Sawyer being brought in on a mattress, with the doctor and Jim (in Aunt Sally's calico dress, tied). Huck hid the letter. Aunt Sally, thinking Tom was dead, then realized he was alive. Huck followed the men, who initially wanted to hang Jim as an example but decided against it, fearing payment to his owner. They chained Jim in the cabin. The doctor praised Jim's faithful nursing of Tom, calling him a ""good nigger...worth a thousand dollars."" The men softened their stance, promising not to cuss Jim anymore.

Tom, recovering, excitedly revealed to Aunt Sally the entire elaborate escape plan, including all the stolen items and the animals in Jim's cabin. Aunt Sally was furious but Tom was proud. Tom then declared Jim was free, revealing that Miss Watson had died two months ago and freed Jim in her will, ashamed she had ever considered selling him. Tom admitted he orchestrated the elaborate escape purely for the ""adventure."" At that moment, Aunt Polly, Tom's real aunt, entered, having come to check on Tom and ""Sid."" Aunt Polly recognized Tom and Huck, exposing their identities to the Phelpses. Aunt Polly confirmed Miss Watson's will.

In the end, Jim was freed and treated well by the Phelps family for his help. Tom gave Jim forty dollars for his patient ""imprisonment,"" fulfilling Jim's prediction of becoming rich. Tom then proposed new adventures among the ""Injuns."" Huck, thinking he had no money (assuming Pap took it), was told by Tom that his six thousand dollars was still safe with Judge Thatcher, as Pap had never returned. Jim then solemnly revealed that the dead man in the floating house they had seen earlier was Pap, confirming Huck's earliest suspicion. Tom, nearly recovered, wore the bullet from his leg on a watch-guard. Huck, weary of the process of writing a book and facing adoption and ""sivilization"" by Aunt Sally, declared he would ""light out for the territory ahead of the rest."""
The Count of Monte Cristo-Alexandre Dumas,"On the 24th of February, 1815, the three-master *Pharaon* arrives in Marseilles. Edmond Dantès, the young and capable first mate, reports the death of Captain Leclere and is praised by the shipowner, M. Morrel, who promises him the captaincy. This news elates Edmond, who is engaged to the beautiful Catalan girl, Mercédès. However, it also stirs fierce jealousy in Danglars, the supercargo, and Fernand Mondego, Mercédès' cousin who is also in love with her.

Edmond first visits his father, finding him in poverty, having paid a debt to Caderousse. Edmond gives his father his savings and promises a better life. He then goes to Mercédès, who rejects Fernand's advances, affirming her love for Edmond. Fernand is left seething with hatred. Danglars and Fernand conspire at a tavern, fabricating an anonymous letter denouncing Edmond as a Bonapartist agent carrying secret letters from Napoleon at Elba to a committee in Paris. Fernand posts the letter, while Caderousse, drunk, is vaguely aware of the plot.

At Edmond and Mercédès' wedding feast, Edmond is dramatically arrested by a magistrate and soldiers. Edmond is taken to M. de Villefort, the Deputy Procureur du Roi. Edmond truthfully recounts his voyage, including his stop at the Island of Elba to deliver a packet for Marshal Bertrand, where he briefly encountered Napoleon. Upon reading the anonymous letter, Villefort is horrified to discover it is addressed to his own father, M. Noirtier, a prominent Bonapartist. To protect his own royalist reputation and impending marriage into an aristocratic family, Villefort burns the letter—the only proof against Edmond—and condemns Edmond to indefinite imprisonment in the Château d'If, dismissing M. Morrel's pleas for mercy.

Edmond endures years of solitary confinement, battling despair and even attempting suicide by starvation. After four years, he hears a scratching sound and discovers another prisoner, the Abbé Faria, who has been digging an escape tunnel. They become close friends, and Faria educates Edmond extensively in various languages, sciences, history, and philosophy, transforming him into a highly intelligent and cultured man. Faria also reveals the location and details of the immense Spada family treasure on the deserted island of Monte Cristo, discovered from a partially burned will, making Edmond memorize the details.

Faria suffers three catalepsy attacks. During the third, fatal attack, Edmond switches places with Faria's corpse in the burial sack. He is thrown into the sea, weighted by a cannonball, but cuts himself free with a knife (made by Faria) and swims to the island of Tiboulen. He is rescued by a smuggling ship, *La Jeune Amélie*, and works with the crew, learning their trade. He transforms his appearance, cutting his hair and beard, becoming unrecognizable.

Edmond, now a rich and powerful figure known as the Count of Monte Cristo, begins to implement his elaborate plan of reward and retribution. He first returns to Marseilles, discovers his father died of starvation and Mercédès has disappeared. Disguised as the Abbé Busoni, he visits Caderousse, who is now a poor innkeeper. Caderousse, believing he is confessing, reveals the full extent of Danglars and Fernand's roles in Edmond's betrayal and his father's death. Monte Cristo gives Caderousse a diamond, explaining it was Edmond's legacy, but Caderousse's greed leads him to murder a jeweler (Joannes) for it, and he is eventually caught and sentenced to the galleys.

Monte Cristo, disguised as a clerk, also visits M. Morrel, who is facing imminent bankruptcy. Morrel's last ship, the *Pharaon*, is overdue. Monte Cristo extends his debts and later orchestrates the miraculous arrival of a new ship, identical to the *Pharaon*, saving Morrel from ruin and restoring his family's fortune. He also sends a diamond for Morrel's daughter, Julie, as a dowry.

Years later, in Paris, Monte Cristo has established himself as a prominent and mysterious figure. He introduces Major Bartolomeo Cavalcanti and his supposed son, Andrea Cavalcanti (who is actually Benedetto, the escaped galley-slave and Caderousse's former accomplice), into Parisian society as wealthy Italian noblemen, using them as pawns in his scheme against Danglars.

Fernand Mondego, now the Count of Morcerf, a decorated general and peer of France, is exposed in the House of Peers by Haydée, Monte Cristo's Greek slave and adopted daughter. Haydée testifies that Fernand betrayed her father, Ali Tepelini, Pasha of Yanina, to the Turks, receiving money in exchange for his family. This public accusation, based on documents provided by Monte Cristo, completely disgraces Fernand, leading to his ruin and later suicide.

In the Villefort household, tragedy strikes. Madame de Villefort, driven by avarice, systematically poisons her husband's first in-laws, the Saint-Mérans, and the loyal servant, Barrois, to secure Valentine's inheritance for her son, Edward. Dr. d'Avrigny, the family physician, suspects poisoning but is reluctant to accuse. However, M. Noirtier, Valentine's paralyzed grandfather, having built an immunity to brucine (which d'Avrigny administered for his condition), secretly protects Valentine by giving her small, increasing doses of the same poison, making her resistant.

Maximilian Morrel, who secretly loves Valentine, discovers her supposed death and attempts to take his own life. Monte Cristo intervenes, revealing his true identity as Edmond Dantès and the entire conspiracy. He explains he had been watching over Valentine and exchanged her poisoned draughts for an antidote, causing her to appear dead but actually placing her in a cataleptic state.

Benedetto (Andrea Cavalcanti) is arrested for Caderousse's murder. At his trial, he publicly reveals that M. de Villefort is his father, describing the circumstances of his birth and abandonment. Villefort, overwhelmed by this devastating exposure of his past crime, descends into madness. He rushes home to find his wife, Héloïse, and their son, Edward, dead, having committed suicide by poison. Villefort, clutching the body of his child, begins digging frantically in the garden, searching for the child he buried alive years ago.

Albert de Morcerf, witnessing his father's public disgrace and suicide, confronts Monte Cristo. Mercédès, who had recognized Edmond earlier, pleads with him to spare Albert. Edmond, moved by her anguish, reveals his identity and the full truth to Albert. Albert, rejecting his father's tainted name and fortune, apologizes to Monte Cristo, takes his mother, and leaves for Africa to start a new life, having accepted a small sum from Edmond—the same money Edmond buried in their old Marseilles garden. Mercédès chooses a life of humble seclusion.

Danglars, having fled Paris with his remaining millions, is captured by Luigi Vampa's bandits in Italy. Vampa, acting on Monte Cristo's orders, starves Danglars and forces him to pay exorbitant sums for food, gradually depleting his fortune. Finally, Monte Cristo reveals himself to the broken and penniless Danglars as Edmond Dantès, reminding him of his past cruelties. He leaves Danglars with 50,000 francs, revealing that the millions Danglars stole from the hospitals have been recovered.

Monte Cristo reunites Maximilian and a recovered Valentine on the Island of Monte Cristo. He gives them the Spada treasure as a wedding gift, and urges them to live happily, reminding Maximilian that true wisdom is found in ""Wait and hope."" Haydée, who has remained devoted to Monte Cristo, confesses her love, which he accepts. Monte Cristo and Haydée depart on his yacht, leaving the reunited lovers to their new life."
The Decameron-Giovanni Boccaccio,"The Decameron begins with a Proem where the author, Giovanni Boccaccio, reflects on a past ""high and noble passion"" that caused him great suffering, from which he found solace in the discourse of a friend. Now free from its bonds, he desires to offer similar comfort to ladies who, being more constrained and unable to distract themselves from lovesickness or melancholy, are in greater need of solace than men. He proposes to achieve this by recounting one hundred stories, told over ten days, by a company of seven ladies and three young men. These tales will offer delightful and useful lessons on various love-chances and accidents of fortune.

**Day the First**
The narrative proper opens with a description of the devastating plague that afflicted Florence in 1348. The plague, characterized by plague-boils and black blotches, killed rapidly and was highly contagious, spreading through contact with the sick or their belongings. Society broke down: laws dissolved, families abandoned their sick, and traditional burial rites were replaced by mass graves. People adopted various behaviors, from strict seclusion to unrestrained revelry, all trying to escape or cope with the omnipresent death. The author estimates over a hundred thousand perished in Florence.

Amidst this calamity, seven young ladies – Pampinea, Fiammetta, Filomena, Emilia, Lauretta, Neifile, and Elisa – gather in the venerable church of Santa Maria Novella. Pampinea proposes they retreat to a country estate to escape the horrors and live agreeably. Filomena, while agreeing, wisely suggests that a company of women alone would be disorderly and susceptible to scandal, and that they need the guidance of men. Three young men – Pamfilo, Filostrato, and Dioneo – who are also seeking solace and whose mistresses are among the ladies, enter the church. Pampinea, related to one of them, invites them to join, promising a ""pure and brotherly spirit."" The young men joyfully accept.

The next morning, the company, with their servants, leaves Florence for a beautiful palace on a hill. Dioneo, the merriest, insists they live merrily, having left their cares in the city. Pampinea, elected the first queen, establishes rules: a new chief will be chosen daily to maintain order, and the household duties are assigned to the servants. After enjoying the gardens, they dine and entertain themselves with music and dancing. In the afternoon, the queen proposes storytelling as a pleasant way to pass the hot hours. All agree, and Pampinea decrees that for the first day, each may tell any story they like. Pamfilo is asked to begin.

**Pamfilo's Story (First Day, First Story): Master Ciappelletto**
Pamfilo recounts the tale of Master Ciappelletto da Prato, an infamously wicked scrivener known for forgery, false witness, violence, and blasphemy. He is hired by Musciatto Franzesi, a Florentine merchant, to deal with litigious Burgundian debtors. Ciappelletto falls ill at the house of two Florentine usurers. The brothers fear that if he dies unconfessed, his body will be disgraced, leading to public unrest against them. Ciappelletto, overhearing their fears, resolves to resolve the situation by committing one last, great deception. He requests a holy friar for confession. In a masterful performance, Ciappelletto invents a life of extreme piety, virginity, charity, and righteous anger, confessing only minor ""sins"" like drinking water too eagerly or cursing his mother as a child (for which he weeps profusely). The friar, completely deceived, believes him a saint. Ciappelletto dies. The friar proclaims his sanctity, and he is buried with great honor, becoming ""Saint Ciappelletto,"" to whom miracles are attributed. Pamfilo concludes that God, in His benignity, hears the prayers of the faithful, regardless of the intercessor's true character.

**Neifile's Story (First Day, Second Story): Abraham the Jew**
Neifile tells of Jehannot de Chevigné, a devout Parisian merchant, who tries to convert his Jewish friend, Abraham, to Christianity. Abraham agrees to consider it, but only after visiting Rome to observe the Pope and clergy. Jehannot is distraught, fearing the notorious corruption of the Roman court will deter Abraham. However, upon returning from Rome, Abraham declares his intention to convert. He explains that, despite witnessing extreme lust, avarice, and gluttony among the clergy, he concludes that a religion that not only survives but flourishes under such leadership must truly be sustained by the Holy Spirit. He is baptized Giovanni and lives a devout life.

**Filomena's Story (First Day, Third Story): Melchizedek the Jew**
Filomena relates how Saladin, the Soldan of Babylon, in urgent need of money, plots to extort it from the rich but miserly Jew, Melchizedek. Saladin asks Melchizedek which of the three religions (Jewish, Saracen, or Christian) is the true one, hoping to trap him. Melchizedek, perceiving the snare, replies with the story of a father who had a precious ring to designate his heir. Having three equally beloved sons, he secretly had two identical rings made and gave one to each. Upon his death, all three sons produced their rings, but the true one could not be distinguished, so the question of the true heir remained pending. Melchizedek concludes that similarly, each religion believes itself to have the true law, but the question remains undecided. Saladin, impressed by his wisdom, reveals his financial need. Melchizedek freely lends him the money. Saladin repays him, gives him gifts, and keeps him as a trusted friend.

**Dioneo's Story (First Day, Fourth Story): A Monk and His Abbot**
Dioneo tells of a lusty young monk in a monastery in Lunigiana who brings a peasant girl to his cell. The abbot discovers them and waits to catch the monk.

The abbot, intending to catch the monk red-handed, takes the key, enters the cell, and is himself overcome by lust for the beautiful girl. He engages in intimacy with her. The monk, observing all this, is pardoned by the ashamed abbot, who realizes his own hypocrisy. The girl is released.

The Marchioness, discerning his intent, orders her cooks to prepare only hen dishes. At dinner, the King questions the lack of other fowl. The Marchioness replies that women, like hens, are all ""of the same fashion"" (implying she is without her ""cock"" / husband), subtly rebuking his intentions. The King, recognizing her wit and discretion, abandons his pursuit and departs.

**Emilia's Story (First Day, Sixth Story): An Honest Man and a Friar Inquisitor**
Emilia tells of a greedy Friar Inquisitor in Florence who, hearing a rich simple man jokingly claim to have wine Christ might drink, falsely accuses him of blasphemy to extort money. The man, terrified, pays a large bribe. As penance, he must attend mass daily. One day, he hears the Gospel promise of a hundredfold return for good deeds. He tells the inquisitor he pities the friars because they give so much leftover broth to the poor; if they get a hundredfold return, they will drown in it in the afterlife. The angry inquisitor dismisses him.

**Filostrato's Story (First Day, Seventh Story): Bergamino and Messer Cane della Scala**
Filostrato recounts how Messer Cane della Scala, a magnificent but suddenly parsimonious nobleman, dismisses all his entertainers except Bergamino, a witty man, without paying or dismissing him. Bergamino, running out of money, sells his fine clothes. When Messer Cane mockingly asks him what ails him, Bergamino tells a story of Primasso, a scholar, who visited the generous Abbot of Cluny. The Abbot, for the first time, was stingy when he saw Primasso, who, having brought his own bread, ate it. The Abbot then realized his folly and generously rewarded Primasso.

The King, shamed by her poignant request, awakens to his duties, cruelly avenges her wrong, and becomes a valorous prosecutor of crime.

**Queen Pampinea's Story (First Day, Tenth Story): Master Alberto of Bologna**
Queen Pampinea relates how Master Alberto, an old but famous Bolognese physician, falls in love with the beautiful widow, Madam Malgherida. She and her friends mock him for his age. When they playfully ask him why he loves her, he replies that old men, with more experience, better appreciate beauty. He compares young suitors to eating the bad leaves of a leek while he, the old man, desires the good ""head"" (implying she might choose him over younger, less substantial men). The ladies are abashed, and the lady promises to be his ""creature,"" respecting his love while preserving her honor.

After the stories, Pampinea appoints Filomena as the next queen. Filomena sets the theme for Day Two: ""OF THOSE WHO AFTER BEING BAFFLED BY DIVERS CHANCES HAVE WON AT LAST TO A JOYFUL ISSUE BEYOND THEIR HOPE.""

A Florentine recognizes him and exposes the trick. The enraged crowd beats Martellino severely. To save him, Marchese falsely accuses Martellino of being a cutpurse. The Provost's sergeants rescue him from the mob, but the judge tortures him. Martellino cleverly exposes the false accusations by pointing out inconsistencies in the accusers' timelines.

The friar, believing her, sternly rebukes the gentleman, who immediately understands the lady's clever device. He begins to visit her, under the guise of being ""chastised."" Later, the lady ""complains"" again to the friar that the gentleman has sent her gifts. The friar, again deceived, takes the gifts and returns them to the gentleman, unknowingly facilitating their communication and intimacy. Finally, the lady tells the friar that the gentleman tried to enter her room via the garden window.

Fra Puccio, believing her to be suffering from hunger due to her fasting, urges her to rest. The monk and lady continue their affair discreetly until the penance ends.

Messer Francesco agrees, intending to outwit him, and instructs Caterina not to speak a word. Il Zima delivers a passionate declaration of love. Caterina remains silent, but her sighs and glances betray her awakened feelings. Il Zima, realizing the husband's trick, cunningly replies to himself, as if Caterina is speaking, promising to yield to his love after her husband departs for Milan in a few days. He tells himself to look for two napkins displayed in her window as a signal. Messer Francesco, believing Caterina to be a ""marble statue,"" claims the horse. A few days later, he leaves for Milan.

Later, Messer Geri holds a banquet and sends a servant with a large flagon to Cisti for wine.

He wagers a supper on it. His friend, Neri Mannini, accepts. Scalza ""proves"" his point by arguing that God created the Cadgers when he was first learning to draw (explaining their distorted faces), and all other men after He learned.

**Filostrato's Story (Sixth Day, Seventh Story): Madam Filippa**

She then asks her husband if he has always taken his pleasure of her whenever he wished. He admits she has. Filippa then asks the provost what she should do with the ""rest"" of her body and desires, implying it's better to gratify a lover than let it go to waste. The crowd, amused, agrees. The statute is modified to apply only to women who sell their favors for money. Filippa returns home in triumph.

**Queen Elisa's Story (Sixth Day, Ninth Story): Guido Cavalcanti**
Queen Elisa recounts how Florentine gentlemen, including Messer Betto Brunelleschi, try to engage Guido Cavalcanti, a renowned logician and philosopher, in their merry company. Guido, often lost in thought (and suspected of Epicurean views, i.e., doubting God's existence), rejects them. One day, Messer Betto and his company, riding past the tombs outside San Giovanni, accost Guido, who is deep in thought among them. They mock him, saying, ""Guido, thou refusest to be of our company; but, harkye, whenas thou shalt have found that God is not, what wilt thou have accomplished?"" Guido, hemmed in, leaps nimbly over a tomb and replies, ""Gentlemen, you may say what you will to me in your own house."" He escapes. The gentlemen are initially confused, but Messer Betto interprets Guido's retort: the tombs are the ""houses of the dead,"" and by saying they are in ""their own house,"" Guido implied that they, being ignorant and unlettered compared to him, are ""worse than dead folk."" They are shamed and leave him alone.

**Dioneo's Story (Sixth Day, Tenth Story): Fra Cipolla**
Dioneo tells of Fra Cipolla, a friar of St. Anthony, known for his witty sermons and collecting alms. He promises the simple country folk of Certaldo that he will show them a feather of the Angel Gabriel (which he claims remained in the Virgin Mary's chamber). Two roguish youths, Giovanni and Biagio, decide to play a trick on him. While Fra Cipolla is at dinner, they bribe his slovenly servant, Guccio, and steal the feather from his saddle-bags, replacing it with coals. After dinner, Fra Cipolla begins his sermon, praising the Angel Gabriel. When he opens the casket, he finds coals. Without missing a beat, he improvises a new story: he claims he carries two relics, the Angel Gabriel's feather and coals from St. Lawrence's gridiron, which are so similar he accidentally brought the wrong one. He then proclaims that these coals are a more appropriate relic for the upcoming Feast of St. Lawrence, and that whoever is marked with them will be protected from fire.

Realizing he's been duped, Salabaetto seeks advice from a friend, Pietro dello Canigiano, in Naples. Canigiano devises a counter-trick. Salabaetto returns to Palermo with bales filled with tow (instead of goods) and casks filled with seawater (instead of oil), declaring them valuable merchandise awaiting other shipments.

The Divine Comedy-Dante Alighieri,"The provided text, ""The Divine Comedy: The Vision of Hell, Purgatory, and Paradise,"" details a journey undertaken by the narrator, guided by various figures, through the three realms of the afterlife.

**HELL (OR THE INFERNO)**

**Canto I:** The narrator finds himself lost in a ""gloomy wood"" after straying from the ""path direct."" He experiences terror and dismay. Upon reaching the foot of a mountain, he sees its shoulders already bathed in sunlight, offering a brief respite from his fear. As he attempts to ascend, he is confronted by three beasts: a nimble, speckled panther that checks his progress, a hunger-mad lion that fills the air with fear, and a lean she-wolf that overwhelms him with terror, causing him to lose all hope of ascending and driving him back down. While retreating, he discerns the form of a spirit whose voice seems faint. The narrator cries for mercy. The spirit reveals he was once a man, born in Mantua, a bard who sang of ""Anchises’ upright son"" (Aeneas). The narrator recognizes him as Virgil and expresses his immense love for Virgil's volume and style, begging for salvation from the she-wolf. Virgil explains that the beast allows none to pass and is insatiable. He prophesies the coming of a ""greyhound"" who will destroy her, one who lives by ""love, Wisdom, and virtue,"" whose land is ""’twixt either Feltro,"" and who will bring safety to Italia. Virgil offers to guide the narrator another way, through an ""eternal space"" where he will hear despairing shrieks from tormented ""Spirits of old"" and see those ""Content in fire"" who hope for blessedness. He warns that a worthier spirit must lead the narrator higher, as he, a rebel to God's law, cannot enter God's city. The narrator, wishing to escape evil and view ""Saint Peter’s gate,"" agrees to follow Virgil.

**Canto II:** As day departs, the narrator prepares for the perilous journey. He expresses doubt about his own virtue and worthiness, comparing himself unfavorably to Aeneas and Paul, who journeyed to the afterlife. He fears his enterprise will end in folly. Virgil, perceiving his ""vile fear,"" explains his presence. He was among those ""suspended"" (in Limbo) when a ""dame, so blest And lovely"" named Beatrice called him. Her eyes were brighter than the sun. She told Virgil that her friend (the narrator), not of her fortune but herself, met great hindrance through fear. She feared he was lost and asked Virgil to assist him with his eloquent tongue, promising to praise Virgil before her Master. The narrator expresses delight in obeying Beatrice, who he says is from a place revisited with joy by Love. He asks why she, who burns to return to ample space, would descend to ""this centre here beneath."" Beatrice explains she fears only things from which evil may proceed. She is divinely framed so that misery and fierce fire do not touch her. She also reveals that a ""blessed dame"" in high heaven (implied to be the Virgin Mary) grieves for the narrator's hindrance, inclining God's judgment to her will. This dame called Lucia, who then came to Beatrice, seated with Rachel, and urged Beatrice to succor the narrator, who loved her so much. Beatrice then hastened to Virgil, trusting in his pure eloquence. Virgil concludes his explanation, reassuring the narrator that three blessed maids plan his safety. The narrator's courage is restored, and he affirms his resumed purpose, ready to follow Virgil as his ""guide, master, and lord."" They enter the ""deep and woody way.""

**Canto III:** They arrive at a portal bearing a dim inscription: ""Through me you pass into the city of woe: Through me you pass into eternal pain: Through me among the people lost for aye. Justice the founder of my fabric mov’d: To rear me was the task of power divine, Supremest wisdom, and primeval love. Before me things create were none, save things Eternal, and eternal I endure. All hope abandon ye who enter here."" The narrator finds these words' meaning hard, but Virgil explains they are entering where souls ""doomed to misery"" have lost ""intellectual good."" Virgil takes his hand, and they enter. They hear sighs, lamentations, and loud moans from ""various tongues,"" making a tumult like sand in a whirlwind. The narrator asks who these souls are. Virgil explains they are the ""wretched souls of those, who liv’d Without or praise or blame,"" mixed with ""ill band Of angels"" who were neither rebellious nor true to God. Heaven drove them out to maintain its lustre, and Hell refuses them to prevent them from glorying. These souls have no hope of death, and their blind life is so mean they envy all other lots. Fame, mercy, and justice scorn them. Virgil tells the narrator to look and pass them by. The narrator sees a whirling flag, followed by a long train of spirits, including one who ""to base fear Yielding, abjur’d his high estate"" (Pope Celestine V, implied). These wretched souls, who ""ne’er lived,"" are naked, stung by wasps and hornets, their blood and tears dropping to their feet, gathered by worms. Looking further, the narrator sees a throng on the shore of a great stream. He asks Virgil who they are and why they are eager to cross. Virgil says he will know at the ""woeful tide of Acheron."" The narrator remains silent, ashamed. An old man, Charon, approaches in a bark, crying ""Woe to you wicked spirits! hope not Ever to see the sky again."" He says he comes to take them to eternal darkness, fierce heat, and ice. He tells the narrator, a ""live spirit,"" to leave. When the narrator doesn't move, Charon says he must come by another way, a nimbler boat. Virgil silences Charon, saying, ""Charon! thyself torment not: so ’t is will’d, Where will and power are one: ask thou no more."" Charon, with ""eyes of burning coal,"" falls silent. The spirits change color and gnash their teeth, blaspheming God, their parents, mankind, the place, time, and their birth. Charon beckons them, striking those who linger with his oar. Like autumn leaves, they cast themselves one by one into the boat. Virgil explains that those who die subject to God's wrath come from every clime, eager to cross, as heaven's justice goads them. No good spirit has ever passed here. Charon's complaint about the narrator's presence means he is not among the damned. The region then trembles violently, a blast of sad earth shoots forth a vermilion flame, and the narrator drops, ""as one with sudden slumber seiz’d.""

**Canto IV:** The narrator's deep slumber is broken by a crash of thunder. He awakens on the brink of a lamentable, dark, deep abyss, filled with innumerable plaints, its bottom obscured by clouds. Virgil, pale, proposes they descend, with him leading. The narrator, seeing Virgil's paleness, asks how he can proceed if his guide yields to dread. Virgil explains his paleness is from pity for the souls below, not fear. They enter the first circle, hearing only sighs, not tortures. These multitudes of men, women, and infants are blameless but unbaptized, having lived before the Gospel or not served God aright. They are lost, ""Only so far afflicted, that we live Desiring without hope."" The narrator is grieved, knowing many ""mighty worth"" are here. He asks if any have ever come forth from here to be blessed. Virgil, understanding, replies that he was new to this state when ""a puissant one"" (Christ, implied) arrived, crowned with victory, and drew forth the shades of Adam, Abel, Noah, Moses, Abraham, David, Israel, his sire and sons, and Rachel, exalting them to bliss. Before these, no human spirit was saved. They continue through the ""wood"" of spirits. They see a flame illuminating the darkened hemisphere. Approaching, the narrator discerns a ""tribe in honour high."" He asks who they are. Virgil says their renown in the upper world acquires favor in heaven. A voice cries, ""Honour the bard Sublime! his shade returns that left us late!"" Four mighty spirits approach, neither sorrowful nor glad. Virgil identifies them: Homer (bearing a falchion), Flaccus (Horace), Naso (Ovid), and Lucan. They greet Virgil and include the narrator as the sixth in their learned band. They pass onward, speaking. They arrive at a magnificent castle, seven times walled and defended by a pleasant stream. They cross the stream and enter through seven gates into a mead of lively verdure. Here dwell majestic figures who speak seldom but sweetly. They retire to an open, bright, lofty place. The narrator sees great spirits: Electra, Hector, Aeneas, Caesar, Camilla, Penthesilea, King Latinus, Lavinia, Brutus, Lucretia, Marcia, Julia, Cornelia, the Soldan, and a ""master of the sapient throng"" (Aristotle) seated amidst philosophers like Socrates, Plato, Democritus, Diogenes, Heraclitus, Empedocles, Anaxagoras, Thales, Zeno, Dioscorides, Orpheus, Linus, Tully, Seneca, Euclid, Ptolemy, Hippocrates, Galenus, Avicen, and Averroes. Virgil then leads the narrator away from this serene air into a storm-vexed climate, to a part where no light shines.

**Canto V:** They descend to the second circle, a lesser space containing more grief. Minos stands, examining crimes and sentencing souls by encircling himself with his tail, according to the degrees beneath. Souls confess all. Minos questions the narrator, warning him. Virgil silences Minos, stating their passage is divinely willed. Rueful wailings are heard. The narrator enters a place where ""light was silent all."" A noise like a sea in tempest bellows. The ""stormy blast of hell"" drives spirits in restless fury, whirling and dashing them. Shrieks, lamentations, moans, and blasphemies are heard. The narrator understands these are ""carnal sinners"" swayed by lust. They are driven like starlings or cranes. Virgil identifies them: Semiramis (empress of many tongues, so shameless in luxury she legalized it to clear her blame), Dido (slew herself for love), Cleopatra, Helen, Achilles (fought to the end for love), Paris, and Tristan. He shows a thousand more. The narrator, overcome with pity for these ""dames and knights of antique days,"" wishes to speak to two spirits coming together. Virgil tells him to entreat them by the love that carries them. The narrator calls them, and they speed through the ill air. One spirit, Francesca da Rimini, addresses him, a ""gracious creature and benign."" She thanks him for pity. She says her birthplace is where the Po descends to the ocean. She explains, ""Love, that in gentle heart is quickly learnt, Entangled him by that fair form, from me Ta’en in such cruel sort, as grieves me still: Love, that denial takes from none belov’d, Caught me with pleasing him so passing well, That, as thou see’st, he yet deserts me not. Love brought us to one death: Caina waits The soul, who spilt our life."" The narrator looks down in grief. He asks Francesca by what and how love granted them their wishes. She replies there is ""no greater grief than to remember days Of joy, when mis’ry is at hand!"" But if he eagerly desires to know, she will tell, weeping. One day, they read of Lancelot being thrall'd by love. They were alone, their eyes drawn together, their cheeks pale. They fell at one point: when they read of the ""wished smile, rapturously kiss’d,"" he (Paolo, implied) kissed her lips. ""The book and writer both Were love’s purveyors. In its leaves that day We read no more."" As she speaks, the other spirit wails so sorely that the narrator, heartstruck, faints like a corpse.

**Canto VI:** The narrator revives, having drooped with pity. He sees new torments in the third circle: ceaseless, accursed, heavy, cold showers of large hail, discolored water, and sleet stream down, making the land stink. Cerberus, a cruel, fierce, strange monster, barks through his threefold throat, with crimson eyes, black unctuous beard, large belly, and clawed hands, tearing the spirits. The spirits howl, screening themselves from the deluge. Cerberus sees them, opens his jaws. Virgil fills his palms with earth and casts it into the monster's maw, silencing him like a dog with a morsel. They pass over the prostrate shades. One spirit, Ciacco, sits up, asking the narrator if he recognizes him from before his body was broken. The narrator doesn't recognize him due to his anguish. Ciacco identifies himself as being from the narrator's city, ""heap’d with envy to the brim,"" and named Ciacco. He is tormented for gluttony, like all others here. The narrator expresses grief and asks Ciacco about the future of his ""divided city,"" if any just ones remain, and the cause of discord. Ciacco prophesies that after long striving, they will come to blood, and the ""wild party from the woods"" will chase the other. Within ""three solar circles,"" the wild party will fall, and the other will rise by ""borrow’d force of one, who under shore Now rests."" This party will oppress the other for a long time. He states there are only ""two just"" men, but they are neglected. Avarice, envy, pride are ""three fatal sparks."" The narrator asks about other worthy men like Farinata, Tegghiaio, Giacopo, Arrigo, Mosca. Ciacco replies, ""These are yet blacker spirits. Various crimes Have sunk them deeper in the dark abyss."" He asks the narrator to make mention of him when he returns to the ""pleasant world,"" then falls back down. Virgil explains that Ciacco will not leave his bed until the last angel-trumpet, when adverse power comes in glory, and each soul resumes its fleshly vesture to hear eternal doom. The narrator asks if the tortures will increase or be mitigated after the great sentence. Virgil says that as things grow to more perfection, they feel good and pain more sensibly. Though these accursed souls will never reach true perfection, they will approach it more nearly then. They continue on a circuitous path until they reach where the steps lead below, finding Plutus.

**Canto VII:** Plutus exclaims, ""Ah me! O Satan! Satan!"" Virgil reassures the narrator, saying Plutus has no power to hinder their descent. Virgil then silences Plutus, commanding him to let his fury consume himself, as they pass with divine will. Plutus drops to the ground like a collapsed sail. They descend to the fourth steep ledge, a ""dismal shore"" enclosing all the universe's woe. The narrator laments Almighty Justice. He sees a ""wretched race"" (more numerous than elsewhere) like clashing waves, rolling weights with their breasts, then smiting together and rolling back, shouting, ""Why holdest thou so fast?"" and ""And why castest thou away?"" The narrator asks what race this is, particularly those with shorn heads on their left. Virgil replies these are the avaricious and prodigal, who in life made no due use of their wealth. Those ""separate to the church"" (Popes and Cardinals) are also among them, crowned ""with no hairy cowls."" The narrator asks if he will recognize any. Virgil says their ""ignoble life"" makes them dark and indiscernible. They will forever meet in this shock, one rising with clenched grasp, the other with close-shaven locks. Their ill-giving and ill-keeping deprived them of the beautiful world. Virgil explains ""fortune's hands"" control fleeting goods, for which humanity strives, yet all the world's gold cannot purchase rest for one of these. The narrator asks Virgil what this ""fortune"" is. Virgil explains that God, with transcendent wisdom, ordained ruling powers for the heavens and a ""general minister"" (Fortune) to rule the world's images, changing life's empty advantages from race to race. Fortune plans, judges, and reigns by necessity, moving swiftly because many claim her favors. She is execrated but blessed, rolling her sphere in bliss. They must now descend to ""heavier woe,"" as the stars indicate time for leaving. They cross to the next steep, arriving at a well that pours itself down to a foss. The water is murkier than ""sablest grain."" They enter beneath, by a different track, into the Stygian lake. The narrator sees a ""miry tribe,"" naked and enraged, striking each other with hands, heads, breasts, feet, and fangs. Virgil explains these are the wrathful. He adds that a multitude dwells underneath the water, their sighs making the surface heave. Fixed in the slime, they say, ""Sad once were we In the sweet air... Now in these murky settlings are we sad,"" gurgling this dolorous strain without distinct words. They proceed along the segment between the dry embankment and the pool, until they reach a tower's base.

**Canto VIII:** The narrator recounts that before reaching the tower, they saw two cressets (beacons) hanging, and another distant light returning the signal. He asks Virgil what this means. Virgil replies they will soon see what awaits them on the ""filthy waters."" A small bark, ferried by one man, swiftly approaches. The ferryman, Phlegyas, cries, ""Art thou arriv’d, fell spirit?"" Virgil replies, ""Phlegyas, Phlegyas, This time thou criest in vain... No longer shalt thou have us, but while o’er The slimy pool we pass."" Phlegyas pines in fierce ire. Virgil steps into the skiff, and the narrator follows, noting the vessel is now weighed down. As they cross the ""dead channel,"" a spirit covered in mire asks, ""Who art thou, that thou comest ere thine hour?"" The narrator replies he doesn't tarry and asks who the spirit is. The spirit says, ""One, as thou seest, who mourn."" The narrator recognizes him as Filippo Argenti and tells him to remain in mourning. Argenti stretches his hands to the bark, but Virgil thrusts him back, ""Away! down there, To the other dogs!"" Virgil then embraces the narrator, praising his just disdain, and notes Argenti's arrogance in life. The narrator wishes to see Argenti whelmed in the dregs. Virgil replies his wish will be satisfied before they leave the lake. The miry tribes set on Argenti with violence. The narrator hears lamentation and sees the city of Dis drawing near, with minarets gleaming vermilion from eternal fire. They reach the deep fosses. The iron walls appear. They reach a place where Phlegyas cries, ""Go forth! The entrance is here!"" The narrator sees over a thousand fallen angels on the gates, who demand, ""Who is this... that without death first felt, goes through The regions of the dead?"" Virgil tries to parley. The demons' scorn abates, and they tell Virgil to come alone, but the narrator must return alone. The narrator is terrified, thinking he will never return. He implores Virgil not to desert him. Virgil reassures him, saying no one can disappoint their passage, which is divinely permitted. He tells the narrator to wait and comfort himself with hope, promising not to leave him. Virgil departs. The narrator remains, hesitating. He can't hear their terms, but the demons confer briefly, then flee within, closing the gates on Virgil. Virgil returns with tardy steps, eyes bent to the ground, confidence erased. He sighs, ""Who hath denied me these abodes of woe?"" He tells the narrator not to fear his anger, saying he will vanquish them. He says their insolence is not new, displayed at a less secret gate (Hell's main gate), which is still without bolt. He concludes that ""one whose strong might can open us this land"" is coming.

**Canto IX:** The narrator's pale cheeks reflect fear, which Virgil's face loses. Virgil listens attentively through the dark air and thick cloud. He states, ""It yet behooves We win this fight... Oh, how long Me seems it, ere the promis'd help arrive!"" The narrator notes Virgil's cloaked words. He asks if anyone from Limbo (first degree, pain is only deprivation of hope) ever descends to this depth. Virgil replies rarely, but he once came, conjured by the sorceress Erictho, to draw a spirit from Judas's circle (the lowest place). He knows the road well. He states the ""noisome stench"" of the lake surrounds the ""city of grief,"" which they cannot enter without rage. The narrator's attention is drawn to the lofty tower, where he sees three hellish furies, stained with blood, with green hydras and adders for hair. Virgil identifies them as Megaera, Alecto, and Tisiphone. They claw and smote themselves, raising a shrill clamour. The furies cry out to hasten Medusa to change the narrator to adamant. Virgil turns the narrator around and covers his eyes, warning him that viewing the Gorgon would mean losing his return upwards forever. A loud-crashing, terrible sound, like an impetuous wind, makes both shores tremble. Virgil loosens the narrator's eyes and tells him to look along the foam where smoke ascends. Like frogs fleeing a serpent, more than a thousand spirits flee before one who crosses the Stygian sound with unwet feet. This figure removes the gross air from his face and stretches forth his left hand, weary only from that annoyance. The narrator perceives he is sent from heaven. Virgil signals for silence and deference. The figure comes to the gate, touches it with his wand, and it flies open. Standing on the threshold, he rebukes the ""Outcasts of heav'n"" for their insolence and resistance to divine will, reminding them of Cerberus's past punishment. He then turns back without speaking to them. They move toward the territory, secure after the ""hallow'd words,"" and enter unopposed. The narrator looks around and sees a wide space replete with pain and torment. Like the plain of Arles or Pola, the place is thick with sepulchres, but here with scattered flames burning intensely, hotter than iron for any craft. Their lids hang suspended, and lamentable moans issue forth. The narrator asks who is interred here. Virgil replies, ""The arch-heretics are here, accompanied By every sect their followers; and much more, Than thou believest, tombs are freighted: like With like is buried; and the monuments Are different in degrees of heat."" They turn to the right, passing between the afflicted and the ramparts.

**Canto X:** They proceed along a secret pathway between the walls and the tormented souls. The narrator asks if those in the sepulchres can be seen, as their lids are raised. Virgil explains they will be closed when the souls return from Josaphat with their bodies. He identifies the Epicureans here, who believe the spirit dies with the body. He says satisfaction will be given to the narrator's question and hidden wish. The narrator says he hides nothing from his guide, but avoids vain words. A voice from a vault addresses the narrator, recognizing him as a Tuscan, and saying he dealt severely with that noble land. The narrator approaches Virgil. Virgil tells him to turn and see Farinata, who has uplifted himself from the waist up. The narrator's gaze is fixed on Farinata, who seems to scorn hell itself. Virgil pushes the narrator to the tomb's foot, warning him to speak clearly. Farinata eyes him, then asks about his ancestors. The narrator reveals them. Farinata, uplifting his brow, says they were fiercely adverse to him and his party, and he scattered them twice. The narrator retorts that his kin returned each time, an art Farinata's have not learned. Then, from Farinata's side, another shade, Cavalcante de' Cavalcanti, rises to the chin, looking for someone with the narrator. Perceiving his hope quenched, he weeps, asking about his son, Guido. The narrator replies he did not come of himself, but guided by Virgil, whom ""Guido thy son Had in contempt."" Cavalcante, misinterpreting the past tense, exclaims, ""How! said’st thou he HAD? No longer lives he?"" and falls supine, not appearing again. Farinata, great of soul, remains stern. He continues their previous discourse, lamenting that his kin have shown small skill in the art of returning, which torments him more than his bed. He prophesies that the narrator will know the full weight of that art within ""not yet fifty times"" the Queen of this realm is relumed. He asks why Florence is so fell against his kin. The narrator attributes it to the ""slaughter and great havoc"" that stained Arbia's flood crimson. Farinata sighs, then states he stood alone against the consent of all to raze Florence. The narrator implores him to solve the knot: how the damned seem to view the future but are uninformed of the present. Farinata answers they see ""objects far remote"" plainly, but when they approach or exist, their intellect fails, knowing nothing of the human state except what others bring them. Their knowledge will expire when ""futurity the portals close."" The narrator, conscious of his fault, asks Farinata to tell Cavalcante that his offspring still lives, and his silence was due to his thoughts being intent on the error Virgil has solved. Virgil summons the narrator. The narrator asks Farinata who else partakes his lot. Farinata names Frederick II and ""the Lord Cardinal"" and then withdraws. The narrator ruminates on the words importing harm. Virgil asks about his amazement and enjoins him to store what he heard, adding that Beatrice will unfold his future when he stands before her. They turn left, leave the wall, and proceed by a path to a valley exhaling noisome steam.

**Canto XI:** They reach the edge of a high bank, where crueler woes are stored. To avoid the foul exhalation, they stand behind a monument inscribed, ""I have in charge Pope Anastasius, whom Photinus drew From the right path."" Virgil explains they must delay to accustom their senses. The narrator asks for a compensation for the lost time. Virgil begins to describe the lower hell's structure: three circles within these rocks, for the violent. Injury is the end of all malicious acts, either by force or fraud. Fraud is more displeasing to God. The violent occupy the first circle, divided into three rounds for those who harm God, neighbor, or self. Violence to neighbor includes death, wounds, devastation, plunder, flames (slayers, smiters, plunderers, robbers). Violence to self and possessions means depriving oneself of life, wasting talent (suicides, prodigals). Violence to God means denying and blaspheming his power, contemning nature (blasphemers, sodomites, usurers). Fraud can be against one who trusts (breaking special faith) or one who withholds strict confidence (breaking natural love). The second circle (of fraud) includes dissimulation, witchcraft, flatteries, theft, falsehood, simony, seduction, pimping. The ""lesser circle"" (lowest) is for the traitor, in the dreadful seat of Dis. The narrator asks why the incontinent (from earlier circles, beaten by rain, driven by tempest, conflicting with tongues) are not punished in the ""city fire-illum'd"" (Dis), if God's wrath is on them. Virgil says his mind wanders, reminding him of his ""ethic page"" (Aristotle) describing three dispositions adverse to Heaven: incontinence, malice, and brutishness. Incontinence offends God least. This explains why they are apart from the ""fell spirits"" in Dis. The narrator, satisfied, asks Virgil to explain why usury offends ""celestial Goodness."" Virgil replies that philosophy and nature imitate the celestial mind and its art. Human art follows nature. Both are the source of life and excellence. But the usurer walks another path, setting nature and her follower (art) at naught. Virgil urges them to follow him, as the ""Pisces play"" and the ""Wain lies all O’er the north-west,"" indicating the time to move down the rocky height.

**Canto XII:** They reach a rough, Alp-like precipice. At its verge lies the Minotaur, the ""infamy of Crete,"" gnawing itself in rage. Virgil addresses it, saying they are not Theseus but are there to see torments. The Minotaur plunges like a struck bull. They descend through dilapidated crags. The narrator ponders the ruin. Virgil explains that when he first descended to nether hell, this rock had not fallen, but it fell during the earthquake caused by ""He"" (Christ, implied) who carried off spoils from the highest circle. Virgil then points out the approaching ""river of blood,"" where all who have injured by violence are steeped. He laments blind lust and foolish wrath. He sees an ample foss, bent like a bow, circled by centaurs armed with arrows. Three centaurs approach, one (Nessus) asking their purpose. Virgil tells him they will speak to Chiron. Virgil identifies Nessus (who died for Deianira), Chiron (Achilles' nurturer), and Pholus. These centaurs shoot at spirits emerging from the blood. They near the beasts. Chiron draws an arrow, pushes his beard back, and exclaims to his fellows, ""Are ye aware, that he who comes behind Moves what he touches? The feet of the dead Are not so wont."" Virgil, standing near Chiron, explains the narrator is alive, guided by necessity and a heavenly dame, not a robber. He asks for one of the centaurs to guide them to the ford and convey the narrator, mounted on his back, as he cannot walk air. Chiron assigns Nessus. They move along the ""crimson-seething flood,"" hearing shrieks. Nessus points out tyrants immersed up to their brows: Alexander, Dionysius. He identifies Azzolino and Obizzo d'Este. He then points to a spirit immersed up to its throat, saying, ""He in God’s bosom smote the heart, Which yet is honour’d on the bank of Thames"" (Guy de Montfort, implied). They see another race immersed up to the bust. The blood becomes shallower, imbruing only the feet. Nessus explains the river depth varies. He names Attila, Sextus, Pyrrhus, Rinieri da Corneto, and Pazzo as those punished deeper. Nessus then turns back alone.

**Canto XIII:** Before Nessus reaches the other bank, they enter a forest with dusky foliage, gnarled and thick boughs, and thorns instead of fruits. Harpies nest here. Virgil explains this is the second round, where suicides are punished. He tells the narrator to look. The narrator hears sad plainings but sees no one. Virgil, assuming the narrator thinks voices come from hiding spirits, tells him to lop off a twig. The narrator plucks a branch, and the trunk cries, ""Why pluck’st thou me?"" Dark blood trickles, and the trunk adds, ""Wherefore tear’st me thus? Is there no touch of mercy in thy breast? Men once were we, that now are rooted here."" Words and blood burst from the splinter. The narrator drops the bough, terrified. Virgil apologizes, explaining the narrator's disbelief. He asks the spirit who he was, promising to revive his fame in the upper world. The trunk, swayed by the ""pleasant word,"" cannot refrain from speech. It identifies itself as one who held ""both keys to Frederick’s heart,"" a faithful servant. It says ""the harlot"" (envy) inflamed minds against him, leading to his disgrace. His soul, disdainful, sought refuge in death, becoming ""unjust toward myself"" (suicide). He swears he never broke faith with his lord and asks for his memory to be cleared. Virgil tells the narrator to ask more. The narrator, feeling pity, cannot. Virgil then asks the spirit how the soul is tied in these joints and if any are ever loosened. The trunk replies that when the ""fierce soul"" tears itself from the body, Minos dooms it to the seventh gulf, where it falls into the wood and sprouts as a savage plant. Harpies feed on its leaves, causing pain and grief. At the Last Judgment, they will come for their ""spoils"" (bodies) but will not be re-clad, as it is not just to have what one took from oneself. Their bodies will be hung on their thorny shades. While listening, they hear a noise like a wild boar hunt. Two naked spirits, torn by briers, flee headlong, breaking the wood. One cries, ""Haste now, death!"" The other, Lano, falls into a bush. Black female mastiffs pursue, tear him to pieces, and carry away his limbs. Virgil leads the narrator to the thicket. The bush cries, ""O Giacomo Of Sant’ Andrea! what avails it thee... For thy ill life what blame on me recoils?"" Virgil asks the bush who he was. He replies he lived in Florence, which changed its patron from the Baptist, causing woe. He confesses, ""I slung the fatal noose from my own roof.""

**Canto XIV:** The narrator collects the scattered leaves for the bush. They reach the boundary from the second to the third round, revealing a horrible contrivance of justice. They reach a wide plain of arid, thick sand. Many naked spirits weep, some supine, some seated, others pacing. Dilated flakes of fire fall slowly. The narrator asks about a huge spirit, Capaneus, who lies writhen in proud scorn, heedless of the burning. Capaneus defiantly states he is still as he was in life, challenging Jove and his lightnings. Virgil rebukes him, saying his pride is his punishment. Virgil then leads the narrator along the wood, warning him not to step on the hot sand. They reach a little brook whose crimson wave lifts the narrator's hair with horror. It runs through the sand, its banks and bottom stone-built. Virgil says this river is the most worthy of regard, as it quenches the flames. The narrator asks for more information. Virgil explains it originates from a huge, ancient form (the Old Man of Crete) on Mount Ida, whose head is gold, breast and arms silver, middle brass, lower part steel (except a clay right foot), all rent throughout. Tears distil from it, forming Acheron, Styx, and Phlegethon, which flow to Cocytus. The narrator asks why they only see it now. Virgil explains the circular nature of hell and their descent. The narrator asks about Phlegethon and Lethe. Virgil clarifies the red wave is Phlegethon, and Lethe will be seen in Purgatory. He urges them to quit the wood, as the margins provide safe passage from flames.

**Canto XV:** They walk on a solid margin, enveloped in a mist from the stream that saves them from fire. They meet a troop of spirits who eye them intently. One, Brunetto Latini, recognizes the narrator and asks to speak. The narrator agrees, asking if he can sit. Brunetto explains that any spirit stopping for an instant must lie for a hundred years in the fire. So they proceed, Brunetto walking at the narrator's garments. Brunetto asks how the narrator came there. The narrator explains he was lost in a valley, met Virgil, and is being led home. Brunetto prophesies a glorious haven for the narrator if he follows his star, but warns of enmity from the ""ungrateful and malignant race"" of Florence (from Fiesole). He advises the narrator to cleanse himself of their ways, as his fortune has such honor in reserve that he will be sought by both parties. The narrator replies that he desires to complete his journey, recalling Brunetto's teaching on winning eternity, and is prepared for fortune's wheel. Virgil smiles. The narrator asks about other known spirits. Brunetto says some are well-known, but most should be left unmentioned. He briefly mentions clerks polluted by the same sin, including Priscian and Francesco d'Accorso. He points out one transferred from Arno to Bacchiglione. Brunetto then says he must leave to rejoin his troop, as another company is approaching with whom he may not sort. He commends his ""TREASURE"" (his work) to the narrator. He then flees like a runner winning a prize.

**Canto XVI:** They reach a place where the water's din is loud. Three spirits emerge from a troop, running swiftly, asking the narrator to stay, recognizing his garb. The narrator notes their flame-inflicted wounds. Virgil tells him to wait, as they merit courtesy. The three spirits, circling, direct their faces at the narrator. One asks who he is, noting his living feet. He identifies himself as Guidoguerra, the next as Aldobrandi, and himself as Rusticucci, brought to this by his savage wife. The narrator says his grief, not scorn, is fixed deep within him. He identifies himself as a countryman. He says he is on a journey to the center of hell, guided by Virgil. Guidoguerra asks if courtesy and valor still dwell in Florence, as Borsiere (a spirit walking nearby) brings ill news. The narrator cries out that Florence's pride, sudden gains, and excess have led to its mournful state. The three look at each other, pleased by his truthfulness, and ask him to speak of them when he returns to the world. They then flee swiftly. Virgil and the narrator proceed. The water's sound grows louder, roaring down a precipice. Virgil asks for the cord around the narrator's girdle. The narrator unlooses it, and Virgil casts it into the abyss, watching intently. The narrator speculates this is a strange signal. Virgil explains he expects something and that the narrator's thoughts are dreaming of it. He swears he saw a monstrous shape swimming up through the murky air, like someone returning from loosing an anchor.

**Canto XVII:** Virgil identifies the monster as Geryon, a vile image of fraud with a deadly sting, who ""taints all the world."" Geryon appears with a just man's face, a serpent's body, shaggy claws, and a back and breast painted with nodes and orbits. His forked tail is armed with a scorpion's sting. Virgil instructs them to approach the beast. They turn right and walk ten paces along the verge to avoid flames. Virgil tells the narrator to observe a tribe of spirits seated on the sand near a chasm, but not to speak long, as he will parley with Geryon for passage. The narrator sees spirits with pangs gushing from their eyes, alternately shifting their hands against the vapors and torrid soil. Each bears a pouch around their neck with various colors and emblems. He sees a yellow purse with an azure lion, a red purse with a white goose. One spirit, bearing a white scrip with an azure swine, addresses the narrator, identifying himself as a Paduan and predicting his neighbor Vitaliano will sit on his left, and then a ""noble knight"" with a pouch with three beaks will arrive. He twists his mouth and lolls his tongue. The narrator returns to Virgil, who is already seated on Geryon's haunch. Virgil encourages him, telling him to mount in front while he stays in the middle. The narrator is fearful but mounts. Virgil embraces him and commands Geryon to move with ample gyres and an easy descent, mindful of the unusual burden. Geryon loosens from the rim, turns his forked tail, and steers like an eel. The narrator feels immense dread, seeing only the beast and the air. He hears the cataract below, sees flames, and hears wailings, realizing their downward course. Geryon descends like a falcon. He places them at the base of the deep-furrowed rock and shoots away like an arrow.

**Canto XVIII:** They are in Malebolge, a place of dark rock, forming ten trenches with a spacious gulf in the middle. Flinty paths (bridges) advance from the rock's base, crossing the trenches to the gulf. Virgil leads left. In the first chasm, they see naked sinners being scourged by horned demons with huge lashes. The narrator recognizes Venedico Caccianemico, who admits he led Ghisola to do the Marquis's will. A demon strikes him. They move to a rock where Virgil points out Jason, who won the ram from Colchos and beguiled Hypsipyle, leaving her pregnant. Medea's injuries are also avenged here. This is the first vale. They cross to the second chasm, hearing ghosts jibbering and snorting, immersed in ordure. The banks are encrusted with foul steam. The narrator sees Alessio Interminei of Lucca, who admits his flatteries sank him there. Virgil points out Thais, the harlot, who there ""doth rend her with defiled nails.""

**Canto XIX:** They are now in the third chasm. The narrator laments Simon Magus and his followers. He sees a livid stone with circular apertures, like baptismal fonts. From each mouth emerge a sinner's feet and legs up to the calf, the rest hidden below. The soles of their feet are burning, causing violent motion. The narrator asks who is suffering the fiercest agony. Virgil offers to carry him down. The narrator agrees. Virgil lowers him to an orifice where a spirit's limb quivers. The narrator addresses the spirit. The spirit shouts, mistaking the narrator for Pope Boniface VIII, accusing him of already surfeiting on ill-gotten wealth. The narrator is confused, and Virgil tells him to clarify he is not Boniface. The spirit then wrenches his feet and sighs, asking who the narrator is. He reveals he was a Pope, a son of a she-bear (Nicholas III, implied), eager to advance his ""whelps"" (nephews), and for this simony, his ""having in my purse"" and himself are here. He says other simoniac popes are dragged beneath him, and he will fall deeper when the one he mistook for Boniface arrives. He prophesies a ""shepherd without law"" from the west will arrive after him, covering both his form and the speaker's (Pope Clement V, implied, and Philip IV of France, implied, acting like a new Jason and priest). The narrator then scolds him for simony, recalling Peter's commission and the avarice that o'ercasts the world. He denounces the corruption of the church and blames Constantine's dower for its ills. The spirit, whether from wrath or conscience, violently springs up. Virgil is pleased. He lifts the narrator to his bosom and carries him up to the summit of the rock, a difficult path. Thence, another vale appears.

**Canto XX:** The narrator sees a tribe in the hollow vale, weeping in silence, their necks reversed so their faces are averted from their front, compelling them to walk backward. The narrator weeps, but Virgil chastises his pity, saying it should be for God's judgment. He points out Amphiaraus, who saw too far ahead, now looks backward. He points out Tiresias, who changed gender. Aruns follows. He then points out Manto, who settled in Virgil's native Mantua. Virgil recounts Mantua's origin, stressing that Manto chose the spot, which became a city on ""dead bones"" (not Manto's). He warns against other false origins of Mantua. The narrator asks about other notable spirits. Virgil points out Eurypilus, the seer from Aulis. Next, Michael Scot, practiced in magic. Guido Bonatti and Asdente (who repents of leaving his trade for divination). He shows other diviners. Virgil then notes the time, saying ""Cain with fork of thorns"" (the moon) is setting, and the moon served them well in the dark wood. They move on.

**Canto XXI:** They pass to the summit of another gap in Malebolge. The place is dark. A glutinous, thick pitch boils like tar in the Venetian arsenal. The narrator cannot distinguish anything but the surge. Virgil pulls him aside, warning him. A black devil runs along the rock, carrying a sinner on his shoulder, held by the haunches and foot's sinew. The devil shouts to other ""keen-talon'd fiends"" to throw the sinner (one of Santa Zita's elders, a ""barterer"" from Lucca) into the pitch. The fiends grapple the sinner with hooks, telling him to sport covered so he can ""filch in secret."" Virgil instructs the narrator to hide behind a rock while he deals with them, having been in similar situations. Virgil approaches the sixth pier. The demons rush out, pointing weapons. Virgil demands one come forth to hear his words before seizing him. Malacoda, the leader, advances. Virgil states he comes by divine will and destiny to lead someone through this wilderness. Malacoda's pride falls; he drops his torture instrument and declares they have no power to strike them. Virgil calls the narrator from his hiding place. The narrator fears the fiends might break the compact. The fiends question touching the narrator. Malacoda stops Scarmiglione and tells Virgil that the rock is shattered further along, so they must go up by a cavern, where another rock will provide safe passage. He adds that 1266 years plus five hours ago, the way was broken. He dispatches ten demons (Alichino, Calcabrina, Cagnazzo, Barbariccia (leader), Libicocco, Draghinazzo, Ciriatto, Graffiacane, Farfarello, Rubicant) to escort them, assuring them they are ""nothing fell."" The narrator expresses fear, seeing their gnarls and threats. Virgil tells him not to fear, as it is only spite against the tormented souls. The demons turn left, give an obscene signal, and move on.

**Canto XXII:** The narrator compares the demons' movements to various military maneuvers. He goes with the ten demons, a ""fearful company."" He gazes at the pitch, seeing sinners show their backs then hide, like dolphins. The sinners stand at the brink with only their jaws out, like frogs. When Barbariccia approaches, they retreat. One sinner, however, remains. Graffiacan grapples him by his clotted locks and drags him out, appearing like an otter. The demons shout to Rubicant to flay him. The narrator asks who this soul is. Virgil asks the sinner his origin. The sinner replies he was born in Navarre, served King Thibault, and turned to peculating, for which he is now in this heat. Ciriatto rips him with a tusk. Barbariccia stops them, tells them to inquire more before tearing him again. Virgil asks about his partners in guilt. The Navarrese replies he just parted from Friar Gomita of Gallura, a vessel of guile, who took money to release his master's enemies. He also mentions Michel Zanche. Libicocco seizes the Navarrese's arm with a prong. Draghinazzo goes for his thighs, but Barbariccia restrains them. The Navarrese then offers to call other Tuscan or Lombard spirits if they will ease their fury. He says he will make seven appear with a whistle. Cagnazzo grins, thinking it a trick to escape. The Navarrese insists it's only to procure more woe for himself. Alichino challenges him to cast himself down, saying he will fly to catch him. The demons turn to watch the other shore. The Navarrese leaps onto land and escapes their grasp. Alichino pursues him, but the sinner plunges into the pitch. Calcabrina, enraged, attacks Alichino. They grapple and fall into the boiling lake, their wings glued. Barbariccia dispatches four others to hook them out, and they leave the fiends in their quarrel.

**Canto XXIII:** They proceed in silence, like friars. The narrator reflects on Aesop's fable of the mouse and frog, fearing the demons' anger. He tells Virgil he sees them pursuing. Virgil says he anticipated his thoughts and has a plan: if the right coast inclines enough, they can descend to another chasm and escape. Before Virgil finishes, the narrator sees the demons approaching with spread wings. Virgil snatches him up like a mother saving her child from fire and casts himself down the jutting beach to a pendent rock. They descend rapidly. The demons reach the steep above them but cannot depart from the fifth foss. They see a ""painted tribe"" in the depth below, pacing slowly, weeping, faint and toiled. They wear caps with hoods, gilded outside but leaden within, making them heavy. They turn left with this group. The narrator asks Virgil to find a notable spirit. One spirit, understanding Tuscan, calls out, asking them to stop. Virgil tells the narrator to pause. Two spirits, eager but burdened, approach. They note the narrator is alive. They identify themselves as ""Joyous friars"" from Bologna, Catalano and Loderingo, who were once called to Florence as arbiters to reconcile strifes, but Gardingo's vicinage (where their treachery caused destruction) can best explain. The narrator is about to speak when he sees a spirit crucified on the ground with three stakes. Catalano identifies him as the one who advised the Pharisees that ""it were fitting for one man to suffer for the people"" (Caiaphas). He lies transverse, and everyone passes over him. His father-in-law and other council members are there. Virgil looks at Caiaphas in wonder. Virgil asks Catalano if there is an opening to the right to exit without involving the dark angels. Catalano replies that a shattered rock from the next circle provides a way, slanting down. Virgil realizes the demon Malacoda gave them false information. Catalano adds that the devil is a liar. Virgil, disturbed, proceeds with large strides. The narrator follows.

**Canto XXIV:** The narrator compares Virgil's troubled look and swift recovery to a peasant finding hope after a winter's store runs out. They reach the fallen bridge. Virgil takes him up, scaling peaks, telling him to test each crag. The narrator feels exhausted and sits down. Virgil tells him to rise, reminding him that fame is not won by ease, and urges him to overcome weariness, as a longer ladder remains. The narrator rises, claiming to be stout and fearless. They continue up a rougher, steeper path. A voice from the other foss (chasm) speaks, seemingly in anger. The narrator cannot make out the words due to darkness and asks Virgil to descend. Virgil replies he will answer by deed and leads them down. They descend to the eighth mound, where the chasm opens to reveal a crowd of terrible serpents. Naked spirits run in fear, their hands bound behind them by snakes, which twist their tails and heads before them. An adder pierces one spirit (Vanni Fucci) in the neck. He kindles, burns to ashes, then immediately re-forms, like a phoenix. Virgil asks who he is. Vanni Fucci replies he is Vanni Fucci, from Tuscany, who preferred a ""beastial life"" and found his den in Pistoia. The narrator tells Virgil to make him stay and ask his crime, as he knew him as choleric and bloody. Vanni Fucci, ashamed, admits he rifled the sacristy and falsely accused another. To spite the narrator, he prophesies future woes for Pistoia and Florence, involving a vapor from Valdimagra (Mars' wrath) that will strike down the Bianche party.

**Canto XXV:** When Vanni Fucci finishes speaking, he raises his hands in mockery, crying, ""Take them, God!"" Serpents immediately bind his neck and arms, silencing him. The narrator laments Pistoia. A centaur, Cacus, comes, with snakes swarming on his haunch and a fire-breathing dragon on his shoulders. Virgil identifies him as Cacus, who stole Hercules' cattle and was killed by him. Cacus speeds away. Three spirits appear below them, and one asks, ""Where doth Cianfa lurk?"" A six-footed serpent springs onto one spirit (Agnello), fastening to his belly, arms, and thighs, then intertwines. They melt into each other, mingling hues, losing their individual forms to become a single, miscreate image. The other two spirits exclaim at Agnello's transformation. Another adder, fiery and dark, appears and transpierces one of the remaining two spirits in the navel. A thick smoke breathes from both the wound and the serpent's mouth, joining. The spirit's legs and thighs compact, the tail splits and takes the spirit's lost form, its skin softening while the spirit's hardens. The shoulders join the monster's armpits, feet lengthen, and the man's private parts cleave in twain. As the smoke covers them, one rises upright (the man transformed into a serpent), and the other falls prone (the serpent transformed into a man). Their features change. The new man's face retreats, growing ears, a nose, and lips. The new serpent's visage sharpens, ears draw into its head, and its tongue severs. The serpent hisses and glides off, while the new man speaks of Buoso (the third spirit) crawling along this path. The narrator saw the ""unsteady ballast of the seventh hold"" (the spirits) fluctuate. He notes Sciancato, the only one of the three who didn't change.

**Canto XXVI:** The narrator chastises Florence for having such plundering citizens. He foresees future woe for Florence. He and Virgil remount the steep, using hands and feet. He feels sorrow at the memory of what he saw and resolves to rein his natural powers, ensuring they are guided by virtue. He sees the eighth chasm, filled with numberless flames, like fireflies. Each flame envelops a sinner so completely that none exhibits their form. The narrator bends forward on the bridge to look, nearly falling. Virgil explains these flames contain spirits. The narrator asks who is in a flame that seems parted at the summit, like the Theban brothers' funeral pile. Virgil identifies Ulysses and Diomede, enduring penal tortures together for their past deceptions (the Trojan horse, Achilles' abduction, the Palladium theft). The narrator eagerly asks to speak to the ""horned flame."" Virgil grants permission but says he will question them, as they were Greeks and might shun discourse with the narrator. The flame (Ulysses) approaches. Virgil addresses the two spirits within the flame, asking one to reveal how death overtook him. The greater horn of the flame rolls and speaks. Ulysses recounts escaping Circe and how neither love for his son nor father nor Penelope could overcome his zeal to explore the world, man's evil and virtue. He sailed with one bark and a small band to the Strait of Hercules, which was the boundary for man. He passed Seville and Ceuta. He urged his companions to explore the unpeopled world beyond, not to live like brutes but to pursue virtue and knowledge. They turned their poop to the dawn, making their oars wings, gaining on the left. They saw the stars of the other pole and their own setting. Five times the moon had renewed since they began. A dim, lofty mountain appeared, bringing joy, then mourning. A whirlwind from the new land struck their vessel, whirling it thrice, then lifting the poop and sinking the prow, closing the booming billow over them.

**Canto XXVII:** The flame (Ulysses) rises, silent. Another flame follows. From its top, a confused sound emerges, turning into dismal words, then clear speech. The spirit within (Guido da Montefeltro, implied) asks the narrator if Romagna has peace or war, identifying himself as from the mountains between Urbino and the Tyber's source. Virgil tells the narrator to speak, as he is a Latian. The narrator replies that Romagna is always at war in its tyrants' bosoms. He reports on Ravenna's stability, the Polenta eagle, the old and young mastiff of Verruchio, the lion of the snowy lair (for Lamone and Santerno), and the city by Savio's wave, living between tyranny and liberty. He then asks the spirit's name. The fire roars, then speaks, saying he would not reveal himself if he thought the narrator could return to the world and spread infamy. He was a man of arms, then clothed himself in Saint Francis's girdle, hoping for amends, but was seduced by ""the high priest"" (Pope Boniface VIII, implied) back into sin. He describes himself as a fox, cunning. Boniface, waging war near the Lateran, sought his counsel to destroy Penestrino. Boniface offered absolution for the sin before it was committed, promising to ""shut and open"" heaven. The spirit (Guido) yielded, advising Boniface to make ""large promise with performance scant"" to triumph. When he died, Saint Francis came for him, but a dark cherub claimed him for his deceitful counsel, stating that impenitent absolution is impossible and one cannot repent and will at once. The demon bore him to Minos, who coiled his tail eight times, condemning him to the fire. The spirit, in sorrow, writhing, then departs. They move onward up the rock to another arch.

**Canto XXVIII:** The narrator finds it impossible to describe the wounds and blood he now sees in the ninth chasm. He compares it to all the blood spilled in Apulia's wars, saying even that would be nothing to this sight. He sees a spirit torn from chin to hinder passage, with dangling entrails and exposed midriff. This spirit (Mohammed) cries out, showing his wounds, saying he is mangled and Ali weeps before him, cleft from chin to forelock. All here sowed scandal and schism and therefore are rent. A fiend hacks them with a sword, and their gashes close only to be reopened after they complete their circuit. Mohammed asks who the narrator is. Virgil explains the narrator is alive, not condemned, and is guided by him (Virgil) through hell to experience their state. Over a hundred spirits pause in amazement. Mohammed asks the narrator to warn Dolcino (a heretic) to arm himself with food to avoid being taken by Novara's power, lest he follow him here. Mohammed departs. Another shade, throat pierced, nostrils mutilated, and one ear lopt (Piero da Medicina), advances. He asks the narrator to recall him to Piero da Medicina, and to tell Guido and Angelo (sons of Fano) that they will be cast forth and drowned by a perfidious tyrant near Cattolica. He says Neptune never saw such foul injury. The ""one-eyed traitor"" (Malatestino da Rimini, implied) will bring them to a conference and shape their end. The narrator asks who the one-eyed traitor is. Piero points to a fellow spirit (Curio) whose throat was cut. Another maimed spirit (Mosca de' Lamberti) lifts his bleeding stumps, crying, ""Remember Mosca,"" whose saying ""The deed once done there is an end"" brought sorrow to Tuscany. The narrator adds, ""Ay, and death to thine own tribe."" Mosca hurries off in madness. The narrator lingers, seeing a headless trunk bearing its severed head like a lantern, speaking ""Woe’s me!"" It says it is Bertrand de Born, who gave King John (Henry II of England's son) mischievous counsel, setting father and son at mutual war. For this, his brain is parted from its source, justly suffering retribution.

**Canto XXIX:** The narrator, inebriated by the view of the wounded multitude, wishes to stay and weep. Virgil reminds him of the valley's length and limited time. The narrator explains he was looking for a kinsman (Geri of Bello) wailing for his crime. Virgil says he saw Geri point menacingly at the narrator but that the narrator was too engrossed with Bertrand de Born to notice. The narrator explains Geri's violent, unavenged death made him contemptuous. They reach the next valley, the last cloister of Malebolge. Loud laments assail them. The narrator compares the stench and suffering to all the sickness of Valdichiana, Sardinia, and Maremma combined in one foss. They descend to the left. The narrator sees naked spirits piled up, lying confusedly, some crawling. He sees two spirits (Griffolino d'Arezzo and Capocchio) sitting, propped against each other, covered in tetters, furiously scratching. The narrator asks if any Latian (Italian) is among them. One (Griffolino) replies both are from Latium and asks who the narrator is. Virgil replies he is guiding a living man through hell. The two spirits tremble. The narrator asks their names and race, promising lasting fame. Griffolino says he was from Arezzo and Albero of Siena burned him for claiming he could fly (a joke), but his true crime was alchemy, for which Minos doomed him to this chasm. The narrator comments on the frivolous nature of Siena. The other spirit (Capocchio) replies, defending certain Sienese (Stricca, Niccolo, Caccia of Asciano, Abbagliato) from the narrator's scorn. He identifies himself as Capocchio, who forged metals by alchemy, and reminds the narrator how he aped creative nature.

**Canto XXX:** The narrator recounts mythological examples of furious madness (Athamas, Hecuba). He then sees two naked, pale ghosts wildly scampering like swine. One reaches Capocchio and drags him by the neck. The other (Griffolino d'Arezzo) trembles and identifies the first as Schicchi (Gianni Schicchi), who counterfeited Donati's features to affix a false testament. He identifies the second as Myrrha, who lusted for her father and assumed a false shape. When these furies vanish, the narrator sees other spirits. One is shaped like a lute, suffering from dropsy, its limbs disproportionate, gasping for water. This spirit (Maestro Adamo) explains he coveted greatly in life but now craves a single drop of water. The sight of Casentino's rills torments him more than his disease. He says he falsified the florin with the Baptist's form at Romena. He wishes to see Guido, Alessandro, or their brother. He explains he is fettered and cannot move. He says he was induced by them to alloy the florins with three carats. The narrator asks about two spirits smoking beside Adamo. Adamo says he found them there when he dropped into the gulf; they are the false accuser of the Hebrew youth (Potiphar's wife) and Sinon, the false Greek from Troy, burning with fever. Sinon, angered by Adamo's words, strikes him on the paunch. Adamo strikes back. They exchange insults about their respective sins: Adamo's false coining and Sinon's false testimony about the Trojan horse and his thirst. The narrator is fixed on listening, but Virgil admonishes him, saying he will quarrel if the narrator continues to listen, calling such wrangling a joy for vulgar minds. The narrator is ashamed.

**Canto XXXI:** The tongue that rebuked the narrator now offers cure (like Achilles' javelin). They leave the valley of woe. In the dim twilight, the narrator hears a loud horn blast, louder than Orlando's. He sees many lofty towers, but Virgil explains these are giants, immersed from the navel down around the bank. He points out Nimrod, whose ""ill counsel"" caused the confusion of tongues (Tower of Babel). They move left to another, fiercer giant, Ephialtes, bound with chains. Virgil explains he tried to defy Jove. The narrator wishes to see Briareus, but Virgil says Antaeus, who is unfettered and speaks, will soon place them at the depth of guilt. They reach Antaeus, who emerges five ells without his head from the cave. Virgil addresses Antaeus, recalling his past feats and asking him to place them below, where Cocytus' cold locks all. He promises Antaeus renown in the upper world through the narrator. Antaeus stretches his hands, catches Virgil (and the narrator held by Virgil), and lowers them gently into the abyss where Lucifer and Judas are engulfed.

**Canto XXXII:** The narrator wishes for rough rhymes to describe this new, wretched place. They stand in a dark pit, far below the giants. A voice warns him not to tread on the heads of his brethren. He sees a frozen lake (Cocytus), thicker than the Danube or Tanais in winter. Spirits are frozen in it, blue-pinched and shrin'd in ice, teeth chattering. Their faces are held downward, eyes showing dolour. He sees two spirits so strictly joined their hairs are mingled. He asks who they are. They bend their necks, and their tears freeze their eyes shut. They clash like enraged goats. One (CCamicion de' Pazzi), whose ears are reft by the cold, asks why the narrator speculates. He identifies himself as Camicione and his companion as two brothers from the Bisenzio valley, sons of Alberto (Alessandro and Napoleone degli Alberti). He says no one in Caina is more worthy of congealment, not even Focaccia or Mascheroni. He awaits his kinsman Carlino, whose deep guilt will wash out his own. The narrator sees a thousand doggish grins. As they move towards the middle, the narrator accidentally kicks a head. The spirit cries out, asking if he seeks revenge for Montaperti. The narrator, wanting to resolve his doubt, asks the spirit who he is. The spirit (Bocca degli Abati) retorts, asking who the narrator is, roaming Antenora. The narrator says he is living and can give him fame. Bocca says he desires the opposite. The narrator seizes his hair and pulls out tufts. Another spirit cries, ""What ails thee, Bocca? Barkest thou outright?"" Bocca, silenced, replies, ""Tell what thou list; but as thou escape from hence to speak of him whose tongue hath been so glib, forget not: here he wails the Frenchman's gold."" He identifies him as Buoso da Duera. He also points out Beccaria, Soldanieri, Ganellon, and Tribaldello. They move on. The narrator sees two spirits frozen in one hollow, one's head a cowl to the other. The uppermost (Count Ugolino) gnaws the other's brain (Archbishop Ruggieri). The narrator asks the cause of such hate, promising to repay him in the world above if his grievance is just.

**Canto XXXIII:** The gnawing sinner (Count Ugolino) wipes his jaws on the mangled head and begins to speak. He says the narrator's request makes him relive sorrow. He will speak and weep to bring eternal infamy to the traitor he gnaws, Archbishop Ruggieri. He recounts how Ruggieri, through ill thoughts, imprisoned and murdered him. He describes a small grate (called the Tower of Famine) where he saw several moons pass. He had an evil dream: Ruggieri hunting a wolf and its whelps (Ugolino and his sons) in the mountains with lean hounds (Lanfranchi, Sismondi, Gualandi). He saw the tusks gore their sides. He awoke to his sons crying for bread. He describes his own stony silence, his sons' weeping, and little Anslem asking, ""Father what ails thee?"" He remained silent for a day and night. When a faint beam entered the prison, he saw his own image in his sons' faces and bit his hands in agony. His sons, thinking he bit from hunger, offered their own flesh. He kept his spirit still. They were silent for two more days. On the fourth day, Geddo died at his feet. Between the fifth and sixth day, the other three sons died one by one. Then, blind, he groped over them for three days, calling their names, until ""fasting got the mastery of grief."" He then resumes gnawing the skull. The narrator curses Pisa for its lack of justice, wishing for Capraia and Gorgona to dam the Arno and drown its people. He argues that even if Ugolino betrayed castles, his children (Brigata, Ugaccione, and two gentle ones) were too young to be guilty. They move on. Others are reversed in ice, weeping, but their tears freeze, increasing their anguish. The narrator feels a wind and asks Virgil about it, as he thought all vapor was quenched. Virgil replies they will soon see the cause. One spirit (Friar Alberigo) cries out, asking them to remove the hardened veil from his face so he can vent his grief. The narrator promises aid if he reveals his identity. Alberigo identifies himself as Friar Alberigo, who plucked ""evil fruitage"" and is repaid with ""luscious fig"" here. The narrator exclaims, ""Art thou too dead!"" Alberigo explains that Ptolomea (this region of hell) has the privilege of receiving souls even before their bodies die. A fiend takes possession of the betrayer's body, which then lives on earth until its appointed time, while the soul falls here. He says the narrator knows another ghost (Branca Doria) who winters here, though he appears alive on earth. The narrator expresses disbelief, saying Branca Doria still eats, drinks, and sleeps. Alberigo explains that Branca Doria left a demon in his stead in his own body, and so did a kinsman who wrought treachery with him. Alberigo asks the narrator to open his eyes. The narrator refuses, saying ""Ill manners were best courtesy to him."" The narrator curses Genoese for their foulness, noting Branca Doria is in Cocytus in soul, yet seems alive in body.

**Canto XXXIV:** Virgil points out ""Hell's Monarch"" (Lucifer) and his banners approaching. The narrator sees what resembles a windmill in the distance. He hides behind Virgil. They arrive where souls are whelmed transparent under ice, some prone, upright, or arched. Virgil makes the narrator pause and points out Dis (Lucifer), telling him to arm his heart with strength. The narrator is frozen and faint, unable to describe his state. Lucifer is at mid-breast from the ice, taller than a giant. He has three faces: vermilion in front, wan and yellow on the right, and black on the left. Two enormous bat-like wings flap, producing three winds that freeze Cocytus. He weeps from six eyes, and bloody foam distills down three chins. Each mouth champs a sinner. The foremost is Judas, head within, feet without. The other two, heads under, are Brutus (writhing, speechless) and Cassius. Virgil says night re-ascends, and it's time to go. The narrator clasps Virgil's neck. Virgil descends, stepping between the shaggy fell and jagged ice. At the point where the thigh turns on the haunches, Virgil painfully turns himself around, grappling the fell as one who mounts, making the narrator think they are returning to hell. Virgil, panting, explains this is the way to depart from extreme evil. They emerge at a rocky opening. The narrator expects to see Lucifer with legs downward, but sees him with legs upward. He wonders how he passed the center of the earth. Virgil explains that they were on the other side of the center until he turned, and then they crossed the point where all heavy substance is dragged. They are now in the opposite hemisphere, where morning rises when it is evening in the narrator's world. Lucifer fell from heaven to this part, and the earth recoiled, forming the seas in the narrator's hemisphere. Virgil explains a hidden way, discovered not by sight but by the sound of a brooklet, winds along a rock. By that hidden way, they exit, climbing without repose. They eventually see the ""beautiful lights of heav'n"" through a circular opening, and ""again beheld the stars.""

**PURGATORY**

**Canto I:** The narrator, having left the ""cruel sea"" of Hell, now begins his account of Purgatory, a region where the human spirit is purged for Heaven. He sees a serene sky of eastern sapphire and four bright stars never seen before by humans (save the ""first parents""). He then encounters an old man, Cato of Utica, who questions their escape from ""th' eternal prison-house"" and whether the statutes of the abyss are broken. Virgil makes the narrator show reverence. Virgil explains that a ""Dame from heaven"" (Beatrice) dispatched him to rescue the narrator, who had strayed near damnation. He has shown the narrator Hell and now intends to show him the spirits purged from sin. He appeals to Cato by the love for his chaste Marcia, asking permission to pass through the seven regions, promising to thank Marcia in the upper world. Cato, bound by a different law since leaving Hell, agrees only because a heavenly dame sent them. He instructs Virgil to gird the narrator with a slender reed and lave his face with dew to remove the ""sordid stain,"" as it would be unseemly to appear before the angel at the gate. He directs them to the reed-covered oozy bed near the water. Cato disappears. Virgil and the narrator descend to the plain, where Virgil washes the narrator's face with dew and girds him with a reed. Wherever a reed is plucked, another immediately springs up.

**Canto II:** The sun is at Jerusalem's meridian. They linger by the water. A swift light approaches over the sea, which Virgil identifies as ""God’s angel."" He instructs the narrator to kneel, as this angel needs no oars or sails, using only his eternal wings. The angel, visibly blessed, lands a small bark carrying over a hundred spirits. They sing ""In Exitu Israel de Aegypto."" The angel blesses them, and they leap ashore, then he returns as swiftly as he came. The new spirits, astounded, ask for directions to the mountain. Virgil replies they are also strangers, having arrived by a rougher road. The spirits realize the narrator is alive and are amazed, flocking around him. One spirit, Casella, rushes to embrace the narrator. The narrator attempts to embrace the shadow three times. Casella smiles and asks why the narrator is there. The narrator explains he journeys to return to a better life and asks why Casella is late. Casella explains the angel takes whom he chooses, and he has only recently been granted passage from the Tiber's mouth. The narrator asks Casella to sing a sweet love song. Casella sings ""Love that discourses in my thoughts,"" delighting all. The old man (Cato) then scolds the ""tardy spirits"" for loitering, urging them to run to the mountain. The spirits hasten away, and the narrator and Virgil depart with hurried steps.

**Canto III:** The spirits scatter towards the mountain. The narrator stays close to Virgil, who seems smitten with self-remorse. The narrator notices the sun's rays are broken by his body. He fears being left alone. Virgil reassures him, explaining that his body (buried in Naples) casts a shadow, but here one ray does not obstruct another. He says it is insane to hope human reason can explore the mystery of the Trinity. He mentions Plato and Aristotle (Stagyrite) fruitlessly desiring, and bends his forehead in troubled mood. They reach the mountain's foot, finding it too steep to climb. Virgil wonders which way it declines. The narrator sees spirits slowly approaching and points them out. Virgil agrees to approach them. The spirits halt a thousand paces away. Virgil addresses them as ""spirits perfect,"" asking for directions to the easiest ascent. The spirits, like cautious sheep, move forward. When they see the narrator's shadow, they stop and retreat. Virgil explains the narrator is a human body, aspiring to climb ""not without Virtue deriv’d from Heaven."" The spirits signal an entrance. One spirit (Manfredi) asks the narrator to turn his face if he has seen him. The narrator sees a comely man with a gash on one brow. The narrator says he hasn't seen him. The spirit shows a wound on his breast, smiles, and identifies himself as Manfredi, grandson to Queen Costanza. He asks the narrator to tell his daughter (mother of Aragon and Sicily's pride) the truth: that though his sins were horrible, he repented before death and was forgiven by God. He recounts that after his body was shattered, he turned to God. He states that if Cosenza's shepherd (Pope Clement IV's agent) had better understood divine mercy, his bones would have lain near Benevento, but instead, they were scattered by wind and rain beyond the kingdom's bounds. He explains that those who die in contumacy against the church, even if they repent, must wander ""thirty-fold for all the time In his presumption past,"" unless prayers from good men shorten it. He asks the narrator to reveal his state to Costanza and the terms of his interdict, as prayers from the living benefit them.

**Canto IV:** The narrator realizes he was engrossed in Manfredi's story, as the sun had moved fifty steps unnoticed. The spirits shout, ""Here is what ye ask."" They ascend a narrow, steep path, requiring both hands and feet. The narrator expresses weariness. Virgil encourages him, pointing to a circling track. They sit, facing eastward. The narrator notices the sun is on their left. Virgil explains this is due to their position on the round mountain relative to Jerusalem (Sion), and the sun's course. The narrator understands that the equator appears northern here. He asks how much further they have to journey. Virgil replies the ascent is difficult at first but gets easier, and when it feels easy, they will have reached the end of this path. A voice nearby says, ""Yet ye first perchance May to repose you by constraint be led."" They see a huge stone and some spirits standing behind it idly. One, very weary, sits with his face bent between his knees. The narrator points him out as idle. The spirit, Belacqua, lifts his face and encourages the narrator to proceed, noting the sun's position. The narrator laughs, then asks Belacqua why he sits there, waiting for escort. Belacqua explains he cannot ascend until he has waited as long as he delayed repentance in life, unless prayers from those in grace aid him. Virgil urges the narrator to haste, noting the sun has reached meridian and night covers Morocco.

**Canto V:** As they proceed, a spirit points at the narrator, noting the light doesn't shine from his left (because he's casting a shadow) and he seems alive. Others gaze in wonder. Virgil tells the narrator not to be distracted by their whispers and to continue like a firm tower. They hear a group singing ""Miserere."" When these spirits see the narrator casts a shadow, their song changes to an exclamation. Two run ahead to ask about their condition. Virgil tells them his frame is real flesh and they should honor him. The messengers quickly return and the whole troop wheels back towards them. Virgil tells the narrator that many are coming to petition him, so he should listen as he goes. The spirits shout, asking the living narrator to stay and look if he knows any of them, so he can report tidings. They explain they died by violence and were sinners until their latest hour, but repented and forgave, dying at peace with God. The narrator says he recognizes none but will perform any service they ask. One spirit, Jacopo del Cassero, speaks first, asking the narrator to pray for him in Fano (between Romagna and Charles' realm). He recounts his violent death in ""Antenor’s land,"" pursued by Este's prince. He would have lived if he had fled to Mira instead of the marsh where he fell and his life-blood flowed. Another spirit, Buonconte da Montefeltro, asks for aid, saying Giovanna (his wife or daughter) no longer cares for him. The narrator asks how he died at Campaldino. Buonconte explains he was pierced in the heart, fleeing on foot by the Archiano river, where sight and speech failed, ending with Mary's name. He says God's angel took him, while a demon claimed the eternal part of him for ""one poor tear."" The demon then raised a wind and smoky mist, causing a flood that carried Buonconte's body into the Arno, tearing the cross he made on his breast. A third spirit, Pia de' Tolomei, asks to be remembered when the narrator returns to the world. She says Siena gave her life, Maremma took it, and her husband knows why.

**Canto VI:** The narrator describes escaping the throng of spirits who begged for prayers, like a gambler surrounded by others after a win. He saw Jacopo del Cassero, Buonconte da Montefeltro, Frederic Novello, and Peter de la Brosse (whose soul was dismissed for spite and envy, not crime, and he warns the Lady of Brabant). The narrator asks Virgil why these spirits entreat prayers, if divine decrees cannot be bent. Virgil explains that his writing is plain, and their hope is not vain if the prayers come from a heart in grace and from below, as love can fulfill in a short moment what they would otherwise satisfy over time. He advises the narrator not to rest content unless Beatrice clarifies it. Virgil notes the day is declining and urges faster speed. Virgil points out a solitary spirit (Sordello) watching them. Virgil asks Sordello the best ascent. Sordello asks their country and life. When Virgil says ""Mantua,"" Sordello embraces him, identifying himself as a countryman. The narrator then laments Italy's slavish, war-torn state, ruled by tyrants. He blames German Albert (Emperor Albert I) for neglecting Italy and wishes for divine judgment on his bloodline. He calls on Albert to see the feuding families (Capulets, Montagues, Philippeschi, Monaldi) and the suffering of Rome, deserted by its ""Caesar."" He chides Florence for its rapid change of laws and customs.

**Canto VII:** After embracing, Sordello asks who Virgil is. Virgil replies he is Virgil, buried by Octavius, deprived of heaven for lack of faith, and now guides this living man through hell and Purgatory. He explains he abides in Limbo with innocents and those who lacked faith. He asks Sordello to direct them to the true beginning of Purgatory. Sordello says they have no fixed place but will guide them as far as he can. He notes that they cannot ascend by night. He suggests they choose a pleasant sojourn, leading them to a group of spirits sitting apart to the right. The narrator asks why they cannot ascend at night. Sordello explains that night shades perplex the will, preventing upward movement. Virgil asks to be led quickly to the pleasant place. They move a short distance and find a hollowed-out mountain valley. Sordello points out where the high bank recedes, telling them to await daylight there. They take a crooked path into the ridge, arriving at a fair recess adorned with gold, silver, scarlet, ceruse, Indian wood, and emeralds, surpassing nature's beauty and filled with sweet fragrance. They see spirits sitting on the grass singing ""Salve Regina."" Virgil tells the narrator that before sunset, they will discern the acts and visages of all present better than mixing among them. He points out Emperor Rodolph, who sits highest, neglecting to heal Italy's wounds. Next, Ottocar, who was more worthy in swaddling clothes than his son Winceslaus. Then, one with a depressed nose (Philip III of France), who died fleeing, ""with'ring the lily’s flower."" He points out two others (Philip IV's father and father-in-law) grieving for his vicious life. He points out a robust man (Henry of Navarre) who kept measure in song and bore his girdle braced with virtue. He also mentions James and Frederick, who hold his realms. He speaks of the degeneration of the plant (royal lineage). He points out Henry of England, sitting alone, who spreads better issue. Lastly, William, the brave Marquis, whose actions cause Conferrat and Canavese to weep.

**Canto VIII:** It is evening, a time that evokes longing. A spirit rises and signals for silence, then joins both palms and looks eastward, singing ""Te Lucis Ante"" so devoutly that the narrator is entranced. The others follow in song. The narrator is told to be keen, as a subtle veil of truth is present. The gentle band looks up, and two angels with flame-illuminated, broken swords descend, green-vestured with green wings. One stands above, the other on the opposing hill, containing the troop. Sordello identifies them as angels from Mary's bosom, guarding against ""the serpent."" The narrator, frozen, presses close to Virgil. Sordello leads them down into the valley, suggesting they converse with the great shadows. The narrator sees Nino Visconti, whom he joyfully recognizes. Nino asks how long since the narrator arrived. The narrator says he came from hell this morning, still alive, journeying to gain the other life. Nino and Sordello are amazed. Nino calls to a seated spirit, Conrad Malaspina, to witness God's grace. Nino then asks the narrator to tell his Giovanna to pray for him, believing his mother (his wife) no longer loves him, having changed her mourning clothes, demonstrating how quickly love fades without sight and touch. He says her burial will not be as grand as the ""viper which calls Milan to the field"" (Visconti of Milan) had made. He stamps his visage with a glowing seal. The narrator, meanwhile, looks to the stars. Virgil asks what he sees. The narrator identifies ""three torches"" (stars) that have risen in place of the four he saw that morning. Sordello points out ""our enemy"" (the serpent). A serpent, like the one that tempted Eve, lies along the side of the valley. The celestial falcons (angels) descend, and the serpent flees. The angels return. Conrad Malaspina (the spirit Nino called to) asks the narrator for news of Valdimagra, where he was once mighty. He identifies himself as Conrad Malaspina (the younger). The narrator replies he has never been there but knows the fame of their house, swearing their nation does not impair the value of its coffer or sword, and walks aright while the world is twisted by a bad head. Conrad replies that before seven revolutions of the sun, this opinion (about his house's virtue) will be nailed into the narrator's brain with stronger nails than any words, if judgment is not stayed.

**Canto IX:** It is near dawn. The narrator, overcome with sleep, falls on the grass. He dreams of a golden-feathered eagle snatching him up to the fire, where both burn. He wakes, shaking like Achilles. Virgil stands beside him, telling him not to fear, that they are at Purgatory. He explains that a lady named Lucia came and carried the sleeping narrator to this summit from the flowery valley below, for an easier ascent. She then vanished. The narrator is comforted. They ascend a cliff. They approach a portal with three steps of different colors: white marble, dark cracked block, flaming red porphyry. An angel sits on the highest step (a diamond threshold), holding a naked sword. The angel asks who they are and their escort. Virgil replies a heavenly dame directed them. The angel, courteously, bids them enter. The narrator cast himself at the angel's feet, asking for pity. The angel inscribes seven P-shaped letters (for ""pe"
The Great Gatsby-F. Scott Fitzgerald,"Nick Carraway, a young man from the Middle West, moves to West Egg, Long Island, in the spring of 1922 to learn the bond business. He rents a modest house situated next to a colossal mansion belonging to the enigmatic Jay Gatsby.

Nick visits his second cousin, Daisy Buchanan, and her wealthy, former football star husband, Tom Buchanan, at their opulent home in fashionable East Egg. Tom is portrayed as arrogant and physically imposing. At dinner, they are joined by Jordan Baker, a professional golfer. During the evening, Tom receives a phone call, which Jordan reveals to Nick is from Tom's mistress in New York. Daisy, visibly upset, expresses cynical views, confessing her hope that her three-year-old daughter will grow up to be a ""beautiful little fool."" Jordan mentions Gatsby's name, sparking Daisy's curiosity. Later, Nick sees Gatsby standing alone on his lawn, stretching his arms toward a distant green light across the bay, which Nick identifies as the light at the end of Daisy's dock.

Tom takes Nick to New York, stopping in the ""valley of ashes,"" a desolate industrial area between West Egg and the city. There, they visit George B. Wilson's run-down garage. Wilson is a ""spiritless"" man, and his wife, Myrtle, is Tom's mistress. Tom arranges to meet Myrtle in New York. In the city, Myrtle changes into an elaborate dress, buys a dog, and takes Tom and Nick to a small apartment she shares with Tom. More guests arrive: Myrtle's sister, Catherine, and Mr. and Mrs. McKee. Catherine reveals a rumor that Gatsby is a relative of Kaiser Wilhelm and that he gets his money from this connection. She also confides that neither Tom nor Myrtle can stand their spouses and wish to marry each other, but Daisy is supposedly Catholic and doesn't believe in divorce (a lie, Nick notes). Myrtle recounts how she met Tom and her regret over marrying Wilson. As the evening progresses, fueled by alcohol, Myrtle taunts Tom by repeatedly shouting ""Daisy!"" Tom, in a fit of rage, strikes her and breaks her nose. Nick leaves with Mr. McKee.

Nick attends one of Gatsby's famous, lavish parties. He is one of the few invited guests and feels out of place among the many uninvited revelers who spread rumors about Gatsby's past (e.g., that he killed a man or was a German spy). Nick meets Jordan Baker there, and they encounter a drunk man in Gatsby's library, dubbed ""Owl Eyes,"" who is surprised to find Gatsby's books are real. Later, Nick converses with a man who reveals himself to be Gatsby. Gatsby is a young, elegant man, not the older, corpulent figure Nick expected. Gatsby is called away by a phone call. Jordan tells Nick that Gatsby claims to be an Oxford man, but she doesn't believe him. Jordan then hints at ""the most amazing thing"" she learned from Gatsby but refuses to reveal it. As Nick leaves, he witnesses a car crash outside Gatsby's mansion, involving the ""Owl Eyes"" man as a passenger.

One morning, Gatsby visits Nick and invites him to lunch in New York. Gatsby attempts to tell Nick about his past, claiming to be the son of wealthy, deceased Middle Westerners, educated at Oxford, a war hero with medals (which he shows Nick), and a world traveler. Nick is initially skeptical but the physical evidence persuades him. Gatsby reveals he has a ""big request"" for Nick, which Jordan Baker will explain. He then mentions passing Mrs. Wilson at the garage. On the way to the city, Gatsby uses a white card to avoid a speeding ticket. In New York, Gatsby introduces Nick to Meyer Wolfshiem, a gambler with human molar cufflinks, who reveals he ""made"" Gatsby and that Gatsby fixed the 1919 World's Series. Tom Buchanan then appears in the restaurant, and Gatsby mysteriously vanishes after being introduced.

Jordan Baker finally reveals Gatsby's ""big request"" during tea: Gatsby bought his mansion in West Egg specifically to be across the bay from Daisy. He wants Nick to invite Daisy to his house for tea so he can meet her again and show her his house, being too afraid to ask directly. Jordan recounts Daisy's past: in 1917, Daisy, then 18, was deeply in love with Lieutenant Jay Gatsby. Her family prevented her from leaving to say goodbye to him before he went overseas. She later married Tom Buchanan, who gave her a $350,000 pearl necklace. The night before her wedding, Daisy received a letter (presumably from Gatsby), got drunk, and almost called off the wedding. After their marriage, Tom had a car accident with another woman. Jordan concludes that Daisy recognized Gatsby's name recently and realized he was the officer she once knew. Nick agrees to help Gatsby, and in a moment of connection, puts his arm around Jordan and asks her to dinner.

Nick arranges the tea. Gatsby is incredibly nervous, sending a gardener to cut Nick's lawn and bringing flowers and cakes. When Daisy arrives, Gatsby briefly disappears, then re-enters, pale and trembling. Their reunion is awkward at first, but after Nick leaves them alone, Daisy is tear-streaked but Gatsby is transformed, radiating happiness. Gatsby takes them to his mansion, where Daisy is awestruck. Gatsby changes his story, claiming it took him three years to earn the money, not inherit it, mentioning he was in the drug and oil businesses. He shows her his vast collection of expensive shirts, which causes Daisy to cry, saying they are ""so beautiful."" Gatsby points out the green light on Daisy's dock, now that she is present, implying its symbolic significance has vanished. They meet Klipspringer, the ""boarder,"" who reluctantly plays the piano. As Nick leaves, Gatsby and Daisy are engrossed in each other. Nick notes that Daisy ""tumbled short of his dreams,"" but her voice holds Gatsby captivated.

Gatsby's famous parties suddenly cease. Nick learns Gatsby dismissed his servants and replaced them with Wolfshiem's people to prevent gossip, as Daisy has been visiting him often. Gatsby asks Nick to arrange a lunch at Daisy's house. On a scorching summer day, Nick, Gatsby, Jordan, and Tom gather at the Buchanan's. Tom is on the phone, arguing about selling a car. Daisy publicly kisses Gatsby and tells him she loves him. Tom enters, and Daisy's young daughter, Pammy, is brought in; Gatsby seems surprised by her existence. The intense heat and underlying tension lead to a confrontation. Tom, realizing the affair, insists they all go to town. Daisy, to Tom's annoyance, suggests she ride with Gatsby in Tom's coupé, while Nick and Jordan ride with Tom in Gatsby's yellow car.

Driving to the city, Tom reveals to Nick and Jordan that he has investigated Gatsby, exposing his ""Oxford man"" claim as misleading (Gatsby only attended for five months after the war). They stop for gas at Wilson's garage. Wilson is sick and reveals he has discovered Myrtle's affair and plans to take her West. Myrtle, from an upstairs window, sees Tom with Jordan and mistakes Jordan for Tom's wife, her face filled with ""jealous terror."" Tom realizes Wilson's suspicions are confirmed.

At the Plaza Hotel suite, Tom confronts Gatsby. Gatsby demands Daisy tell Tom she never loved him, only Gatsby. Daisy, under pressure, admits she ""did love him once—but I loved you too."" Tom then exposes Gatsby's illegal activities, revealing his ""drugstores"" were a front for bootlegging alcohol, and accusing him of abandoning a partner who went to jail. Gatsby, cornered, says little. Daisy, terrified, can't bring herself to say she never loved Tom. Tom, regaining control, scornfully dismisses Gatsby's ""flirtation"" and tells Daisy to go home with Gatsby in Gatsby's car. Nick realizes it's his 30th birthday.

As Tom, Nick, and Jordan drive back to Long Island in Tom's coupé, they encounter an accident in the valley of ashes. Myrtle Wilson has been struck by a car and killed. Michaelis, a coffee shop owner, witnessed Myrtle run into the road. Other witnesses describe the car as a ""big yellow car. New."" Wilson, distraught, overhears this and declares he knows what kind of car it was. Tom, realizing Wilson suspects the yellow car (Gatsby's), quickly tells Wilson that the yellow car he was driving earlier wasn't his and that he just arrived from New York in his blue coupé, deflecting suspicion from himself. Tom weeps in the car, calling the hit-and-run driver a ""coward.""

Back at the Buchanan's, Nick sees Tom and Daisy sitting together, not happy but with an ""unmistakable air of natural intimacy,"" conspiring. Gatsby, who had been waiting outside the house to ensure Daisy's safety, confesses to Nick that Daisy was driving his yellow car when she hit Myrtle. He explains Daisy was nervous and wanted to drive, and Myrtle ran out into the road, possibly thinking it was Tom's car. Gatsby claims he will take the blame. Nick urges Gatsby to go home and get some sleep, but Gatsby insists on waiting all night, watching Daisy's house.

The next morning, Nick visits Gatsby, urging him to leave because his car will be traced. Gatsby refuses, saying he cannot leave Daisy until he knows what she will do. Gatsby shares more details of his past, revealing he was a penniless officer when he met Daisy and let her believe he was from her wealthy class, taking her under ""false pretences."" He admits he was committed to a ""grail"" in his pursuit of her. He recounts their original love and his desperate return to Louisville when she married Tom, feeling he had lost the ""freshest and the best"" part of his life. Gatsby still believes Daisy truly loves him.

The gardener announces he is draining the pool, but Gatsby tells him to wait, as he has never used it. Nick prepares to leave for the city, but delays, feeling a bond with Gatsby. As he finally departs, Nick shouts across the lawn, ""They’re a rotten crowd... You’re worth the whole damn bunch put together."" Gatsby smiles radiantly.

Nick attempts to work in the city. Jordan Baker calls, saying she has left Daisy's house and their relationship is over. Nick tries to call Gatsby but his line is busy, held for a long-distance call from Detroit. Nick learns that Gatsby's business dealings are being investigated.

Meanwhile, Michaelis returns to Wilson's garage. Wilson, still distraught, begins to talk about the yellow car and reveals that Myrtle had come home bruised months ago, leading him to believe she had a secret life. Looking at the eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg billboard, Wilson states, ""God sees everything,"" believing God will reveal the killer. Wilson then disappears. His movements are traced to West Egg, where he asks for directions to Gatsby's house.

At 2 PM, Gatsby puts on his bathing suit and goes to the pool, having told his butler to bring any phone calls there. The chauffeur heard gunshots. Nick arrives at Gatsby's house and, with the chauffeur, butler, and gardener, finds Gatsby's body floating in the pool. The gardener then discovers Wilson's body in the grass nearby. The ""holocaust was complete.""

In the aftermath, police and reporters swarm Gatsby's house. At the inquest, Catherine, Myrtle's sister, falsely testifies that Myrtle never knew Gatsby and was happy with Wilson, simplifying the case to Wilson being ""deranged by grief."" Nick feels responsible for Gatsby, as no one else seems to care. He calls Daisy, but she and Tom have left town without a trace. Nick tries to contact Meyer Wolfshiem, who refuses to get involved, expressing shock but claiming business obligations. Gatsby's father, Henry C. Gatz, arrives from Minnesota, a solemn old man. He shows Nick Gatsby's childhood schedule and ""General Resolves"" from a book, revealing Gatsby's early ambition.

At Gatsby's funeral, only Nick, Mr. Gatz, the Lutheran minister, a few servants, and the ""Owl Eyes"" man attend. Nick is dismayed by the lack of attendees, especially Tom and Daisy. The ""Owl Eyes"" man remarks, ""The poor son-of-a-bitch.""

Nick decides to return West. He breaks off his relationship with Jordan Baker, who accuses him of carelessness. Nick later encounters Tom Buchanan in New York. Tom confesses he told Wilson who owned the yellow car, claiming Wilson was crazed and deserved what happened, and that Myrtle's death was a hit-and-run. Nick realizes that Tom and Daisy are ""careless people""—they ""smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness... and let other people clean up the mess they had made."" Nick leaves Tom, disgusted.

Gatsby's house stands empty. Nick visits it one last time before leaving. He reflects on Gatsby's pursuit of Daisy, which was tied to the green light at the end of her dock. Gatsby's dream of the future had always been just out of reach, eventually becoming part of the past. Nick concludes that ""we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past."""
The Iliad-Homer,"The provided text, ""The Iliad,"" details a significant period during the tenth year of the siege of Troy, focusing primarily on the wrath of Achilles and its consequences, culminating in the funeral of Hector.

**Book I: The Contention of Achilles and Agamemnon**
The narrative begins in the tenth year of the Trojan War. The Greeks, having sacked neighboring towns, captured two women, Chryseïs and Briseïs, allotting Chryseïs to Agamemnon and Briseïs to Achilles. Chryses, a priest of Apollo and father of Chryseïs, comes to the Greek camp offering gifts to ransom his daughter. Agamemnon refuses and insolently dismisses him. Chryses prays to Apollo for vengeance, and Apollo inflicts a pestilence on the Greeks.

Achilles calls a council, where the prophet Chalcas, encouraged by Achilles' promise of protection, reveals that Apollo's rage is due to Agamemnon's refusal to release Chryseïs. Agamemnon is compelled to return his captive but, enraged, enters into a furious contest with Achilles, threatening to take Briseïs from him. Nestor attempts to pacify them, advising Agamemnon not to seize Achilles' prize and Achilles not to contend with a king. Despite Nestor's efforts, Agamemnon, exercising his supreme command, seizes Briseïs from Achilles.

In discontent, Achilles withdraws himself and his Myrmidon forces from the Greek army. He complains to his mother, Thetis, who supplicates Jupiter (Jove) to honor her son by granting victory to the Trojans until the Greeks realize their wrong against Achilles. Jupiter grants her suit, which incenses Juno. A high debate ensues between them, eventually reconciled by Vulcan, who reminds them of his own past suffering at Jove's hands.

This book covers 22 days: nine days of plague, one day for the council and quarrel, and twelve days for Jupiter's absence with the Æthiopians before Thetis presents her petition.

**Book II: The Trial of the Army, and Catalogue of the Forces**
Jupiter, to fulfill Thetis's request and make the Greeks feel Achilles' absence, sends a deceitful vision to Agamemnon. The vision, appearing as Nestor, persuades Agamemnon to lead the army to battle, assuring him of Troy's imminent fall. Agamemnon, deluded but fearing the army is discouraged, plans a stratagem: he will propose a return to Greece to test their resolve, expecting the princes to stop them.

Agamemnon gathers the council and relays the dream, then assembles the whole host. When he proposes returning to Greece, the soldiers unanimously agree and rush to prepare their ships. Juno, seeing this, sends Minerva to intervene. Minerva finds Ulysses, who, prompted by the goddess, takes Agamemnon's scepter and detains the fleeing Greeks. He praises loyal warriors and rebukes common soldiers with blows and stern words, asserting Jove's divine right of kings.

The assembly is recalled. Thersites, a deformed and insolent common soldier, loudly insults Agamemnon, criticizing his greed and the seizure of Briseïs. Ulysses publicly chastises Thersites with blows from the scepter, drawing applause from the army. Ulysses then reminds the Greeks of Chalcas's prophecy at Aulis, where a serpent devouring nine birds (a mother bird and eight young) symbolized nine years of war followed by Troy's fall in the tenth. Nestor advises a general muster and division of troops by nations before battle. Agamemnon accepts, and after a hasty feast and prayers to Jove (which Jove refuses, preparing more woes for the Greeks), the troops are marshaled. Minerva, bearing Jove's ægis, inspires the Greeks with renewed courage. The text then provides a lengthy ""Catalogue of the Ships,"" enumerating the Greek forces and their leaders from various regions (Bœotia, Orchomenus, Phocis, Locris, Eubœa, Athens, Salamis, Argos, Mycenae, Sparta, Pylos, Arcadia, Elis, Echinades, Ithaca, Ætolia, Crete, Rhodes, Calydnae, Pelasgic Argos/Myrmidons, Phylace, Glaphyra, Methone, Oechalia, Ormenius, Perrhaebia, Magnesia). The Trojan forces are also listed, led by Hector, Æneas, Pandarus, Amphius, Adrastus, Asius, Hippothous, Pyleus, Acamas, Pyrous, Euphemus, Pylæmenes, Odius, Epistrophus, Chromis, Ennomus, Phorcys, Ascanius, Mestles, Antiphus, Amphimachus, Naustes, Glaucus, and Sarpedon.

**Book III: The Duel of Menelaus and Paris**
The armies are arrayed for battle. The Trojans advance with shouts, while the Greeks march silently and resolutely. Paris, appearing at the front, challenges the bravest Greek to single combat. Menelaus, recognizing Paris, eagerly confronts him. Paris, however, shrinks back in fear, hiding among the Trojan ranks. Hector upbraids Paris for his cowardice, reminding him of his abduction of Helen and challenging him to fight Menelaus.

Paris accepts, proposing a duel between himself and Menelaus to decide the war, with Helen and her treasures as the prize. The victor will claim her, and the nations will establish a lasting peace. Hector relays this challenge to the Greeks. Menelaus agrees, demanding two lambs for sacrifice (one black for Earth, one white for the Sun) and a third for Jupiter, to seal the inviolable oath. He also requests that King Priam come to sanction the truce, as his sons are ""faithless.""

Iris, disguised as Laodice, goes to Helen and calls her to the Scaean Gate to witness the duel. Helen, weaving a tapestry depicting the Trojan War, is moved by longing for her former husband and country. She goes to the gate with her handmaids, where Priam and the Trojan elders sit. The elders, though acknowledging Helen's destructive beauty, find her irresistibly charming. Priam kindly asks Helen to identify the Greek chiefs below, whom she points out: Agamemnon, Ulysses, and Ajax.

Priam and Antenor descend to the plain. The kings on both sides take solemn oaths for the combat's conditions. Priam then returns to Troy, unable to bear watching his son's danger. Hector and Ulysses prepare the lists for the duel. Lots are cast, and Paris is chosen to throw the first spear. Both heroes arm. Paris throws his spear first, striking Menelaus's shield but failing to pierce it. Menelaus then throws his spear, which pierces Paris's shield, corslet, and garment, but Paris evades the deadly blow. Menelaus then strikes Paris's helmet with his sword, but the sword shatters. He seizes Paris by the helmet crest and begins to drag him, intending to strangle him. Venus intervenes, breaking the helmet strap and whisking Paris away in a cloud to his perfumed bedchamber in Troy.

Menelaus, furious, casts the empty helmet among the Greeks and searches for Paris. Agamemnon declares Menelaus the victor, demanding the restoration of Helen and the agreed-upon fine. The Greeks loudly applaud.

**Book IV: The Breach of the Truce, and the First Battle**
The gods in council on Olympus debate the war's continuation. Jupiter, testing Juno, suggests ending the war with Helen's return and peace for Troy. Juno and Minerva, both partial to the Greeks, are enraged. Juno defiantly asserts her desire for Troy's destruction, offering her own favored cities (Mycenae, Argos, Sparta) for Jove to raze in return for his full support against Troy. Jove agrees to Troy's fate but warns Juno against future defiance. He dispatches Minerva to break the truce, making Troy the aggressor.

Minerva descends, disguised as Laodocus, and persuades Pandarus, Lycaon's son, to shoot an arrow at Menelaus, promising him glory and gifts from Paris. Pandarus, swayed, draws his bow, first vowing sacrifice to Apollo. The arrow flies, wounding Menelaus in the shoulder, where his belt and corslet meet, drawing purple blood. Agamemnon expresses dismay and grief, fearing for his brother's life and the broken truce, predicting Troy's eventual downfall and the destruction of Priam's line. Menelaus reassures him the wound is not fatal. Agamemnon sends Talthybius to summon Machaon, a skilled physician, who successfully extracts the arrow and applies healing balm.

With the truce broken, the Trojans rush to war. Agamemnon, appearing energized, rallies the Greek troops. He inspires the brave and shames the fearful, moving through the ranks. He praises Idomeneus and the Ajaces for their courage and admonishes Ulysses and Diomed for their perceived hesitation, though they quickly assert their readiness to fight. Nestor, with his wisdom, organizes the Pylian forces, placing chariots in front, foot soldiers behind, and less reliable troops in the middle. The battle joins fiercely.

Antilochus kills Echepolus, then is challenged by Agenor, who wounds him. Ulysses slays Democoon, a son of Priam. Apollo intervenes, rousing the Trojans and reminding them that Achilles is no longer fighting. Great Diores is killed by Pyrus, who in turn is slain by Thoas. The plain is covered with dead from both sides.

**Book V: The Acts of Diomed**
Pallas (Minerva) inspires Diomed, making him shine with divine light and empowering him to perform wonders. Diomed first kills Phegeus, a son of Dares, and would have killed Idæus if Vulcan hadn't saved him. Minerva then restrains Mars, suggesting they let mortals decide the fight for a while.

Diomed continues his rampage, killing Odius, Phæstus, Scamandrius, Phereclus, Pedaeus, and Hypsenor. Pandarus wounds Diomed with an arrow, piercing his breastplate, but it's not a fatal wound. Diomed, retreating briefly, prays to Minerva. She cures him, grants him the ability to distinguish gods from mortals, and permits him to wound any god except Apollo.

Æneas joins Pandarus to confront Diomed. Pandarus's spear hits Diomed's shield but does not pierce. Diomed's spear, guided by Pallas, pierces Pandarus's face, killing him instantly. Æneas stands over Pandarus's body to defend it, but Diomed hurls a massive stone, crushing Æneas's hip. Æneas would have died, but Venus, his mother, intervenes, shielding him and carrying him away from the battle. Diomed, recognizing Venus, pursues and wounds her hand with his spear, as Pallas had commanded. Venus cries out and drops Æneas, who is then rescued by Apollo in a cloud. Diomed insults the fleeing Venus, telling her to leave war to more martial gods.

Iris leads the wounded Venus to Mars, who lends her his chariot to return to Olympus. On Olympus, Dione comforts Venus, reminding her that gods also suffer at the hands of mortals (recounting instances of Mars, Juno, and Hades being wounded by Hercules). Juno and Pallas mock Venus, and Jove tells Venus to stick to love, not war.

Apollo carries Æneas to his temple in Troy, where Latona and Phoebe heal him. Apollo then creates a phantom of Æneas, which draws the Greeks back into battle. Mars, incited by Apollo (who has returned to the field), rallies the Trojans, telling them that Æneas is alive. Sarpedon, the Lycian leader, rebukes Hector for his inaction, urging him to fight harder and save Troy. Hector, stung, leaps from his chariot and renews the fight. Mars, Bellona, and Apollo actively aid the Trojans.

Diomed, Ulysses, and the Ajaces lead the Greek resistance. Agamemnon exhorts his troops. Diomed kills Deicoon, Æneas kills Orsilochus and Crethon. Menelaus attempts to fight Æneas but is joined by Antilochus, causing Æneas to retreat. Pylæmenes is killed by Menelaus, and Mydon by Antilochus. Hector charges, supported by Mars and Bellona. Diomed, recognizing Mars, advises the Greeks to retreat slowly, facing the enemy, as they are now fighting gods.

Ajax kills Amphius. Tlepolemus, a son of Hercules, challenges Sarpedon, a son of Jove. They exchange boasts and spears. Tlepolemus is killed by Sarpedon, but Sarpedon is wounded in the thigh. Sarpedon is carried from the field by his Lycian allies. Ulysses then slaughters many Lycians in revenge. Hector sees Sarpedon's distress and rushes to his aid, causing Ulysses to withdraw. Sarpedon, though still alive, asks Hector not to let the Greeks take his body. The Greeks and Trojans continue to fight furiously over Sarpedon's body. Mars and Hector drive the Greeks back, killing many. Juno and Minerva, observing the slaughter, decide to intervene, despite Jove's earlier warning. They arm themselves in divine, elaborate armor and chariots.

They descend to the battlefield. Juno shouts encouragement to the Greeks in Stentor's voice. Minerva finds Diomed, resting from his wound, and reproaches him for his perceived inaction, reminding him of his father Tydeus's bravery. She then empowers him, clears his vision to see gods, and tells him to attack Mars. Minerva mounts Diomed's chariot, hides her form with Pluto's helmet, and guides his spear to strike Mars in the groin. Mars bellows in pain and flees to Olympus, causing Earth and Heaven to tremble. He complains to Jove, who sternly rebukes him for his violent nature, but orders Pæon to heal him. Pæon does so, and Mars's wound is quickly healed. Juno and Pallas return to Olympus.

**Book VI: The Episodes of Glaucus and Diomed, and of Hector and Andromache**
With the gods withdrawn, the Greeks gain the upper hand. Ajax kills Acamas, and Diomed kills Axylus and his servant Calesius. Euryalus kills Dresus and the twins, Imbrius and Amphion. Polypœtes kills Astyalus, Ulysses kills Pidytes, Teucer kills Aretaon, Antilochus kills Ablerus, Agamemnon kills Elatus, and Eurypylus kills Melanthius.

Menelaus captures Adrastus, who begs for his life, offering a ransom. Menelaus is inclined to pity him, but Agamemnon sternly intervenes, demanding no Trojan be spared, and then kills Adrastus. Nestor encourages the Greeks to strip the slain only after victory.

The Trojan augur, Helenus, seeing the Greek success, advises Hector to return to Troy. He tells Hector to instruct his mother, Hecuba, and the Trojan matrons to lead a solemn procession to Minerva's temple, offering the goddess a prized mantle and twelve heifers to entreat her to remove Diomed from the fight. Hector, shaking two spears, rallies the Trojans and then departs for the city.

With Hector gone, the battle pauses. Glaucus, a Lycian leader, and Diomed meet between the armies. Diomed, recalling Minerva's warning about fighting gods, asks Glaucus about his lineage. Glaucus recounts his ancestry, tracing it back to Sisyphus, then Bellerophon, who performed heroic feats like slaying the Chimaera, fighting the Solymæans and Amazons, and surviving an ambush. Glaucus then identifies himself as Bellerophon's grandson. Diomed, recognizing that their grandfathers, Oeneus and Bellerophon, were bound by ties of hospitality, declares they are hereditary friends. They agree to avoid fighting each other and exchange armor as a sign of their renewed friendship. Glaucus foolishly exchanges his gold armor for Diomed's bronze, a hundred oxen's worth for nine.

Hector arrives at the Scaean Gate, where Trojan women and elders gather, anxious about the war. His mother, Hecuba, offers him wine, which he refuses due to his bloody hands, unfit for libation. He instructs her to go to Minerva's temple as Helenus advised. He then goes to find Paris, expressing his wish that Paris had died rather than cause such woe. Paris, found polishing his arms with Helen and her maids, admits his shame but asserts his readiness to fight, stating success comes from heaven. Helen expresses her self-loathing and wishes she had died before causing the war. She urges Hector to rest, but Hector refuses, stating his duty calls him to battle and to bid farewell to his wife and son.

Hector finds Andromache and their son, Astyanax, on the Scaean Tower. Andromache, weeping, begs Hector not to return to battle, fearing widowhood and orphanhood. She recounts how Achilles killed her father, Aëtion, and her seven brothers, but honored her father with a burial mound. She sees Hector as her family now. She pleads with him to defend the weakest part of the wall by the fig trees. Hector explains his duty to fight for Troy's glory, fearing the shame of being seen as a coward. He foresees Troy's fall and Andromache's fate as a captive slave. He then reaches for his son, but Astyanax cries, scared by Hector's horsehair helmet. Hector removes his helmet, embraces and prays to Jove for his son to become a great warrior, even greater than himself. He returns his son to Andromache, comforts her, and tells her to return to her household duties, as war is the sphere of men. Andromache departs, mourning Hector as if dead.

Paris, now armed, joins Hector. Hector tells Paris that his deeds must wipe away the shame. They return to the battle, breathing vengeance.

**Book VII: The Single Combat of Hector and Ajax**
Hector and Paris rejoin the battle. Paris kills Menestheus, and Hector kills Eioneus. Glaucus kills Iphinous. Minerva, concerned for the Greeks, descends from Olympus. Apollo, seeing her, meets her near the Scaean Gate. They agree to halt the general engagement for the day and incite Hector to challenge a Greek champion to single combat.

Helenus, divining the gods' will, tells Hector to issue the challenge. Hector does so, proposing that the victor take the loser's arms, but the body be returned for burial. He suggests a monument for the fallen, ensuring lasting fame. The Greeks are astonished and fearful. Menelaus, shamed by their hesitation, offers to fight himself, but Agamemnon restrains him, reminding him of Hector's might. Nestor laments the lack of courage among the Greeks and recalls his own youthful prowess against Ereuthalion. Nine Greek chiefs rise to accept the challenge: Agamemnon, Diomed, Ajax Telamon, Ajax Oïleus, Idomeneus, Merion, Eurypylus, Thoas, and Ulysses.

Lots are cast from Agamemnon's helmet, and it falls upon Ajax Telamon. Ajax, overjoyed, declares his readiness to fight, asserting his strength and birth from Salamis. Both armies pray to Jove. Ajax arms himself in shining armor, bearing his massive seven-layered shield. He advances, tremendous as a god, causing Troy to tremble. Hector, though dauntless, pauses. Ajax defies Hector, reminding him that Achilles is absent, but Greece still has many brave warriors. Hector replies that he is prepared for combat and will not steal a conquest, implying an open, fair fight.

They throw their spears. Hector's spear strikes Ajax's shield but does not pierce. Ajax's spear pierces Hector's shield, corslet, and garment, but Hector shrinks back, avoiding a fatal wound. They draw their swords and close in. Hector's lance strikes Ajax's buckler, bending. Ajax drives his spear into Hector's neck, drawing blood. Hector, though wounded, seizes a massive stone and hurls it at Ajax's shield. Ajax responds with an even larger stone, striking Hector's buckler and numbing his knees, causing him to fall. Apollo restores Hector's strength. They draw their swords again, but heralds Talthybius and Idæus intervene, stopping the duel due to approaching night, as commanded by the gods.

Ajax agrees, stating Hector initiated the challenge. Hector acknowledges Ajax's worth and agrees to cease, suggesting they exchange gifts as a sign that their conflict is of glory, not hate. Hector gives Ajax a silver-studded sword; Ajax gives Hector a purple belt. They return to their respective armies.

The Trojans joyfully greet Hector. The Greeks lead Ajax to Agamemnon, who sacrifices a steer. Nestor then advises the Greeks to burn their dead and build a fortified wall with towers and a ditch around their camp and ships for future defense.

Meanwhile, the Trojan council debates. Antenor proposes returning Helen and her treasures to the Greeks to end the war. Paris refuses to give up Helen but offers to return the treasures and add more from his own store. Priam accepts Paris's offer and proposes a truce to bury the dead.

The next morning, Idæus goes to the Greek camp, relays Paris's offer, and requests a truce for burials. Diomed rejects the offer of treasures and Helen, declaring Troy is destined to fall. Agamemnon agrees only to the truce for burning the dead. Both sides collect and burn their fallen heroes.

The Greeks, following Nestor's advice, build a wall, towers, and a deep trench with palisades around their camp and fleet. Neptune is angered that the Greeks built such a fortification without consulting the gods or offering sacrifices, threatening to destroy it. Jupiter reassures Neptune that he can easily level the wall after the war. Both armies feast through the night, but Jupiter disheartens the Trojans with thunder and other signs of wrath. The Trojans stay awake, kindling fires in the field, waiting for dawn.

**Book VIII: The Second Battle, and the Distress of the Greeks**
At dawn, Jove convenes the gods, forbidding any to aid either side, threatening severe punishment in Tartarus for defiance. Minerva obtains permission to offer counsel to the Greeks. Jove then goes to Mount Ida, from where he observes the battle.

The armies clash, and for a while, the battle is equal. But when the sun reaches its height, Jove weighs the fates of Greece and Troy in golden scales; the Greek scale sinks, and the Trojan rises. Jove then unleashes thunder and lightning, terrifying the Greeks. All but Nestor retreat. Paris's dart wounds Nestor's horse, endangering him. Diomed rushes to rescue Nestor, calling to Ulysses who is fleeing towards the ships. Diomed and Nestor, in Diomed's chariot, confront Hector. Diomed's spear misses Hector but kills Eniopeus, Hector's charioteer. Hector, grieving, replaces Eniopeus with Archeptolemus.

Jove then hurls lightning at Diomed's chariot, causing the horses to fall and Nestor to drop the reins. Nestor advises Diomed to retreat, as Jove clearly favors Hector. Diomed reluctantly agrees, but curses the idea of Hector boasting of his flight. Hector insults Diomed as he flees. Hector then rallies his troops, promising them victory and the destruction of the Greek fleet by fire. He calls upon his horses, Xanthos, Aethon, Lampus, and Podargus, promising them rich rewards for helping him seize Nestor's golden shield and Diomed's Vulcanian armor.

Juno is angered by Jove's partiality and attempts to incite Neptune to defy Jove, but Neptune refuses to oppose the highest god. Hector drives the Trojans towards the Greek fortifications. Agamemnon, distressed, rallies his troops from Ulysses's ship, calling for Jove's aid. Jove sends an eagle as an omen, dropping a fawn near his altar, which encourages the Greeks.

Diomed, spurred by the omen, charges first, breaking through the ditch and slaying Agelaus. Other Greek heroes follow: the Atridae, the Ajaces, Meriones, Idomeneus, Evaemon's son, and Teucer. Teucer, protected by Ajax's shield, shoots arrows, killing Orsilochus, Ormenus, Lycophon, Chromius, Daetor, Ophelestes, Hamopaon, and Melanippus. Agamemnon praises Teucer and promises him rich rewards if Troy falls. Teucer attempts to shoot Hector, but Jove deflects his arrow. Another arrow kills Gorgythio, Priam's son. Teucer's third arrow is deflected by Apollo, but kills Archeptolemus, Hector's new charioteer. Hector, enraged, picks up a stone and hurls it at Teucer, breaking his bowstring and disabling his hand. Ajax then shields Teucer, and Alaster and Mecistheus carry him away.

Jove inspires the Trojans, who push the Greeks back behind their wall and into the trench. Hector, like a Gorgon, leads the charge. Juno and Minerva again prepare to intervene, but Jove, seeing their intent, sends Iris to warn them, threatening them with lightning and ten years of painful imprisonment if they defy him. Juno and Pallas, abashed, return to Olympus. Jove then returns from Ida to Olympus, where he sternly rebukes the goddesses. Juno complains about Jove's unwavering hate for Greece, but Jove reiterates his decree: Hector will continue to conquer until Achilles rises to avenge Patroclus, after which Hector himself will die, and Troy will fall.

As night falls, the Trojans, having driven the Greeks to their ships, celebrate their victory. Hector holds a council on Scamander's bank, ordering his troops to stay in the field, forage, light numerous fires to prevent Greek escape by night, and guard the walls of Troy. He vows to crush the Greeks in the morning. The Trojans feast and light a thousand fires across the plain, waiting for dawn.

**Book IX: The Embassy to Achilles**
The Greeks spend the night in despair. Agamemnon, greatly distressed, calls a council of the peers in his tent. He weeps and proposes giving up the siege and returning to Greece, lamenting Jove's broken promises of victory. Diomed defiantly opposes this, stating he will stay and fight even if all others flee. Nestor praises Diomed's spirit and advises Agamemnon to secure the guards and then convene the elders for counsel.

Agamemnon follows Nestor's advice. After a feast, Nestor again speaks, urging reconciliation with Achilles. He reminds Agamemnon that he opposed the seizure of Briseïs. Agamemnon admits his fault and offers immense gifts to Achilles: ten talents of gold, twenty shining vases, seven unused tripods, twelve victorious horses, seven beautiful Lesbian captives (including Briseïs, whom he swears he never touched), and promises twenty more Trojan captives and vast spoils if Troy falls. He further offers Achilles one of his three daughters in marriage without a dowry, granting him seven rich cities to rule. He pleads with Achilles to relent, comparing him to Hades in his unforgiving nature.

Nestor suggests an embassy of chosen delegates: Phoenix, Great Ajax, and Ulysses. Hodius and Eurybates are to accompany them. After libations to Jove, the envoys set out, praying to Neptune for success. They find Achilles playing the harp in his tent, with Patroclus listening. Achilles welcomes them warmly, despite their being Greeks.

After a feast, Ulysses presents Agamemnon's offer, reminding Achilles of his father Peleus's advice to control his temper and seek gentler glory. He lists all the offered gifts and cities, stressing Greece's desperate situation, with Hector threatening to burn the ships. Achilles replies with fierce disdain, stating he detests those who say one thing and mean another. He refuses Agamemnon's gifts and reconciliation, recounting his past efforts for the Greeks and how Agamemnon unjustly seized his prize, Briseïs. He declares his intention to return home to Phthia, sailing at dawn, and advises the Greeks to do the same. He dismisses Agamemnon's fortifications as weak and reminds them of Hector's past fear of him. He will only fight if Hector reaches his own ships. He permits Phoenix to stay or leave as he wishes.

Phoenix, weeping, recounts his own past (exile from his father for trying to prevent his father from marrying his mistress, being taken in by Peleus, and raising Achilles) and appeals to Achilles's sense of duty and compassion. He tells the story of Meleager, who refused to fight for Calydon out of anger until his wife persuaded him, only to receive no rewards for his late service. Phoenix urges Achilles not to wait until the ships burn to act. Achilles rejects Phoenix's appeal to pity and anger.

Ajax then speaks, urging Achilles to consider the honor of his comrades and the value of the gifts. He points out that even for a murdered brother, men accept atonement. Achilles replies that Ajax has spoken well, but his rage rekindles at Agamemnon's name, as he feels disgraced. He repeats that he will not fight until Hector's flames threaten his own ships. The embassy returns unsuccessfully to the camp. Patroclus prepares a bed for Phoenix, and Achilles sleeps with Diomede (a captive), while Patroclus sleeps with Iphis (another captive).

Ulysses reports Achilles's harsh refusal to Agamemnon. Diomed, undaunted, counsels the Greeks to refresh themselves and then prepare for battle at dawn, without Achilles. The Greeks agree and retire to sleep.

**Book X: The Night-Adventure of Diomed and Ulysses**
Agamemnon, unable to sleep due to anxiety, rises and puts on his armor. He seeks Nestor, equally sleepless, to consult. Menelaus, also awake and armored, meets Agamemnon, and they decide to wake other chiefs. Agamemnon goes to Nestor, finding him also awake and armored. Nestor advises waking Ulysses and Diomed. Agamemnon agrees, then Menelaus goes to wake Ajax and Idomeneus, while Nestor goes for Ulysses and Diomed.

Nestor finds Diomed armored and his companions asleep. He wakes Diomed, who questions why Nestor is undertaking such tasks at his age. Nestor explains the dire need for every Greek to contribute. They proceed to the night guards. Nestor praises the guards' vigilance. The assembled chiefs, including Nestor's son Thrasymedes and Merion, hold a council near the trench.

Nestor proposes sending a spy into the Trojan camp to gather intelligence. He offers rich rewards: a chariot, horses, a ewe, a lamb, and a place of honor at feasts. Diomed volunteers for the dangerous task, requesting a companion. Several chiefs volunteer, but Agamemnon urges Diomed to choose wisely without bias. Diomed chooses Ulysses, praising his wisdom and Pallas's protection. Ulysses, after a modest reply, notes the fading stars, indicating limited time.

Diomed receives a two-edged falchion and a helm without a crest from Thrasymedes. Ulysses takes a sword, a bow, a quiver of arrows, and a helmet made of a boar's teeth from Merion. Pallas sends a heron as a good omen. Both heroes pray to Pallas for success.

Meanwhile, Hector holds a council in the Trojan camp near Ilus's monument, also proposing to send a spy to the Greek fleet. He offers the best Greek chariot and horses (Achilles's, he hopes) as a reward. Dolon, Eumedes's son, a swift but not handsome youth, volunteers, demanding Achilles's immortal horses and chariot. Hector swears by Jove that no one else shall have them. Dolon, dressed in a wolf's hide and a ferret-fur helmet, with a javelin, sets out.

Diomed and Ulysses spot Dolon. They let him pass some distance, then pursue him. Dolon, thinking Hector is calling him, stops, only to realize he is pursued by enemies. He flees towards the ships but is cut off by the Greeks. Diomed throws his spear, which deliberately misses him, fixing in the ground. Dolon freezes in terror. They capture him, and he begs for his life, offering a ransom. Ulysses interrogates him. Dolon reveals Hector's plan to burn the ships at dawn, describes the Trojan camp's layout (Trojan guards are vigilant, auxiliaries sleep more soundly), and details the recently arrived Thracian contingent led by King Rhesus, known for his magnificent white horses and golden armor.

Diomed, after hearing the information, kills Dolon, stating a traitor should not live to betray again. They strip his wolf-hide helmet, bow, and javelin, which Ulysses dedicates to Pallas. They then mark the spot with reeds and boughs.

The two heroes proceed to the Thracian camp. Ulysses points out Rhesus, his white horses, and golden armor. Diomed, inspired by Pallas, slaughters twelve Thracian soldiers and Rhesus himself in his sleep. Pallas sends a dream vision to Rhesus, causing his death. Ulysses, clearing the path of bodies, leads Rhesus's horses away. Pallas warns Diomed to return, as Apollo is growing angry. They return with the horses and Dolon's spoils.

Nestor hears the approaching horses and hopes for their success. Diomed and Ulysses return to the Greek camp. Nestor asks about the horses, and Ulysses recounts their exploit. They lead the Thracian horses to Diomed's stalls. They cleanse themselves in the sea, refresh in the bath, and then feast, pouring libations to Pallas for her divine aid.

**Book XI: The Third Battle, and the Acts of Agamemnon**
At dawn, Jove sends Eris (Discord) to incite the Greeks. She shouts through the camp, filling the heroes with martial ardor. Agamemnon, splendidly armed in divine armor (including a cuirass gifted by King Cinyras, a shield with a Gorgon, and a four-plumed helmet), leads the Greeks. Jove, unwilling to witness the slaughter, makes it rain blood.

The Trojans, led by Hector, Polydamas, Æneas, and others, advance from Ilus's tomb. The battle rages fiercely, with equal slaughter on both sides. Agamemnon performs heroically, killing Bienor and his squire, then two sons of Priam (Isus and Antiphus), whom Achilles had once captured and ransomed. He also kills the sons of Antimachus, who had previously advocated killing Ulysses and Menelaus. Agamemnon rejects their pleas for ransom and slaughters them. He continues his rampage, routing the Trojans and creating a path of destruction.

Hector would have died, but Jove protects him. Jove then sends Iris to Hector, commanding him to retreat while Agamemnon is still fighting, but to rejoin the battle fiercely once Agamemnon is wounded and withdraws. Iris delivers the message. Hector, obedient, springs from his chariot and rallies his troops, while Agamemnon continues his slaughter, killing Iphidamas (Antenor's son) and then Coön, Antenor's eldest son, who had wounded Agamemnon in the arm while trying to rescue his brother. Agamemnon, despite his wound, kills Coön and strips their arms.

Agamemnon, suffering greatly from his wound, mounts his chariot and retires to his tent, exhorting his troops to continue the fight. As Agamemnon leaves, Hector, recalling Jove's command, charges the Greeks with renewed fury. He slaughters many Greeks, including Assaeus, Dolops, and Autonous. The Greeks would have been overwhelmed, but Ulysses and Diomed make a stand, rallying their forces. They kill the sons of Merops and then Hypirochus and Hippodamus. Diomed slays Agastrophus.

Hector spots Diomed and charges him. Diomed hurls his spear, striking Hector's helmet but failing to pierce it (it was a gift from Apollo). Hector, stunned, recovers and retreats. Diomed boasts, but Paris, from a distance, shoots an arrow that pierces Diomed's foot. Paris boasts of his hit, but Diomed dismisses it as a coward's wound, predicting Paris's own death. Ulysses removes the arrow, and Diomed retreats to his ship.

Ulysses is left alone, surrounded by Trojans. He debates whether to flee or fight, choosing to stand his ground. He kills several Trojans, including Deiopis, Ennomus, Thoon, Chersidamas, Charops, and Socus, who wounds Ulysses before being killed. Ulysses, wounded and under immense pressure, shouts for help. Menelaus hears his cry and calls Ajax to assist. Ajax and Menelaus reach Ulysses, scattering the Trojans. They carry Ulysses back to his chariot. Ajax continues to fight, killing Doryclus and Pandocus.

Hector, unaware of the fight over Ulysses, rages on the left wing. Nestor and Idomeneus oppose him. Paris wounds Machaon, a physician, with an arrow in the shoulder. Idomeneus tells Nestor to take Machaon to the ships for healing, recognizing his value to the army. Nestor carries Machaon in his chariot to the fleet.

Cebriones, Hector's charioteer, observes the Greek rally led by Ajax and urges Hector to fight there. Hector drives his chariot towards Ajax, slaughtering many. Jove fills Ajax with dread, and he slowly retreats, forced back by the overwhelming Trojan numbers and divine intervention. Eurypylus aids Ajax, killing Apisaon. Paris wounds Eurypylus with an arrow in the thigh. Eurypylus, wounded, calls for Greek aid, which arrives to protect him.

Nestor's chariot, bearing Machaon, is seen by Achilles from his ship. He sends Patroclus to inquire who the wounded Greek is, sensing impending doom. Patroclus goes to Nestor's tent, where Nestor is attending to Machaon. Patroclus asks about the wounded. Nestor recounts the dire situation: many chiefs (Ulysses, Agamemnon, Diomed, Eurypylus) are wounded, and Achilles's inaction is costing Greece dearly. He recounts his own youthful exploits and then reminds Patroclus of the advice Peleus and Menoetius gave them about humility and aiding friends. He urges Patroclus to persuade Achilles to fight or, if not, to lead the Myrmidons himself, clad in Achilles's armor, to inspire the Greeks and repel the Trojans from the ships.

Patroclus, moved, leaves for Achilles's tent but encounters Eurypylus, also wounded, struggling back to the ships. Eurypylus tells Patroclus that Greece is lost and asks him to extract the arrow and apply healing balms, taught by Chiron to Achilles. Patroclus agrees, takes Eurypylus to his tent, cuts out the dart, and applies a bitter root, which staunches the bleeding and eases the pain.

**Book XII: The Battle at the Grecian Wall**
While Patroclus attends to Eurypylus, the battle intensifies around the Greek fortifications. The text explains that these walls, built without offerings to the gods, were destined for destruction after the war by Neptune and Apollo, who would deluge them and level them with the sea.

For now, the wall stands. Hector, like a wild boar, drives the Trojans to attack it. The Trojan chariots are unable to cross the deep trench, which is bristling with sharpened stakes. Polydamas advises Hector to abandon the chariots and attack on foot, dividing their army into five battalions. Hector agrees and his men follow suit, leaving their chariots behind.

Asius, however, disobeys and attempts to drive his chariot through a gate where the Greeks are fleeing to their ships. He and his men are met by two brave Lapith chiefs, Polypœtes and Leonteus, who defend the gate fiercely. Asius, despite his courage, is unable to break through and is frustrated. He accuses Jove of deceiving them.

The battle rages at all the gates. Polypœtes kills Damasus, and Leonteus kills Hippomachus, Antiphates, Iamenus, Orestes, and Menon. Meanwhile, a bad omen appears for the Trojans: an eagle with a bleeding serpent in its talons, which it drops among the troops. Polydamas interprets this as a sign that they will breach the wall but fail to take the ships and will suffer heavily in retreat. He advises Hector to reconsider.

Hector furiously rejects Polydamas's counsel, stating he trusts Jove's earlier promise of victory, not omens from birds. He declares that the only omen needed is to fight for one's country. He threatens to kill anyone who disobeys. He then rallies his troops. Jove sends a whirlwind that raises dust, dismays the Greeks, and aids Hector. The Trojans, with Jove's help, begin to undermine and pull down the Greek wall. The Ajaces heroically defend the ramparts, encouraging their men.

Sarpedon, inspired by Jove, shines in his armor and leads his Lycian forces against a section of the wall near Menestheus. He gives an inspiring speech to Glaucus, stating that their privileged position requires them to fight bravely, reminding him of their mortality and the need to gain glory. Menestheus, seeing the threat, sends Thoas to summon the Ajaces and Teucer for aid. Ajax Telamon responds, leaving Lycomede and Oïleus to defend their post.

Ajax slays Epicles, Sarpedon's friend, by hurling a massive stone, crushing his helmet. Glaucus is wounded in the arm by Teucer's arrow but conceals his wound and retreats. Sarpedon, seeing Glaucus leave, charges more fiercely, killing Alcmaon. He then pulls at the battlement, causing the stones to yield and a breach to appear. Teucer shoots an arrow at Sarpedon, piercing his belt but not fatally wounding him. Sarpedon retreats briefly but then rallies his Lycians to exploit the breach. The battle becomes a stalemate, with neither side gaining ground.

Finally, Hector, with Jove's aid, seizes a massive stone (too heavy for two men of later ages) and hurls it at the center of the wooden gates. The gates shatter, and Hector bursts through, his eyes flashing fire, appearing like a god. The Trojans pour through the breach, and the Greeks, terrified, flee to their ships. The shore is covered with death, and chaos fills the air.

**Book XIII: The Fourth Battle Continued, in which Neptune Assists the Greeks**
Jupiter, having seen Hector successfully breach the wall and drive the Greeks to their ships, turns his attention away to the Thracians, Mysians, and Hippomolgians, leaving the Trojans and Greeks to their own fates.

Neptune, observing Jove's partiality and the Greek distress from Samothracia, is enraged. He descends swiftly, causing the earth to tremble, and reaches his underwater palace. He harnesses his sea-horses and drives his chariot across the waves, the sea parting before him. He stops his chariot in a cave between Tenedos and Imbrus, feeds his horses ambrosial food, and binds them.

Neptune then approaches the Greek lines, disguised as Calchas, the prophet. He encourages the Ajaces, inspiring them with renewed strength and urging them to defend the ships, as Hector is raging like fire. He then inspires other Greek chiefs, including Teucer, Leitus, Peneleus, Thoas, Deipyrus, Merion, and Nestor's son, with shame and courage, reminding them of their former glory and the consequences of defeat. He warns them that the gates are bursting and Hector is at the wall.

The Greeks, filled with divine ardor, form a dense phalanx, shield to shield, to resist Hector. Hector charges, but the Greeks stand firm. Deiphobus throws a spear at Merion, but it breaks on his shield. Teucer kills Imbrius, and Hector throws a javelin at Teucer, missing him but killing Amphimachus, a grandson of Neptune. Ajax Telamon kills Hippothous. Neptune is deeply grieved by his grandson's death and further inspires the Greeks.

Neptune, still disguised, finds Idomeneus and spurs him to fight. Idomeneus arms himself with two javelins and rushes to battle like lightning. Merion joins him. They discuss where to fight, deciding on the left wing where the battle is fierce.

The battle rages. Idomeneus kills Othryoneus, who had sought Cassandra's hand in marriage. He then kills Asius, who had driven his chariot through the gate. Deiphobus is enraged by Asius's death and throws a spear at Idomeneus, who dodges it. The spear instead kills Hypsenor. Deiphobus boasts, further provoking Idomeneus, who kills Alcathous, Anchises' son-in-law. Idomeneus then boasts about his divine lineage (descended from Jove). Deiphobus seeks Æneas's aid, finding him angry with Priam for favoring others. Æneas is moved by his brother-in-law's death and rushes to fight Idomeneus.

Idomeneus calls for his comrades, Antilochus, Deipyrus, Merion, and Aphareus, to join him against Æneas. Æneas is supported by Paris, Deiphobus, and Agenor. The battle intensifies around Alcathous's body. Idomeneus's spear misses Æneas and kills Oenomaus. Deiphobus wounds Ascalaphus, a son of Mars. Merion wounds Deiphobus, who is then carried away by Polites. Æneas kills Aphareus. Antilochus kills Thoon. Adamas, Asius's son, is wounded by Merion. Helenus wounds Deipyrus. Menelaus wounds Helenus with a spear in the hand and then kills Pisander.

Paris kills Harpalion, a Paphlagonian ally. Menelaus slays Harpalion. Paris, seeing his friend killed, shoots an arrow, killing Euchenor.

Hector continues to fight in the center, where the wall was breached. The Locrian archers, without heavy armor, harass the Trojans with arrows and stones from a distance, supporting the heavily armored Ajaces. Polydamas again advises Hector to call a council and reconsider their strategy, fearing Achilles's eventual return. Hector, though initially angry, accepts this advice and goes to rally the other Trojan leaders. He rebukes Paris for his inaction. Paris explains that he was fighting and that some chiefs are wounded. Hector, his anger assuaged, returns to the front. He and Ajax exchange challenges, and the battle continues to rage.

**Book XIV: Juno Deceives Jupiter by the Girdle of Venus**
Nestor, hearing the increasing clamor of war, leaves Machaon to heal and goes to explore the situation. He sees the Greeks in disarray, the wall in ruins, and the Trojans advancing. He encounters Agamemnon, Ulysses, and Diomed, all wounded and supporting themselves with spears. Nestor describes the dire situation. Agamemnon, in despair, proposes abandoning the siege and sailing home under the cover of night.

Ulysses vehemently rejects this, calling it shameful and cowardly, and reminds Agamemnon of his duty. Agamemnon accepts Ulysses's rebuke. Diomed then advises that even though they are wounded, they should go forth and encourage the army with their presence, remaining outside javelin range. The wounded kings follow his advice. As they move, Neptune appears, disguised as an old warrior, and encourages Agamemnon, promising that Achilles will eventually perish and Jove will soon favor the Greeks. He then rushes into the battle, inspiring the Greek troops.

Juno, seeing Neptune aiding the Greeks and Jove watching from Ida, devises a plan to deceive Jove. She enhances her beauty, anoints herself with fragrant oils, braids her hair, dons a magnificent mantle, golden zone, and earrings. She then visits Venus, asking for her magic girdle (cestus) to reconcile Ocean and Tethys, the ancient parents of the gods, who are estranged. Venus, despite her partiality to Troy, grants the request.

Juno then goes to Sleep, asking him to put Jove to sleep. Sleep is reluctant, recalling Jove's past wrath when he put him to sleep for Juno's benefit, allowing Hercules to be shipwrecked. Juno promises Sleep Pasithaë, the youngest of the Graces, as his wife. Sleep demands an oath by Styx and the Titans, which Juno provides.

Juno and Sleep fly to Ida. Sleep hides in a fir tree, disguised as a bird. Juno presents herself to Jove. Jove is immediately captivated by her beauty and strong desire. He recounts his past loves but states his passion for Juno now surpasses them all. Juno feigns modesty and suggests they retire to his bower, but Jove insists on making love on Ida, creating a golden cloud to conceal them. Earth responds by producing a bed of flowers. Jove, overcome by love and sleep, falls into a deep slumber.

Sleep immediately goes to Neptune, informing him that Jove is asleep, thus allowing Neptune to aid the Greeks freely. Neptune, filled with zeal, rallies the Greeks, urging them to fight with their strongest shields and spears. The Greeks eagerly comply.

Neptune and Hector meet in battle. Hector throws his javelin at Ajax, which strikes his belt but doesn't penetrate. Ajax then hurls a huge stone, striking Hector in the breast and throat, causing him to fall unconscious. Polydamas, Æneas, and other Trojan leaders carry the groaning Hector from the field to his chariot, taking him towards Troy. On the mead by Xanthus, they sprinkle him with water. Hector revives, but is faint and half-conscious.

With Hector removed, the Greeks, led by Ajax Oïleus, push back the Trojans. Polydamas kills Prothoënor, but Ajax Telamon kills Archilochus in revenge. Acamas kills Promachus, who was defending Archilochus's body. Peneleus kills Ilioneus. Great Ajax, Oïleus's son, excels in pursuit, slaughtering many Trojans.

**Book XV: The Fifth Battle at the Ships; and the Acts of Ajax**
The Trojans, driven back across the trench, are terrified. Jove, waking on Ida's summit, sees the Trojan rout, the Greeks advancing, Neptune leading them, and Hector faint and bleeding. Enraged, he rebukes Juno for her deceit, reminding her of her past punishment for aiding Hercules. Juno, trembling, denies direct involvement, blaming Neptune's own pity and ardor for the Greeks.

Jove, smiling, accepts her explanation and reveals his unalterable plan: Neptune must withdraw, Apollo will revive Hector and empower him to drive the Greeks back to Achilles's ships. Patroclus will then be sent to battle in Achilles's armor, kill many, including Jove's own son Sarpedon, but then Patroclus himself will die by Hector's hand. Only then will Achilles rise, and Troy will eventually fall.

Juno flies to Olympus, informing the gods of Jove's decree. Mars, angered by the death of his son Ascalaphus, prepares to fight Jove, but Pallas intervenes, dissuading him and reminding him of Jove's power. Juno then sends Iris and Apollo to Jove on Ida to receive his orders.

Iris descends to Neptune, ordering him, on Jove's behalf, to withdraw from the battle. Neptune initially resists, asserting his equality with Jove as a son of Saturn and stating his domain. Iris warns him of Jove's immense wrath. Neptune reluctantly yields, though still angry at Jove's partiality to Troy, and plunges into the sea.

Jove then sends Apollo to Hector. Apollo finds Hector by the Scamander, his senses returning. Apollo inspires Hector, gives him renewed vigor, and commands him to lead the Trojans back to battle, promising to clear the way and aid him. Hector, filled with divine strength, rushes back. The Greeks, seeing Hector restored, are dismayed. Thoas advises a defensive formation by the ships.

Apollo, bearing Jove's ægis, leads the Trojans, shining it to terrify the Greeks. The Greeks are seized with panic and flee. Hector leads the slaughter, killing Arcesilas, Stichius, Medon, Iasus, Mecystes, Clonius, and Deiochus. The Greeks are driven back to their trench and wall. Apollo then easily pushes down the Greek wall and fills the ditch, creating a wide path for the Trojans to cross.

The Trojans pour through, pushing towards the Greek ships. Nestor prays to Jove to save the fleet. Jove thunders, affirming his support for the Trojans. The Trojans surge over the Greek ships.

Patroclus, still tending to Eurypylus, sees the flames approaching the fleet. He cries out in distress, tells Eurypylus he must go, and rushes back to Achilles to urge him to action.

The Greeks fight desperately at the ships. Ajax the Greater and Hector meet in fierce combat over a ship. Clytius, attempting to set fire to a ship, is killed by Ajax. Hector, seeing Clytius fall, throws his javelin at Ajax, who dodges it. The spear kills Lycophron, Ajax's faithful servant. Ajax, enraged, calls on Teucer to avenge their friend. Teucer shoots arrows, killing Clytus. Polydamas retrieves Clytus's horses. Teucer aims at Hector again, but Jove breaks his bowstring. Ajax tells Teucer to take up a spear instead.

Hector, seeing Jove's favor, rallies his troops, urging them to reach the ships with flames. Ajax exhorts the Greeks to fight with courage, reminding them that their only defense is themselves, as their lands are far away. Hector's forces press on, and he himself seizes the stern of Protesilaus's ship. Ajax, though overwhelmed, stands firm at the stern, defending the ship. Hector calls for fire. Ajax, amidst the storm of darts and flames, continues to fight heroically, killing twelve Trojans who attempt to fire the ships.

**Book XVI: The Sixth Battle, the Acts and Death of Patroclus**
As the battle rages at the ships, Patroclus, weeping, approaches Achilles. Achilles asks him the cause of his tears. Patroclus passionately pleads with Achilles to re-enter the fight or, failing that, to allow him to lead the Myrmidons, clad in Achilles's armor, to save the Greek fleet. He emphasizes the dire state of the wounded Greek chiefs and Achilles's ""unforgiving mind.""

Achilles, with a heavy sigh, states that his anger is rooted in Agamemnon's pride and the seizure of Briseïs. He agrees to let Patroclus lead his Myrmidons into battle, wearing his armor. However, he strictly commands Patroclus to only repel the Trojans from the ships and not to pursue them to Troy's walls, warning of divine intervention if he oversteps. He expresses a wish that all Trojans and Greeks but themselves might perish, so they alone could conquer Troy.

Meanwhile, Ajax is overwhelmed by the Trojan assault and is forced to retreat from Protesilaus's ship, which Hector then sets on fire. Achilles sees the flames, strikes his thigh, and immediately urges Patroclus to arm and save the ships.

Patroclus dons Achilles's greaves, cuirass, sword, shield, and helmet. He takes up all of Achilles's arms except the mighty Pelian ash spear, which only Achilles can wield. Automedon harnesses Achilles's immortal horses, Xanthus and Balius (offspring of the wind-harpy Podarge and Zephyr), and the mortal horse Pedasus. Achilles rallies his Myrmidons, reminding them of their previous complaints about his inaction and urging them to fight fiercely.

Achilles then performs a libation to Jove from a sacred cup, praying for Patroclus to save the fleet and return safely, but also for Patroclus to distinguish himself in battle. Jove grants the first part of the prayer (saving the fleet) but denies the second (safe return). Achilles returns to his tent to watch the battle.

Patroclus leads the Myrmidons into battle. The Trojans, seeing Achilles's armor, believe Achilles has returned and are seized with panic, fleeing from the ships. Patroclus's spear kills Pyrechmes, the Paeonian leader. Patroclus extinguishes the fires on the half-burnt ship, and the Greeks reclaim their decks.

Patroclus then pursues the fleeing Trojans, slaughtering many. He kills Areilycus, Thoas, Amphidus, Atymnius, Maris (Sarpedon's friends), Cleobulus, Lycon, Neamas, and Erymas. He presses the rout towards Troy. Hector is forced to retreat in his chariot, his Trojans falling into the trench and being crushed. Patroclus continues the relentless pursuit, driving the Trojans back towards the city.

He slays Pronous, Thestor (who falls from his chariot, impaled by Patroclus's spear), Eryalus (killed by a stone), Epaltes, Echius, Ipheas, Evippus, Polymelus, Amphoterus, Erymas, Tlepolemus, and Pyres.

Sarpedon, seeing his Lycians fall, leaps from his car and challenges Patroclus. Jove, foreseeing Sarpedon's death, debates whether to save him but is dissuaded by Juno, who reminds him of the fate of other divine offspring and the need for consistency. Jove weeps tears of blood for his son.

Patroclus's spear kills Thrasymed. Sarpedon throws two darts; one misses, the other kills Pedasus, Achilles's mortal horse. Automedon cuts the harness to free the remaining immortal horses. Sarpedon then throws his spear, missing Patroclus. Patroclus's spear, however, pierces Sarpedon's breast, killing him. Sarpedon, dying, calls to Glaucus to defend his body and not allow the Greeks to strip his arms. Patroclus stands over Sarpedon's body.

Glaucus, still wounded from Teucer's arrow, prays to Apollo for strength. Apollo heals him and inspires him to rally the Trojans and Lycians to fight for Sarpedon's body. Hector is grief-stricken and leads the charge. Patroclus rallies the Greeks, including Ajax, to defend the body and strip Sarpedon's arms. Jove covers the battle with a dark cloud, intensifying the fight.

Epigeus is killed by Hector. Patroclus kills Sthenelaus. Glaucus kills Bathyclaeus. Merion kills Laogonus. Æneas throws a spear at Merion, who dodges. Merion retorts that success comes from heaven. Patroclus chides Merion for boasting, urging action.

The battle rages over Sarpedon's body. Jove determines that Patroclus will kill many, but not capture Troy. He fills Hector with dismay, causing him to retreat. The Lycians flee, leaving Sarpedon's body. The Greeks obtain the body, and Patroclus strips Sarpedon's radiant armor.

Jove commands Apollo to rescue Sarpedon's body from the battlefield, clean it, anoint it, and have Sleep and Death carry it to Lycia for burial. Apollo obeys.

Patroclus, disregarding Achilles's command, furiously pursues the Trojans towards the walls of Troy. He kills Adrestus, Autonous, Echeclus, Megas, Epistor, Melanippus, Elasus, Mulius, and Pylartes. He attempts to scale the wall three times, but Apollo repulses him each time. Apollo, disguised as Asius, encourages Hector to fight Patroclus.

Hector orders Cebrion to drive his chariot towards Patroclus. Patroclus kills Cebrion with a stone to the head. Hector and Patroclus fight over Cebrion's body. Jove sends darkness over the battle. As the sun sets, the Greeks gain ground, drawing Cebrion's body away.

Patroclus, with renewed fury, charges the Trojans thrice, killing three heroes with each charge. But on his fourth charge, Apollo, shrouded in a dusky cloud, strikes Patroclus from behind, disorienting him, causing his helmet to fall, and breaking his spear. His shield drops, and his corslet loosens. Euphorbus, a Dardan youth, then wounds Patroclus with a spear in the back but flees back into the crowd. Hector, seeing Patroclus disarmed and wounded, pierces him with his lance, inflicting a mortal wound.

As Patroclus lies dying, Hector boasts of his victory. Patroclus, with his last breath, prophesies Hector's own imminent death at the hands of Achilles, stating that Apollo and Euphorbus disarmed him, and Hector merely delivered the final blow. Patroclus dies, his soul flying to Hades. Hector, questioning Patroclus's prophecy, extracts his spear, and charges Automedon, Achilles's charioteer, who flees in the immortal horses.

**Book XVII: The Seventh Battle, for the Body of Patroclus**
Patroclus's body lies dead on the plain. Menelaus immediately springs to defend the body, like a heifer protecting her young. Euphorbus, who wounded Patroclus, challenges Menelaus for the spoils, asserting his right. Menelaus mocks Euphorbus's boasts, recalling how he killed Euphorbus's brother. Euphorbus then throws his spear, which strikes Menelaus's shield but does not pierce. Menelaus's spear pierces Euphorbus's throat, killing him. Menelaus strips Euphorbus's golden armor.

Apollo, disguised as Mentes, incites Hector to abandon his pursuit of Achilles's horses and instead fight for Patroclus's body and Euphorbus's armor, which Menelaus is stripping. Hector, seeing Euphorbus dead and Menelaus taking his arms, rushes back. Menelaus, seeing Hector and his forces, considers whether to flee or fight. He decides to retreat, recognizing the overwhelming force and Jove's favor towards Hector. He calls on Ajax for help and slowly withdraws from the body.

Hector strips Achilles's armor from Patroclus's body and sends it to Troy to be a trophy. Ajax Telamon arrives and shields Patroclus's body. Menelaus returns to stand beside Ajax. Glaucus rebukes Hector for his flight from Ajax and his failure to protect Sarpedon's body. He challenges Hector to prove his bravery and regain Patroclus's body. Hector, stung, asserts his bravery and declares he will now fight for Patroclus's body, promising that if he wins, he will strip the armor (Achilles's own, which Patroclus wore).

Hector dons Achilles's armor (stripped from Patroclus). Jove sees him and pities him, knowing this glory is short-lived, as Hector is destined to die by Achilles's hand. Jove gives Hector immense strength. Hector, shining in the divine armor, rallies the Trojans, promising equal honors to anyone who can drag Patroclus's body to Troy.

Ajax foresees their doom and calls on the bravest Greeks to defend Patroclus's body. Ajax Oïleus, Idomeneus, and Merion respond. The battle for Patroclus's body rages fiercely. Jove pours a thick darkness over the body, honoring Patroclus even in death.

The Trojans briefly gain ground, but Ajax Telamon rallies the Greeks and drives them back. Hippothous attempts to drag Patroclus by his ankles but is killed by Ajax's spear. Hector's javelin misses Ajax but kills Schedius. Phorcys is killed by Ajax. The Trojans are about to be routed.

Apollo, disguised as Periphas, encourages Æneas to rally the Trojans. Æneas confronts the Greeks, killing Leocritus and Apisaon. The Greeks form a bronze wall around Patroclus's body. Great Ajax commands them to hold firm. The battle continues under a thick darkness around Patroclus, while elsewhere the sun shines.

Achilles, from his ships, is still unaware of Patroclus's death, expecting him to return victorious. The conflict over Patroclus's body exhausts the warriors. Achilles's immortal horses weep for Patroclus, refusing to move for Automedon. Jove pities them and gives them renewed spirit, allowing Automedon to escape.

Alcimedon joins Automedon in the chariot, reminding him of Patroclus's death and Hector's possession of Achilles's armor. Automedon yields the reins to Alcimedon and prepares to fight on foot. Hector and Æneas, seeing Achilles's empty chariot, attempt to seize it. Automedon throws his javelin, killing Aretus. Hector and Æneas charge, but the Ajaces arrive to help Automedon. Hector and Æneas retreat.

Minerva, sent by Jove, descends and inspires Menelaus, who then kills Podes, Hector's friend. Jove shakes his ægis, causing the Greeks to flee. Peneleus is wounded by Polydamas, Leitus by Hector. Idomeneus throws a javelin at Hector, which breaks on his corslet. Hector's spear kills Coeranus, Merion's charioteer. Merion takes the reins and withdraws with Idomeneus.

Ajax realizes Jove is turning the tide for the Trojans. He prays to Jove to dispel the darkness so they can at least see their fate. Jove grants his prayer, restoring light. Ajax then tells Menelaus to send Antilochus to inform Achilles of Patroclus's death. Menelaus, though distressed, agrees. He warns the other Greeks to protect Patroclus's body while Antilochus delivers the message.

Menelaus then returns to the fight, urging Thrasymedes to help. Ajax and Menelaus, with Merion's help, lift Patroclus's body. The Trojans, led by Æneas and Hector, pursue relentlessly. Ajax, forming the rear guard, repels the Trojans, who retreat in fear whenever he turns. The Greeks, burdened by the body, slowly retreat towards the ships, leaving their scattered armor on the plain as Jove impresses horror upon them.

**Book XVIII: The Grief of Achilles, and New Armour Made Him by Vulcan**
The battle rages. Antilochus, Nestor's son, brings Achilles the news of Patroclus's death, his naked body fought over, and Hector wearing Achilles's armor. Achilles is overcome with horror and grief. He throws himself on the ground, covers himself in ashes, tears his hair, and grovels in the dust. His captive women rush from their tents, wailing. Antilochus holds Achilles's hands to prevent him from harming himself.

Thetis, deep in the ocean, hears Achilles's cries. She rises with her Nereid sisters, lamenting her son's fated short life and his current grief. She approaches Achilles and asks the cause of his sorrow. Achilles tells her Patroclus is dead, Hector wears his armor, and he cannot bear to live without avenging his friend. He accepts his own fated death after Hector's. He declares he will go to battle now, demanding his arms.

Thetis weeps, knowing Achilles's death will follow Hector's. She promises to bring him new, divine armor forged by Vulcan by the next dawn, as his own is lost. She then dismisses her Nereids and flies to Olympus.

Meanwhile, the Greeks are still being driven back towards the Hellespont, unable to bring Patroclus's body safely to the ships due to Hector's relentless assault. Hector repeatedly attempts to seize the body. Juno, observing the dire situation, sends Iris to Achilles, unseen by Jove. Iris urges Achilles, though unarmed, to show himself at the trench.

Achilles rises. Pallas throws her ægis over him and creates a golden cloud around his head, causing a stream of glory to flame. He stands high on the rampart and shouts three times. His voice, amplified by Minerva, terrifies the Trojans, who drop their arms, and their horses are thrown back. Twelve Trojans are crushed by their own chariots. The Greeks take advantage of the panic to carry Patroclus's body safely to Achilles's tent. Achilles weeps over his friend's body.

As the sun sets (by Juno's command), the battle ends. The Trojans, panting from the war, hold a hasty council. Polydamas advises retreating inside the city walls for safety, fearing Achilles's return to battle, and acknowledging the danger of camping on the exposed plain. Hector, however, enraged, rejects this counsel. He rebukes Polydamas for cowardice and asserts that Jove now favors them. He orders the Trojans to stay in the field, take refreshment, and prepare to attack the ships at dawn, declaring he will meet Achilles himself. Pallas inspires the Trojans to accept Hector's worst advice.

The Greeks mourn Patroclus through the night. Achilles, in deep grief, embraces Patroclus's cold body, lamenting his broken promise to Menoetius to return Patroclus safely. He vows to avenge him by killing Hector and sacrificing twelve Trojan captives on Patroclus's pyre. He orders his Myrmidons to clean Patroclus's body.

Thetis arrives at Vulcan's palace. She finds him working on twenty self-moving tripods. Charis, Vulcan's wife, welcomes Thetis. Vulcan recalls how Thetis rescued him when Juno threw him from Olympus. Thetis recounts her sorrows: forced to marry a mortal, her godlike son destined for an untimely death, and now his armor lost and his friend dead. She begs Vulcan to forge new, immortal arms for Achilles. Vulcan readily agrees, promising to make armor that will be the wonder of ages.

Vulcan begins his work, forging a magnificent shield. He depicts the earth, heaven, ocean, sun, moon, and constellations (Pleiads, Hyads, Orion, the Bear). He then creates two cities: one of peace, celebrating a wedding feast, a legal dispute over a murder, and elders judging. The other city is at war, besieged by two armies, with an ambush and battle raging over flocks and herds, featuring Mars and Pallas leading the combatants. He also depicts a ploughed field, a harvest, a vineyard, herds of oxen attacked by lions, and a dancing circle. Finally, he pours the ocean around the shield's rim.

After the shield, Vulcan forges a cuirass, greaves of tin, and a helmet with a golden crest. Thetis takes the blazing armor and flies back to her son.

**Book XIX: The Reconciliation of Achilles and Agamemnon**
At dawn, Thetis brings the new divine armor to Achilles, finding him weeping over Patroclus. She comforts him, telling him the armor is worthy of a god. Achilles is awed by the dazzling armor. He expresses concern that Patroclus's body will decay. Thetis reassures him, pouring nectar and ambrosia into Patroclus's nostrils to preserve him, and urges Achilles to renounce his anger and arm for battle.

Achilles, his wrath ended, calls the Greeks to an assembly. Wounded heroes like Diomed, Ulysses, and Agamemnon attend. Achilles publicly declares his anger over and states his readiness to fight. Agamemnon, without rising, takes responsibility, blaming Jove and the goddess Ate for blinding him. He recounts Ate's history, how she even deceived Jove once, and how Jove threw her from Olympus. Agamemnon then reiterates his offer of gifts and Briseïs, swearing an oath that he never touched her.

Achilles, impatient to fight, states he cares only for war, not gifts. Ulysses, however, insists the army must eat and rest to regain strength before battle. He also demands that the gifts be brought forward publicly, and Agamemnon swear his oath before all. Agamemnon agrees.

Achilles still refuses to eat, consumed by grief and thirst for vengeance. He laments Patroclus, recalling their shared meals and his hopes for Patroclus to raise his son. He wishes his father Peleus and son Neoptolemus were not suffering from his absence. Jove, seeing Achilles's suffering, sends Minerva to infuse ambrosia and nectar into his breast, strengthening him.

Achilles then arms himself in the divine armor. His appearance is terrifying, his eyes burning with fire. He tests his new armor, feeling light and powerful. He takes up his great Pelian spear. Automedon and Alcimus harness his horses. Achilles mounts his chariot and addresses Xanthus and Balius, reproaching them for leaving Patroclus to die. Xanthus, by Juno's will, miraculously speaks, acknowledging Patroclus's death was by divine will and prophesying Achilles's own imminent death, not by their fault but by fate and a god. Achilles, undaunted, declares he knows his fate and rushes to battle, vowing Troy's destruction.

**Book XX: The Battle of the Gods, and the Acts of Achilles**
As Achilles returns to battle, Jove convenes the gods on Olympus. He grants permission for all deities to assist either side, fearing that Achilles, unopposed, will prematurely sack Troy against fate. The gods descend to the battlefield. Juno, Neptune, Minerva, Hermes, and Vulcan go to aid the Greeks. Latona, Apollo, Mars, Venus, and Xanthus (Scamander) go to aid the Trojans.

Before the gods engage, Achilles shines in his new armor, inspiring fear in the Trojans. When the gods join, a colossal tumult erupts: Earth trembles, and the heavens resound with their clash. Even Pluto in the underworld is alarmed, fearing Jove's thunder might shatter the earth and expose his realm.

The gods engage in specific duels: Apollo against Neptune, Mars against Pallas, Latona against Hermes, Diana against Juno, and Vulcan against Xanthus (Scamander).

Achilles, however, is consumed with rage for Hector. Apollo, disguised as Lycaon, encourages Æneas to confront Achilles. Æneas is initially reluctant, recalling a previous defeat by Achilles and Minerva. Apollo assures him of divine aid and his noble lineage from Venus and Jove, superior to Achilles's descent from Thetis. Æneas, emboldened, advances.

Juno, seeing Æneas confronting Achilles, calls a council of the Greek-favoring gods. Neptune suggests they observe from a distance, intervening only if a god directly protects Achilles or starts the fight. Juno and Pallas confirm their oath to destroy Troy.

Neptune, moved by Æneas's imminent danger (as fate decrees Æneas is to be the future father of the Dardan line), intervenes. He surrounds Achilles with a thick mist, pulls Æneas's spear from Achilles's shield, and then snatches Æneas up, carrying him over the heads of the combatants to the edge of the battlefield. There, Neptune reveals his divine form and warns Æneas not to fight Achilles until Achilles's death, at which point he can fight with full confidence. Neptune then dispels the mist from Achilles's eyes.

Achilles is amazed to find his spear missing and Æneas gone. He realizes a god has intervened. He then turns his fury on the rest of the Trojans, proclaiming he will thin their ranks with his spear. Hector rallies his Trojans, warning them not to fear Achilles's boasts. Apollo warns Hector to avoid a direct single combat with Achilles and to fight only in the mingled ranks. Hector obeys.

Achilles then unleashes his full rage on the Trojans. He kills Iphytion, Demoleon, Hippodamas, Polydore (Priam's youngest son), Laoganus, Dardanus, Alastor, Mulius, Echeclus, Deucalion, Rhigmas, and his charioteer. He sweeps through the field like a conflagration, trampling bodies with his chariot and horses. The battlefield is drenched in blood, and Achilles remains insatiate in his lust for fame and vengeance.

**Book XXI: The Battle in the River Scamander**
The Trojans flee from Achilles, some towards the city, others plunging into the Scamander (Xanthus) river. Juno covers the fleeing city-bound Trojans with a mist. Achilles pursues those in the river, throwing aside his spear and slaughtering them with his sword. The river runs red with blood. He takes twelve young Trojans alive as captives to be sacrificed to Patroclus's shade.

Achilles then encounters Lycaon, a son of Priam, whom he had previously captured, sold into slavery on Lemnos, and who had recently returned to Troy. Lycaon begs for his life, reminding Achilles of their past encounter and offering a ransom. Achilles, however, hardened by Patroclus's death, refuses, stating that no Trojan will be spared. He kills Lycaon with his sword and casts his body into the river, insulting him and wishing all Trojans met the same fate.

Achilles then confronts Asteropeus, a Paeonian leader and son of the river Axius. Asteropeus, wielding two spears, wounds Achilles's hand, but Achilles's spear is lodged uselessly in the bank. Achilles draws his sword and kills Asteropeus, boasting of his superior lineage (Jove-descended) compared to Asteropeus's river-god father. He casts Asteropeus's body into the Scamander.

The Scamander river god, enraged by the slaughter and the clogging of his waters with bodies, speaks to Achilles in human form, telling him to stop and cast his dead on the plain. Achilles agrees to stop slaughtering in the river but vows not to cease until Troy is within its walls and Hector is slain. Achilles then plunges back into the river.

The river god, Xanthus, rises in fury, creating massive waves to overwhelm Achilles. Achilles seizes an elm to save himself, but the tree is uprooted by the current. He leaps to safety, but Xanthus pursues him with surging waves. Achilles flees across the plain. He calls to Jove, despairing of a shameful death by drowning.

Neptune and Pallas appear in human form, reassuring Achilles that Jove will not let him drown and urging him to continue fighting until Troy is within its walls and Hector is killed. Achilles, emboldened, returns to the fight, wading through the dead and scattered arms.

Xanthus, still enraged, calls upon his brother river Simois for aid. Simois responds by swelling his waters and bringing down logs and stones to attack Achilles. Juno, seeing Achilles in danger, calls upon Vulcan to unleash his fires against the rivers. Vulcan obeys, pouring boundless flames across the plain, consuming the dead, drying the soil, and setting the riverbanks and trees ablaze. The river boils and the fish die.

Xanthus, scorched and in agony, begs Vulcan to cease, promising to desist from aiding Troy. He then pleads with Juno, asking why her son (Vulcan) is inflicting such rage only on him. Juno agrees, telling Vulcan to withdraw his flames, which he does. The rivers return to their normal channels.

With the river gods subdued, the other gods resume their battle. Mars attacks Pallas, but she strikes him with a massive stone, felling him. Venus helps Mars away. Juno mocks Venus, and Pallas strikes Venus lightly, causing them both to fall. Neptune challenges Apollo, reminding him of their past servitude to Laomedon, Priam's father, who cheated them of their wages for building Troy's walls. Apollo refuses to fight for mortals. Diana scolds Apollo for his cowardice, but Juno grabs Diana, disarming her and striking her until she flees. Latona retrieves Diana's bow and arrows. Hermes declines to fight Latona.

The gods return to Olympus. Apollo, still concerned for Troy, enters the city. Achilles continues his slaughter, driving the fleeing Trojans towards the city walls. Priam, seeing the devastation from a tower, orders the city gates opened wide for the fleeing troops but to be shut quickly once they are inside. Apollo rushes forth to meet the Trojans, covering their retreat.

Achilles pursues relentlessly. Apollo, to save Agenor (Antenor's son) from Achilles, gives him divine strength to make a stand. Agenor debates whether to flee or fight, choosing to fight honorably, believing Achilles, though strong, is still mortal. He throws his javelin at Achilles, hitting his knee, but the divine armor protects Achilles. Apollo then shrouds Agenor in a cloud and spirits him away. Apollo then takes on Agenor's form and leads Achilles on a long chase away from the city, allowing the remaining Trojans to safely enter Troy's gates.

**Book XXII: The Death of Hector**
The Trojans are safe within their walls, but Hector alone remains outside, fixed by fate before the Scaean Gate, determined to confront Achilles. Apollo, revealing himself to Achilles, chastises him for pursuing a god. Achilles, enraged at Apollo for robbing him of glory by saving the Trojans, then turns towards the city.

Priam, from the walls, sees Achilles approaching, blazing like the star Sirius. He weeps and desperately calls to Hector to re-enter the city, fearing his death and foreseeing the destruction of Troy and his family. He recounts the many sons Achilles has already slain. He imagines his own horrific death and the desecration of his body. Hecuba, his mother, also pleads with Hector, baring her breast and appealing to his pity as a son.

Hector remains fixed, debating his choices. He regrets rejecting Polydamas's advice to retreat the previous night. He considers confronting Achilles unarmed to negotiate, offering Helen and her treasures, but dismisses the idea as foolish, knowing Achilles's implacable nature. He resolves to fight.

Achilles approaches, his spear glittering. Hector's resolve fails, and he flees in terror, running three times around the walls of Troy, pursued by Achilles. The gods observe. Jove pities Hector, recalling his sacrifices, and asks the gods if they should save him. Pallas firmly reminds Jove that Hector is fated to die. Jove grants Pallas permission to act.

Pallas descends. She appears to Hector in the guise of Deiphobus, his brother, offering to stand by him. Hector, believing he has an ally, turns to face Achilles, suggesting they swear oaths for honorable treatment of the vanquished. Achilles furiously rejects any oaths, comparing their relationship to that of wolves and lambs, and vows only eternal hatred and death. He then throws his spear, which Hector dodges. Pallas retrieves the spear and returns it to Achilles, unseen by Hector.

Hector, unaware of the deception, believes he has missed Achilles and boasts. He throws his own spear, which strikes Achilles's shield but is repelled. He calls for Deiphobus's spear, but Deiphobus is not there. Hector realizes he has been deceived by a god and that his hour has come. He draws his sword and charges Achilles, determined to die gloriously.

Achilles charges Hector, knowing his one vulnerability. His spear pierces Hector's throat, but avoids the windpipe, allowing Hector to speak. Hector falls, mortally wounded. Achilles, standing over him, declares his vengeance for Patroclus complete and gloats that Hector's body will be devoured by dogs. Hector, dying, begs Achilles to return his body to Troy for funeral rites, offering a ransom. Achilles fiercely refuses, wishing he could eat Hector's flesh himself. Hector, with his last breath, prophesies Achilles's death at the Scaean Gate by Paris and Apollo. Hector dies, his soul flying to Hades.

Achilles then strips Hector's armor. The Greeks gather around, marveling at Hector's size and beauty, and wound his body dishonorably. Achilles ties Hector's ankles with thongs, attaches them to his chariot, and drags the body three times around Patroclus's tomb, then towards the ships.

From the walls, Priam and Hecuba witness this horrific spectacle. They wail uncontrollably, tearing their hair and clothes. Priam attempts to rush to the gates, but is restrained by the people. Hecuba, mourning, collapses. Andromache, unaware of Hector's death, is weaving in the palace. She hears the wailing from the walls and, with a boding heart, rushes to the Scaean Gate. She sees Hector's body being dragged by Achilles's chariot. She faints. Upon reviving, she laments Hector's death, foreseeing the doom of Troy and the enslavement or murder of their son, Astyanax. She curses her fate and wishes Hector had given her a last word. She expresses her intention to burn the robes she wove for him, useless now that he is dead.

**Book XXIII: Funeral Games in Honour of Patroclus**
The Greeks, returning to their ships after the battle, mourn Patroclus. Achilles gathers his Myrmidons, ordering them to honor Patroclus by circling his body thrice with their chariots before unharnessing their steeds. They obey, weeping. Achilles, laying his hands on Patroclus's breast, vows to resign Hector's body to dogs and sacrifice twelve Trojan captives on the pyre.

He then throws Hector's body before the bier. The Myrmidons unbrace their armor and feast. Agamemnon's heralds urge Achilles to wash, but he refuses, swearing by Jove not to cleanse himself until Patroclus is buried. He agrees to join the feast but asks Agamemnon to prepare for Patroclus's funeral pile at dawn. The Greeks feast and sleep.

Achilles, however, lies groaning on the shore. In his sleep, the ghost of Patroclus appears to him, urging him to bury his body so his spirit can enter Hades. Patroclus also reminds Achilles of his own fated death and requests that their bones be mixed in a golden urn. Achilles attempts to embrace the phantom, but it vanishes like smoke. Achilles awakens, lamenting the aerial nature of the dead.

At dawn, Agamemnon sends a band with mules and wagons to Ida to fetch timber for the pyre, led by Merion. They fell many trees. The timber is brought back to the shore. The Greek army, in their chariots and arms, processes around Patroclus's body. Achilles, supporting Patroclus's head, cuts off a lock of his own hair, vowed to the river Sperchius, and places it on Patroclus's hand, dedicating it to his friend in the underworld.

Achilles asks Agamemnon to dismiss the troops and let the chiefs alone attend the pyre. The pile is built, a hundred feet square. Patroclus's body is placed on top, covered with fat, and surrounded by slain sheep and oxen, jars of honey and oil. Four horses and two of Achilles's nine dogs are also sacrificed. Finally, Achilles sacrifices twelve Trojan captives he had taken alive. He then sets fire to the pyre.

Achilles prays to the Winds, Zephyr and Boreas, to ignite the flames. Iris, sent by Achilles's prayer, travels to the Winds' hall and delivers the message. The Winds rush forth, causing the pile to blaze fiercely all night. Achilles pours libations from a golden bowl, mourning Patroclus.

At dawn, the flames subside. Achilles, exhausted, is awakened by the gathering Greeks. He orders them to quench the remaining embers with wine, collect Patroclus's bones, and place them in a golden urn, wrapped in fat. He instructs them to build a tomb, a mound of earth, for Patroclus and himself. The Greeks obey.

Achilles then announces the funeral games. Prizes are displayed: for the chariot race, a beautiful woman and a large vase; for second place, an unbroken mare; third, an unburnt charger; fourth, two golden talents; fifth, a double bowl.

Eumelus, Diomed, Menelaus, Antilochus, and Merion compete in the chariot race. Nestor advises his son Antilochus on strategy. Phœnix is sent to judge. Eumelus leads, followed by Diomed. Apollo, angered by Diomed, strikes his whip from his hand. Pallas restores the whip and breaks Eumelus's chariot, causing him to crash. Diomed wins, followed by Antilochus (who skillfully passed Menelaus), Menelaus, Merion, and Eumelus (last). Achilles pities Eumelus and proposes to give him the second prize. Antilochus protests, asserting his right to the prize he won. Achilles, pleased by Antilochus's flattery, gives Eumelus a corslet as a special gift, and Antilochus keeps the mare. Menelaus then challenges Antilochus's honor, asking him to swear he did not cheat. Antilochus humbly declines to swear, admitting his youthful rashness and yielding the mare to Menelaus. Menelaus, his anger assuaged, returns the mare to Antilochus, praising his wisdom. Merion receives the golden talents. Achilles gives the double bowl to Nestor as an honorary prize, acknowledging his age and past prowess.

Next, a boxing match is held, with a mule for the winner and a goblet for the loser. Epeüs, a huge fighter, challenges anyone, threatening to smash their bones. Euryalus accepts. Epeüs knocks Euryalus out with a punch to the cheek.

For wrestling, a tripod is the prize for the victor, a captive woman for the loser. Ajax Telamon and Ulysses compete. They wrestle fiercely, unable to throw each other. Ajax suggests they lift each other; he lifts Ulysses, but Ulysses trips him. They fall side-by-side. Achilles declares it a tie and awards them equal prizes.

For the foot race, a silver urn is the prize, an ox for second, and half a talent for third. Ajax Oïleus, Ulysses, and Antilochus compete. Pallas aids Ulysses. Ajax trips on cow dung left from the sacrifices, and Ulysses wins. Ajax complains that Pallas helped Ulysses. Antilochus, though last, makes a witty remark about the gods favoring the wise (Ulysses) and old, and receives a talent of gold from Achilles.

For the armed combat, Sarpedon's armor is the prize, with a Thracian sword for the striker. Diomed and Ajax Telamon compete. They clash spears three times. Greece calls for them to stop, and Achilles agrees. Diomed wins the sword and belt.

For the discus throw (a mass of iron), Polypœtes wins, throwing it furthest, followed by Leonteus, Ajax, and Epeüs.

For archery, ten double-edged axes for hitting a dove and ten single axes for cutting the cord that ties it. Teucer and Merion compete. Teucer shoots first, cutting the cord, and the dove flies free. Merion shoots next, hitting the dove in mid-air. Merion wins the double axes.

Finally, for javelin throwing, a spear and a charger are the prizes. Merion and Agamemnon are the contestants. Achilles declares Agamemnon the superior leader and awards him the prize without competition, but allows Merion to take the spear in his stead. Agamemnon then gives the charger to Talthybius.

**Book XXIV: The Redemption of the Body of Hector**
The games conclude, and the Greeks feast and sleep, but Achilles continues to mourn Patroclus, rolling restlessly on his bed. At dawn, he harnesses his horses and drags Hector's body three times around Patroclus's tomb, then returns it to his tent. Apollo protects Hector's body from mutilation and decay.

After twelve days, the gods are moved by pity for Hector's body. Apollo speaks in the Olympian council, criticizing the gods' cruelty and Achilles's savage rage, advocating for Hector's body to be returned for burial. Juno, still implacable, rejects this, emphasizing Achilles's divine lineage compared to Hector's mortal birth.

Jupiter intercedes, acknowledging Hector's piety. He forbids any god from secretly stealing the body and sends Thetis to Achilles to command him to release Hector's body for ransom. He then sends Iris to Priam, encouraging him to go alone to Achilles's tent with gifts to ransom his son, promising divine protection.

Thetis descends to Achilles, who is still mourning. She urges him to accept the ransom, as it is Jove's command. Achilles agrees. Iris then goes to Priam, finding him and his remaining sons in deep grief. She delivers Jove's message, assuring Priam of safe passage and Achilles's compassion.

Priam immediately prepares for the journey, despite Hecuba's desperate pleas against it. She fears Achilles will kill him and begs him to make libations to Jove first. Priam, firm in his resolve, prays to Jove, asking for an omen: a strong eagle flying on the right. Jove sends the eagle, which Priam sees as a sign of divine favor.

Priam prepares gifts: twelve carpets, twelve vests, twelve mantles, twelve veils, ten talents of gold, two tripods, two chargers, and a large bowl. He rages at his remaining sons, calling them worthless compared to his fallen heroes. His sons then harness the mules to a wagon for the gifts and the horses to Priam's chariot. Hecuba makes a final, tearful plea. Priam again asserts Jove's command.

Priam and the herald Idæus set out. Jove, seeing Priam's sorrow, sends Hermes to guide and protect them. Hermes, disguised as a young man, meets them by a spring. Idæus, spotting him, warns Priam of an approaching foe. Priam is terrified. Hermes reveals himself as a Greek sent to protect them and asks about their purpose. Priam explains his mission. Hermes assures him that Hector's body is preserved by the gods and is untouched. Priam, joyful, offers Hermes a goblet, which Hermes refuses out of respect for Achilles.

Hermes then takes the reins, leads them past the sleeping Greek guards (whom he puts into a deep slumber with his wand), opens the gates, and guides the chariot to Achilles's tent. Hermes reveals his divine identity to Priam and vanishes.

Priam enters Achilles's tent, surprising Achilles, Automedon, and Alcimus. Priam falls at Achilles's feet, embraces his knees, and kisses the hands that killed his sons. He appeals to Achilles's memory of his own father, Peleus, and his inevitable grief. He describes his own immense suffering, having lost so many sons, including Hector, the last and bravest. He begs Achilles to accept the ransom and return Hector's body.

Achilles is moved to tears by the thought of his own father. Both men weep, Achilles for his father and Patroclus, Priam for Hector. Achilles, rising, gently raises Priam, reminding him that man is born to suffer and recounting the two urns of Jove (one of good, one of evil). He shares his own father's sorrow, a king with only one son destined to die young. He tells Priam that Hector's fate was determined by the gods.

Priam again requests Hector's body and offers the gifts. Achilles, with a flash of anger, warns Priam not to provoke him further, stating he intends to return Hector's body by Jove's command, and reminding Priam that he is on hostile ground.

Achilles orders his attendants to prepare Hector's body, bathing and anointing it away from Priam's sight to prevent any renewed outburst of rage. They cover the body with garments. Achilles himself lifts Hector onto the funeral car. He then addresses Patroclus's shade, asking forgiveness for returning Hector, but noting it is Jove's will, and the gifts are for Patroclus's honor.

Achilles invites Priam to dine with him, urging him to eat and find repose, recounting the myth of Niobe as an example of bearing grief. He then offers a twelve-day truce for Hector's funeral. Priam accepts. Achilles and Priam share a meal. Priam then asks to sleep. Achilles prepares a bed for him outside the inner tent.

During the night, Hermes awakens Priam, warning him that the Greeks might discover him and demand a higher ransom or hold him hostage. Priam and Idæus quickly depart with Hector's body and gifts. Hermes guides them through the Greek camp and across the Xanthus river, then returns to Olympus.

At dawn, Cassandra, from Troy's walls, spots Priam's returning wagon with Hector's body. She alerts the city. The Trojans pour from the gates, wailing, to meet the wagon. Hecuba and Andromache lead the lamentations. Priam commands them to first bring the body to the palace. Inside, the women mourn.

Andromache embraces Hector's body, lamenting his untimely death and foreseeing the fall of Troy and their son Astyanax's grim future as an orphan and slave, to be thrown from the city walls. Hecuba also laments, noting that even in death, Hector is preserved by the gods, unlike her other sons sold into slavery. Helen, filled with sorrow and guilt, mourns Hector as her only kind friend in Troy, lamenting her own role as the cause of misery.

Priam then commands the Trojans to gather wood for Hector's funeral pyre, as Achilles has granted a twelve-day truce. For nine days, they fell trees on Ida. On the tenth day, Hector's body is placed on the pyre and burned. On the eleventh day, his bones are collected in a golden urn, wrapped in purple cloth, and buried under a great mound, watched by guards. On the twelfth day, after a final funeral feast, the Trojans rest, and the poem concludes with Hector's shade at peace."
The Scarlet Letter-Nathaniel Hawthorne,"The provided text, ""The Scarlet Letter,"" begins with a lengthy ""Custom-House"" introduction before narrating the main story.

**Part 1: The Custom-House (Introduction)**

The narrator describes his native town of Salem, Massachusetts, focusing on the dilapidated Custom-House where he held the position of Surveyor. This brick edifice, located at the head of a decaying wharf, once bustled with commercial life but now shows few signs of it. He notes the American eagle ornamenting its front, which he perceives as threatening mischief to the community.

The narrator describes his elderly Custom-House colleagues, mostly retired sea-captains, as inefficient, often asleep, and prone to endless repetitions of old sea-stories. He admits to ""abbreviating the official breath"" of some, implying he caused their retirement or death. He also details a permanent Inspector, a robust eighty-year-old man of strong animal nature, minimal intellect or morality, who enjoyed life's physical pleasures and had outlived three wives and many of his twenty children. The narrator found this man a ""rare phenomenon,"" existing solely on instinct. Another notable figure is the Collector, a gallant old General whose military past shines through his current infirmity and quiet contemplation. A ""man of business"" is also described as the efficient ""main-spring"" of the Custom-House, whose integrity and ability to solve complex issues are exceptional.

The narrator reflects on how his time in this public office has stifled his imaginative and literary faculties. He feels that writing became a ""hopeless toil"" and that he had become merely a ""tolerably good Surveyor of the Customs,"" losing the ""pith and availability"" of his spirit. He concludes that continuous public office diminishes one's self-support and better attributes.

A significant event in his third year as Surveyor is the election of General Taylor to the Presidency, which brings in a hostile administration. The narrator, a Democrat, anticipates being removed from office. He describes the ""blood-thirstiness"" of the victorious Whig party in removing office-holders. His own ""head was the first that fell,"" meaning he was dismissed from his post.

This ""unceremonious ejectment"" is ultimately a welcome event, freeing him from an ""unnatural state"" and allowing him to return to his literary pursuits.

One ""idle and rainy day,"" while searching through old, forgotten official documents in an unfinished room of the Custom-House, the narrator discovers a ""small package, carefully done up in a piece of ancient yellow parchment."" Inside, he finds a commission for one Jonathan Pue, a former Surveyor of his Majesty’s Customs for Salem in the late 17th century, whose remains were later dug up from a graveyard.

More importantly, among Pue's private papers, the narrator finds a ""reasonably complete explanation of the whole affair"" concerning a ""noteworthy personage"" named Hester Prynne, based on oral testimonies collected by Pue. The most captivating object in the package is a ""certain affair of fine red cloth, much worn and faded,"" which, upon examination, reveals itself to be a ""capital letter A,"" elaborately embroidered with gold-thread. When the narrator places this scarlet letter on his own breast, he experiences a sensation of ""burning heat,"" as if it were ""red-hot iron.""

The narrator feels as though the ""ghost of Mr. Surveyor Pue"" appears to him, urging him to bring Hester Prynne's story to the public, promising him profit and charging him to give credit to his predecessor. Inspired by this, and now free from the Custom-House, the narrator is able to revive his imagination and dedicate himself to writing the tale of ""The Scarlet Letter."" He notes that the original papers and the scarlet letter artifact are still in his possession. He concludes by observing that his Custom-House life now feels like a dream and that he is a ""citizen of somewhere else,"" finding the literary atmosphere in Salem lacking.

**Part 2: The Scarlet Letter (The Main Narrative)**

**Chapter I: The Prison-Door**
On a summer morning, a crowd of stern-faced Puritan men and women gather in front of Boston's old, weather-stained wooden prison. The prison itself is an early necessity of the colony, representing the severity of its laws. By the door, a wild rose-bush blooms, offering its delicate beauty as a symbol of nature's pity for those condemned.

**Chapter II: The Market-Place**
The crowd, particularly the women, discuss the impending punishment of Hester Prynne. They express a desire for harsher penalties, such as branding her forehead, or even death, for her ""evil doings"" and for bringing shame upon the community and Reverend Master Dimmesdale's church. A younger woman suggests the pang of shame is already in Hester's heart.
The town-beadle opens the prison door, and Hester Prynne emerges, a tall, elegant woman with dark, abundant hair and striking beauty. She carries a three-month-old infant in her arms. On her breast, Hester wears a meticulously embroidered scarlet letter ""A"" fashioned from fine red cloth and gold-thread, which, despite being a mark of infamy, appears as an artistic embellishment, highlighting her defiant spirit.
The beadle leads Hester through the throng to a scaffold in the market-place, a platform for public shame. Hester endures the stares of the crowd with an outward haughtiness, but inwardly experiences intense agony. Her mind drifts through memories of her childhood in Old England, her parents, and a pale, deformed, scholarly man—her husband—whom she left behind.
In the crowd, Hester spots this very man, now accompanied by an Indian. He is Roger Chillingworth, her long-lost husband, who signals her to keep silent. He questions a townsman about Hester's identity and crime, learning that she has been in Boston for two years, her husband has been missing, and she has given birth to a child whose father's identity she refuses to reveal. Chillingworth remarks on her sentence of public display and life-long wearing of the scarlet letter, adding, ""He will be known!""
Reverend John Wilson calls upon the young minister, Arthur Dimmesdale, Hester's pastor, to compel her to name the father. Dimmesdale, pale and trembling, exhorts Hester to confess for her own soul's peace and for the sake of the hidden father, suggesting that continued secrecy would only add hypocrisy to sin. Hester firmly refuses, declaring her child will only know a heavenly father. Dimmesdale, with a gasp, acknowledges her ""wondrous strength.""
Reverend Wilson preaches a long sermon on sin. Hester remains on the scaffold, numb to the torment. She is then led back to prison, where it is whispered that the scarlet letter casts a ""lurid gleam"" in the dark passage.

**Chapter IV: The Interview**
Back in prison, Hester is in a state of nervous excitement, and her infant is suffering convulsions. Roger Chillingworth, the man from the market-place, enters, identifying himself as a physician. He gives the ailing infant a calming draught, which quickly puts it to sleep. He then offers Hester a similar draught, which she initially fears is poison. Chillingworth assures her it is for good, saying he wishes her to live and bear her shame. He then lays his finger on her scarlet letter, which seems to scorch her breast.
Chillingworth reveals himself as Hester's husband. He recounts his folly in marrying her youthful beauty with his aged, deformed, scholarly self. Hester admits she never loved him. He absolves her of wrongdoing against him, stating that he was the ""first wrong"" for betraying her. However, he demands to know the identity of the child's father, the man who ""wronged us both."" Hester refuses. Chillingworth vows to discover the man, stating, ""Sooner or later, he must needs be mine!"" He promises not to betray him to human law or harm his life, but rather to inflict a more intimate, psychological vengeance. He extracts a solemn oath from Hester to keep his identity secret, warning that if she fails, the man's ""fame, his position, his life, will be in my hands."" Hester swears. As he leaves, Hester asks if he is the ""Black Man"" and if he has lured her into a soul-ruining bond. Chillingworth replies, ""Not thy soul. No, not thine!""

**Chapter V: Hester at Her Needle**
After her release from prison, Hester chooses to remain in Boston, settling in a solitary cottage on the outskirts. She supports herself and Pearl through exquisite needlework, which becomes fashionable for official garments and funerals, but is explicitly excluded from bridal attire. She dresses herself plainly, with the scarlet letter as her only adornment, but clothes Pearl in elaborate, crimson and gold garments that echo the letter's defiance. Hester performs charitable acts, often receiving insults in return, viewing this as penance.
Seven years pass. Hester endures social ostracism and the psychological torment of the scarlet letter, which seems to brand her soul afresh with every curious glance. Over time, her tireless charity and quiet dignity cause public perception to shift; some begin to interpret the ""A"" as meaning ""Able."" The letter has also transformed Hester, hardening her character, making her more intellectual and speculative, but less warm and passionate. She realizes the scarlet letter has not fully achieved its ""office"" of repentance. She now resolves to save Arthur Dimmesdale from Chillingworth's torment, which she feels is partly her responsibility. She spots Chillingworth in the forest, gathering herbs, and decides to confront him.

**Chapter VI: Pearl**
Pearl is described as a wild, beautiful, and ""elf-like"" child, the living symbol of her mother's sin and passion. Hester named her ""Pearl"" because she was ""of great price,"" bought with all her mother had. Pearl is beyond conventional discipline, displaying a capricious, mischievous, sometimes malicious nature. Hester often questions if Pearl is truly human or a ""demon offspring."" Pearl is an outcast among other children, who mock her, and she retaliates fiercely. At home, she creates an imaginary world of adversaries, never friends.
Pearl's first conscious awareness was the scarlet letter on Hester's bosom, which she frequently touches, points at, and questions. She throws wild-flowers at the ""A"" on her mother's chest. Pearl talks about the ""Black Man"" who haunts the forest and marks people. Hester confirms she met the Black Man once and the scarlet letter is his mark. Pearl persistently asks Hester what the letter means and why the minister keeps his hand over his heart.

**Chapter VII: The Governor’s Hall**
Hester visits Governor Bellingham's mansion to deliver embroidered gloves and, more importantly, to defend her right to keep Pearl, as some influential citizens are seeking to remove Pearl from her care. Pearl, dressed in a magnificent crimson and gold dress, is a striking figure. Inside the mansion, Hester sees her exaggerated reflection in a burnished suit of armor, where the scarlet letter appears ""gigantic"" and seems to hide her entirely. Pearl points to it with an ""elfish intelligence.""

**Chapter VIII: The Elf-Child and the Minister**
Governor Bellingham, Reverend Wilson, Reverend Dimmesdale, and Roger Chillingworth gather in the Governor's hall. They question Pearl, who, in a perverse mood, refuses to answer correctly when asked who made her, claiming she was ""plucked by her mother off the bush of wild roses that grew by the prison-door."" The Governor considers taking Pearl from Hester. Hester passionately defends her right to keep Pearl, declaring that God gave her the child as both a joy and a torture, and that Pearl ""is the scarlet letter, only capable of being loved."" She desperately turns to Dimmesdale, urging him to speak for her.
Dimmesdale, pale and holding his hand over his heart, eloquently argues that Pearl is both a blessing and a punishment for Hester, sent by God to keep her mother's soul alive and guide her to heaven. His plea convinces the magistrates to allow Hester to keep Pearl. Chillingworth remarks on Dimmesdale's ""strange earnestness."" Pearl, in an unusual display of affection, takes Dimmesdale's hand and allows him to kiss her brow, then reverts to her usual capriciousness. Chillingworth covertly suggests that Pearl's nature could ""give a shrewd guess at the father."" As Hester and Pearl leave, Mistress Hibbins, the Governor's sister (reputed to be a witch), invites Hester to a forest gathering with the ""Black Man."" Hester declines, but says if Pearl had been taken, she would have gone and signed the Black Man's book with her own blood. Hibbins hints that Hester will join them ""anon.""

**Chapter IX: The Leech**
Roger Chillingworth, concealing his true identity as Hester's husband, establishes himself as a physician in Boston. He becomes Dimmesdale's trusted medical adviser, moving into the same house to monitor the minister's rapidly declining health. Dimmesdale suffers from unexplained illness, characterized by paleness, a tremulous voice, and a habit of clutching his hand over his heart. Chillingworth, previously a kind and upright man, now displays a malevolent change in his appearance, leading many townspeople to suspect he is Satan's emissary, burrowing into the minister's intimacy to plot against his soul.

**Chapter X: The Leech and His Patient**
Chillingworth pursues his revenge on Dimmesdale, metaphorically digging into his heart for his secret sin. Dimmesdale, too sensitive and burdened by his own secret, fails to recognize Chillingworth as his enemy, even as the physician relentlessly torments him psychologically. Chillingworth gathers dark herbs from an unmarked grave, suggesting they symbolize a hidden, unconfessed sin. He provokes Dimmesdale into a discussion about hidden sins versus open confession, arguing that those who hide their sins deceive themselves. Pearl, playing in the graveyard with Hester, throws a burr at Dimmesdale, who recoils. Pearl then warns her mother that the ""old Black Man"" (Chillingworth) has ""got hold of the minister already.""
Chillingworth presses Dimmesdale to reveal his ""wound or trouble in your soul."" Dimmesdale passionately refuses, asserting he will confess only to God. He rushes from the room. Chillingworth observes that Dimmesdale's passion reveals his hidden sin. Later, while Dimmesdale sleeps, Chillingworth secretly examines his breast. He recoils with a ""wild look of wonder, joy, and horror,"" a ""ghastly rapture,"" realizing he has confirmed Dimmesdale's secret.

**Chapter XI: The Interior of a Heart**
Chillingworth's revenge now becomes active and subtle, playing upon Dimmesdale's fears and remorse, perfecting his torment. Dimmesdale, though vaguely sensing an ""evil influence"" from Chillingworth, attributes his aversion to his own morbid state and continues to associate with the physician.
Meanwhile, Dimmesdale achieves immense popularity as a minister, his sermons deeply moving the congregation. His suffering enhances his eloquence and ability to connect with the ""sinful brotherhood of mankind."" The people revere him as a saint, creating an agonizing contrast with his hidden guilt. He repeatedly attempts to confess his sin from the pulpit by speaking in general terms of his vileness, but the congregation only interprets this as extreme humility and holiness, increasing their reverence. He performs secret self-punishments: scourging himself, fasting, and keeping vigils during which he experiences vivid visions of devils, angels, his parents, and Hester and Pearl pointing at his breast. One night, a new thought strikes him, and he leaves his study.

**Chapter XII: The Minister’s Vigil**
Dimmesdale goes to the scaffold where Hester stood seven years ago and ascends its steps in the darkness of an early May night. He imagines the townspeople discovering him there and letting out a shriek of horror. No one wakes, but Governor Bellingham and Mistress Hibbins briefly appear at their windows, interpreting the sound differently. Reverend Mr. Wilson passes by with a lantern, returning from the deathbed of Governor Winthrop, whom Dimmesdale had also visited. Dimmesdale imagines speaking to Wilson but does not.
He is joined on the scaffold by Hester and Pearl, who were also returning from Governor Winthrop’s deathbed (Hester had taken his measure for a robe). Dimmesdale takes Pearl's hand, feeling a rush of new life. Pearl asks if he will stand with them ""to-morrow noontide,"" but he, fearing public exposure, refuses, promising to stand with them ""at the great judgment day."" As he speaks, a meteor blazes across the sky, forming a dull red ""A."" Dimmesdale, interpreting this as a sign from God, is simultaneously terrified. Pearl points to Roger Chillingworth, who is standing nearby, his face filled with malevolence. Dimmesdale, overcome with terror, whispers to Hester that he hates and fears Chillingworth, demanding to know who he is. Hester remains silent, bound by her oath. Pearl mischievously tells him he was not ""bold"" or ""true"" for refusing to stand with them publicly. Chillingworth approaches, feigning concern, and leads Dimmesdale home, commenting on his ""night-whimseys.""
The next day, Dimmesdale delivers his most powerful Election Sermon, but the sexton returns his glove, found on the scaffold, and reports that the meteor ""A"" was seen, which the town interprets as ""Angel"" for the deceased Governor Winthrop.

**Chapter XIII: Another View of Hester**
Hester is shocked by Dimmesdale's moral decay under Chillingworth's insidious influence. She feels responsible for his suffering, having kept Chillingworth's identity secret. In the seven years since her public shaming, Hester's character has changed; her suffering has deepened her thought and allowed her to speculate freely on society's laws. Her good deeds and quiet endurance have softened public opinion, with many now interpreting her scarlet ""A"" as signifying ""Able."" However, her beauty and passionate nature have withered. Recognizing the depth of Dimmesdale's misery, Hester resolves to undo her error and reveal Chillingworth's true nature to him, regardless of the consequences.

**Chapter XIV: Hester and the Physician**
Hester sends Pearl to play by the water and confronts Chillingworth. He informs her that magistrates have considered removing the scarlet letter from her, a suggestion he supported. Hester calmly replies that only her worthiness, not their decree, can remove it. Hester observes a terrifying transformation in Chillingworth: his former scholarly calm has given way to an ""eager, searching, almost fierce"" look, with ""a glare of red light out of his eyes."" She realizes he has become a ""devil"" through his relentless revenge.
Hester accuses him of tormenting Dimmesdale, making him live a ""daily a living death."" Chillingworth admits his role, boasting that no mortal has suffered as Dimmesdale has, and that he (Chillingworth) has become a ""fiend for his especial torment."" He laments his own transformation, asking Hester, ""Who made me so?"" Hester replies, ""It was myself! ... It was I, not less than he."" She declares her intention to reveal his identity to Dimmesdale, stating there is no good in Dimmesdale continuing a ""life of ghastly emptiness."" Chillingworth, acknowledging their shared ""fate,"" allows her to proceed, saying, ""Let the black flower blossom as it may!"" He returns to gathering herbs.

**Chapter XV: Hester and Pearl**
Hester, reflecting on Chillingworth, acknowledges her hatred for him, feeling he wronged her more by making her think she was happy with him. Pearl returns from playing by the brook, having fashioned a ""green letter A"" of seaweed on her own bosom. She asks Hester what her scarlet letter means and why the minister keeps his hand over his heart. Hester, caught off guard, lies and says she wears it for its ""gold-thread."" Pearl, with ""mischief gleaming in her black eyes,"" continues to press the questions, leading Hester to a rare outburst of anger.

**Chapter XVI: A Forest Walk**
Hester seeks to meet Dimmesdale in the forest to reveal Chillingworth's identity, avoiding public scrutiny. She brings Pearl. The path into the ""primeval forest"" mirrors Hester's ""moral wilderness."" Pearl notes that the sunshine avoids Hester and her scarlet letter. Pearl tells Hester the story of the ""Black Man"" who haunts the forest and marks those who sign his book; she asks if the scarlet letter is his mark, and Hester confirms it. They sit by a melancholy brook. Dimmesdale approaches, looking haggard and feeble, still holding his hand over his heart.

**Chapter XVII: The Pastor and His Parishioner**
Hester calls out to Dimmesdale, who, startled, recognizes her. They speak as if ghosts, touching cold hands. Dimmesdale confesses his profound despair and misery, telling Hester that the public reverence only deepens his torment, as he knows himself to be a ""pollution and a lie."" He envies Hester's open shame, saying, ""Mine burns in secret!"" He admits that looking into her eyes, which know him for what he is, is a relief. Hester, revealing Chillingworth's true identity as her husband and Dimmesdale's secret tormentor, begs his forgiveness for her complicity. Dimmesdale is overwhelmed by rage and despair but ultimately forgives her, stating Chillingworth's revenge is ""blacker than my sin."" They reaffirm their bond.
Dimmesdale expresses fear of Chillingworth's continued vengeance. Hester, asserting her strength, urges him to escape New England, suggesting they flee into the wilderness or across the sea to Europe, where he can live a true life and fulfill his potential as a teacher or scholar. Dimmesdale, broken and weak, despairs that he cannot go alone. Hester whispers, ""Thou shalt not go alone!""

**Chapter XVIII: A Flood of Sunshine**
Dimmesdale, filled with hope and joy mixed with fear, agrees to flee with Hester. Hester, symbolizing their liberation from the past, unclasps the scarlet letter from her bosom and throws it into the withered leaves near the brook. A great burden lifts from her. She removes her cap, allowing her dark, rich hair to fall, and her beauty, youth, and womanhood return, accompanied by a radiant smile and a crimson flush. The forest, previously gloomy, is suddenly flooded with sunshine.
Hester calls Pearl to meet Dimmesdale, assuring him Pearl will love him. Pearl, who has been playing harmoniously with wild creatures in the forest, approaches slowly.

**Chapter XIX: The Child at the Brook-Side**
Hester and Dimmesdale observe Pearl, recognizing her as the ""living hieroglyphic"" of their shared secret and the bond uniting them. Pearl reaches the brook, but stands on the far side, gazing at them. Dimmesdale is nervous about meeting her. Pearl, observing her mother's now unadorned bosom, points her finger at it, and refuses to cross the brook, gesticulating wildly. Hester realizes Pearl ""misses something which she has always seen me wear!""
Hester, with a heavy sigh, retrieves the scarlet letter from the leaves and fastens it back on her breast. Instantly, her beauty and warmth vanish, replaced by a ""gray shadow,"" and she confines her hair again. Pearl then bounds across the brook and embraces her mother, kissing the scarlet letter too. Pearl asks Dimmesdale if he loves them and if he will walk hand-in-hand with them into town. Hester says not now, but ""in days to come."" Pearl then asks if he will ""always keep his hand over his heart?"" Despite Hester's encouragement, Pearl refuses to greet Dimmesdale warmly, and when he kisses her brow, she runs to the brook and washes it off. Hester and Dimmesdale continue to make plans for their escape.

**Chapter XX: The Minister in a Maze**
Dimmesdale leaves Hester and Pearl to walk back to town alone, filled with an unaccustomed physical energy, but also a sense of profound change, as if he is a new man. He feels a series of strange, wicked impulses as he encounters townspeople: to utter blasphemy to a deacon, to whisper an anti-immortality argument to a pious widow, to corrupt a young maiden, and to swear with a drunken sailor. He resists these, mostly due to habit and decorum, but questions if he has made a pact with the ""fiend.""
Mistress Hibbins appears and hints that she knows of his forest meeting with the ""Black Man,"" implying a secret connection and predicting his hidden mark will be revealed. Dimmesdale denies her insinuations.
He returns to his study, where Chillingworth finds him. Chillingworth feigns concern for Dimmesdale's health and offers remedies for the Election Sermon. Dimmesdale declines, sensing Chillingworth knows of his plan to flee with Hester. Chillingworth, recognizing his true enemy, still offers aid, and Dimmesdale thanks him, offering prayers. After Chillingworth leaves, Dimmesdale, feeling inspired, destroys his old Election Sermon and writes a new, powerful one through the night.

**Chapter XXI: The New England Holiday**
On Election Day, the market-place is thronged for the new Governor's installation. Hester, in her drab clothes with the scarlet letter, feels a sense of impending triumph and freedom, while Pearl is exuberantly dressed. Pearl comments on the minister's strangeness, how he greets them in secret but ignores them in public, and still keeps his hand over his heart.
The procession, with military escort and civil leaders, moves through the market-place. Dimmesdale, in the procession, exhibits an unusual, almost spiritual, energy. Hester watches him, feeling a sense of his remoteness, doubting their bond. Mistress Hibbins speaks to Hester, again hinting at Dimmesdale's secret connection to the ""Black Man"" and predicting his shame will be revealed. Pearl overhears.
A shipmaster, whose vessel will take Hester and Dimmesdale to Bristol, approaches Hester and, believing Chillingworth is Dimmesdale's friend, reveals that Chillingworth has also booked passage on the ship to accompany ""his friend, the gentleman she wots of."" Hester's hopes for escape are crushed as she realizes Chillingworth knows their plan and will continue his torment. She endures the intensified stares of the crowd, the scarlet letter burning more painfully than ever.

**Chapter XXII: The Procession**
The procession continues, and Dimmesdale, having delivered his powerful Election Sermon, appears feeble and pale, his temporary energy gone. He approaches the scaffold where Hester and Pearl stand. Governor Bellingham moves to support him, but Dimmesdale's expression warns him off.

**Chapter XXIII: The Revelation of the Scarlet Letter**
Dimmesdale, at the peak of his public acclaim, turns towards the scaffold and calls for Hester and Pearl. Pearl flies to him, embracing his knees, while Hester approaches slowly. Roger Chillingworth rushes forward, trying to stop Dimmesdale, whispering, ""Madman, hold! what is your purpose? ... I can yet save you!"" Dimmesdale, overcoming Chillingworth's power, declares, ""Thy power is not what it was! With God’s help, I shall escape thee now!"" He extends his hand to Hester, asking her to support him on the scaffold, against the ""wretched and wronged old man.""
Supported by Hester and holding Pearl's hand, Dimmesdale ascends the scaffold. Chillingworth follows, darkly remarking that this scaffold was the only place Dimmesdale could escape him. Dimmesdale addresses the appalled multitude, confessing he is ""the one sinner of the world."" With a convulsive motion, he tears open his ministerial vestment, revealing a ""SCARLET LETTER"" imprinted on his own breast, a ghastly miracle matching Hester's.
Dimmesdale, with a ""flush of triumph,"" collapses on the scaffold. Hester supports him. Chillingworth, defeated, kneels beside him, repeating, ""Thou hast escaped me!"" Dimmesdale forgives Chillingworth, saying, ""Thou, too, hast deeply sinned!""
He turns to Pearl, asking her to kiss him now, as she would not in the forest. Pearl kisses his lips, breaking a spell. Her tears fall on his cheek, signifying her connection to human joy and sorrow. Dimmesdale and Hester share a final, solemn exchange about their immortal souls, with Dimmesdale fearing no ""pure reunion"" after their sin, but acknowledging God's mercy in his afflictions, which led him to this public confession. He dies with the word ""Farewell!""

**Chapter XXIV: Conclusion**
After Dimmesdale's death, there are varying accounts of the events on the scaffold. Most witnesses claim to have seen a scarlet letter imprinted on his breast, like Hester's. Theories for its origin include self-inflicted penance, Chillingworth's magic, or the physical manifestation of his remorse. Some witnesses, however, deny any mark or confession, claiming Dimmesdale's death was a parable about human righteousness being ""nugatory"" before God. The narrator, referencing Mr. Surveyor Pue's manuscript, confirms Dimmesdale's guilt and offers the moral: ""Be true! Be true! Be true! Show freely to the world, if not your worst, yet some trait whereby the worst may be inferred!""
Roger Chillingworth, having lost his object of revenge, rapidly withers and dies within a year, bequeathing a considerable amount of property to little Pearl. Pearl thus becomes a rich heiress. Shortly after Chillingworth's death, Hester Prynne and Pearl disappear from Boston.
Many years later, Hester Prynne returns to her old cottage by the sea-shore, still wearing the scarlet letter, which she has resumed willingly. The fate of Pearl is not known with certainty, but indications like letters with seals and luxurious gifts suggest she is alive, married, happy, wealthy, and mindful of her mother, possibly having a child of her own (hinted at by Hester embroidering a baby-garment).
Hester dedicates the remainder of her life to offering comfort and counsel to women burdened by sorrow and ""sinful passion,"" always believing that a ""new truth"" will eventually establish a surer relation between man and woman. She had once imagined herself to be the prophetess of this truth, but realized a woman ""stained with sin"" could not fulfill that role.
After many years, Hester Prynne dies and is buried in the same graveyard as Dimmesdale, near his old grave, but with a space between them. One tombstone serves for both, bearing a simple escutcheon with the motto: ""ON A FIELD, SABLE, THE LETTER A, GULES."""
Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea-Jules Verne,"The plot of the provided text, ""Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea,"" unfolds as follows:

In 1866, a mysterious, enormous, spindle-shaped, occasionally phosphorescent object, far larger and faster than any known whale, began to be sighted by ships worldwide. This phenomenon, which generated immense public interest and debate, was reported by various vessels. For instance, on July 20, 1866, the steamer *Governor Higginson* encountered it off Australia, identifying it as an unknown aquatic mammal after it ejected water columns. Three days later, the *Columbus* observed it in the Pacific, noting its surprising speed. Later, the *Helvetia* and *Shannon* simultaneously sighted it in the Atlantic, estimating its length at over 350 feet. Numerous other ships reported collisions or sightings.

By early 1867, the phenomenon was seen as a real danger rather than just a scientific curiosity. On March 5, the *Moravian* struck an uncharted rock, sustaining hull damage. On April 13, the *Scotia* was struck, suffering a two-yard triangular hole in its bottom, seemingly caused by a sharp, powerful instrument that then withdrew. Public opinion demanded the elimination of this ""formidable cetacean.""

M. Pierre Aronnax, an Assistant Professor at the Museum of Natural History in Paris, was in New York at this time. He was well-versed in the public discussions. The theories of a floating island or wreck were dismissed due to the object's rapid movement. Two main hypotheses remained: a colossal marine monster or a submarine vessel. The latter was widely rejected as impossible to build in secret by a private entity or a government without detection. Aronnax, pressured by the *New York Herald*, published an article on April 30, proposing the existence of a gigantic, powerfully organized narwhal with an electric, piercing horn, capable of withstanding immense deep-sea pressures. This article gained support.

The United States government, driven by public opinion, commissioned the fast frigate *Abraham Lincoln* under Commander Farragut to hunt the monster. After two months of no sightings, news arrived on July 2 that the creature had been seen in the North Pacific. Aronnax received an invitation from the Secretary of Marine, J.B. Hobson, to join the expedition, representing France.

Aronnax immediately accepted, calling his devoted Flemish servant, Conseil, who calmly packed their belongings. They boarded the *Abraham Lincoln* at Brooklyn, meeting Commander Farragut. The frigate, armed with various whaling implements and a powerful breech-loading gun, set sail from New York, cheered by crowds, and headed into the Atlantic.

On board was Ned Land, a renowned Canadian harpooner. While the crew shared Farragut's unwavering belief in the monster, Ned Land remained skeptical, arguing that no mammal could damage an iron ship. Aronnax tried to convince him with a detailed explanation of deep-sea pressure and the incredible strength required, to which Ned conceded that such a creature *would* need immense strength *if* it existed, but remained unconvinced of its reality.

The voyage was long. On June 30, Ned Land demonstrated his skill by harpooning two whales while assisting a whaler. On July 6, the *Abraham Lincoln* rounded Cape Horn and entered the Pacific, where the monster was last reported. For three months, the search was fruitless, leading to widespread discontent. Commander Farragut eventually promised to turn back for Europe if the monster didn't appear in three days (by November 5).

On the evening of November 5, with only hours left before the deadline, Ned Land suddenly shouted a sighting. The frigate stopped. An intense, inexplicable electric light emerged from the water, illuminating the sea. The object, described as the monster, darted around the *Abraham Lincoln* at twice its speed, enveloped it in luminous rings, then rushed at it, stopping abruptly before extinguishing its light and reappearing on the other side. Commander Farragut identified it as a gigantic, electric narwhal, deciding to wait for daylight to attack.

Around 1 AM, a deafening whistling sound was heard. At 2 AM, the light reappeared five miles away, accompanied by loud tail strokes and panting. At 8 AM, after a sea fog lifted, Ned Land sighted the blackish body, estimated at 250 feet long, a mile and a half away. Farragut ordered full steam, but the creature easily matched the frigate's speed (up to 19.3 miles/hour), circling it and darting away. A shot from the forecastle gun hit the animal but slid off its hard surface.

That evening, the monster reappeared, motionless. Farragut ordered a cautious approach. Ned Land, stationed under the bowsprit, threw his harpoon, striking a hard body. The electric light went out, and two enormous waterspouts broke over the frigate, throwing Aronnax into the sea.

In the water, Aronnax was saved by Conseil, who had followed him. Conseil reported the frigate's screw and rudder were broken. Exhausted, Aronnax then heard Ned Land's voice. Ned had landed on the ""gigantic narwhal"" itself, which he discovered was made of ""sheet iron."" Aronnax confirmed this, realizing the ""monster"" was a human-built submarine boat. The boat began to move. Soon, eight masked men emerged from a panel and forcibly took them inside.

Imprisoned in a dark, metal cabin, Ned Land was furious, but Conseil remained calm. The cabin was then lit by an intense electric light. Two men entered, one of whom was the chief. They did not understand French, English, German, or Latin. The men left, and a steward brought food: marine dishes without bread or wine. Aronnax noticed an engraved ""N"" with the motto ""MOBILIS IN MOBILI"" on the dinnerware, deducing ""N"" was the commander's initial. He felt reassured about their survival.

After a long sleep, Aronnax discovered that the boat renewed its air by surfacing, like a whale. Ned, starving and angry from the delay in food, attacked the steward when he finally appeared. The chief, speaking perfect French, intervened, revealing he understood all their languages and knew their identities. He explained that they had troubled his existence and, having attacked him and penetrated the ""secret of his whole existence,"" they would never leave his vessel. He offered them freedom to move about the ship, but under the condition of passive obedience if he needed to confine them, taking full responsibility for what they should not see. Ned Land refused to give his word of honor, but Aronnax accepted. The chief introduced himself as Captain Nemo and his vessel as the *Nautilus*.

Nemo gave Aronnax a tour. The *Nautilus* was elegantly furnished with a dining-room, a library of 12,000 books, and a museum filled with art and marine specimens, all collected by Nemo. He explained that electricity, generated from sodium extracted from sea-water, powered the vessel, providing light, heat, and motion. He described the *Nautilus*'s construction: a double-hulled, 232-foot-long cylinder, built secretly from parts sourced worldwide and assembled on a desert island. He revealed himself to be immensely rich, having acquired his wealth from the ocean. He showed Aronnax the navigation instruments, explaining how the manometer indicated depth, and how inclined planes and a rudder allowed vertical and horizontal movement. An electric reflector lit the depths. He confirmed the *Scotia* collision was accidental, but the *Abraham Lincoln* attack was in self-defense.

The *Nautilus* then surfaced, and Nemo took an astronomical observation. Aronnax realized they were in the North Pacific, following the warm ""Black River"" current. The saloon panels opened, revealing the vividly lit submarine world, an ""aquatic army"" of fish, a spectacle Ned Land and Conseil admired.

Days passed. On November 16, Nemo invited them to a hunting party on Crespo Island. He explained their special diving dresses, which provided breathable air for 9-10 hours, and air-guns that fired electric glass cases for lethal underwater hunting. Ned was disappointed to learn it was a *submarine* forest.

They donned their diving gear and stepped onto the seabed at 30 feet. They walked through a colorful coral kingdom and a submarine forest of rigid, perpendicular tree-plants. Aronnax felt an urge to sleep, a known diver's effect. He witnessed Nemo knocking over a monstrous sea-spider. They descended to 75 fathoms, where Nemo used his electric lamp to illuminate the increasingly dark depths. After four hours, they reached the base of Crespo Island. On the return, Nemo shot a valuable sea-otter and his companion shot an albatross. Later, Nemo urgently pushed Aronnax and Conseil to the ground as two formidable sharks (tintoreas) passed by, narrowly missing them. They safely returned to the *Nautilus*.

Later, the *Nautilus* passed over the wreck of the *Florida*, a disabled ship with corpses still on its deck, circled by sharks. Nemo stated, ""The earth does not want new continents, but new men.""

On December 27, the *Nautilus* arrived at Vanikoro, where La Perouse's expedition had been lost. Nemo recounted the full, tragic history of La Perouse's wreck and showed Aronnax a tin-plate box with Louis XVI's annotations, found at the site. Nemo then said, ""A coral tomb makes a quiet grave; and I trust that I and my comrades will find no other,"" adding ""of sharks and men."" This hinted at Nemo's profound defiance toward human society.

On January 4, 1868, the *Nautilus* reached the Papuan coasts, and Nemo announced his intention to enter the Indian Ocean via Torres Strait. While navigating the treacherous, reef-filled strait, the *Nautilus* ran aground on a rock near Gilboa Island. Nemo assured Aronnax it was an ""incident"" and promised the full moon's tide on January 9 would refloat them. Ned Land requested permission to go ashore, hoping to escape. Nemo granted it without demanding a promise of return. Aronnax, Ned, and Conseil landed on Gilboa Island, feasting on coconuts and bread-fruit. They discovered birds of paradise and hunted a hog and kangaroos. Their meal was interrupted by stones thrown by Papuan savages.

They fled back to the *Nautilus*. Aronnax found Captain Nemo playing his organ, seemingly unconcerned by the savages, stating the *Nautilus* had nothing to fear. The next morning, hundreds of Papuans gathered on the coral reef around the *Nautilus*. Aronnax and Conseil fished, finding a rare left-handed shell, which a native's stone broke. Conseil retaliated by shooting the native's arm. Canoes surrounded the *Nautilus*, showering it with arrows. Nemo, after calmly closing the hatches, revealed he had no intention of harming the ""poor creatures."" When the tide rose, and the Papuans attempted to board, Nemo activated an electric current through the handrail, repelling them. The *Nautilus* then sailed free from the Strait.

The *Nautilus* traveled at incredible speed, performing temperature experiments at various depths and witnessing a dazzling phosphorescent ""milk sea"" caused by infusoria. They passed through a dangerous area infested with sharks. On February 28, they neared Ceylon. Nemo invited them to a pearl fishery in the Gulf of Manaar, warning them of sharks. They donned diving suits, armed with daggers and Ned's harpoon. Underwater, they observed diverse marine life and the pearl oyster banks. Nemo led them to a grotto containing a gigantic tridacne (oyster) with a coconut-sized pearl, which he left to grow. They then observed an Indian pearl diver. A huge shark attacked the diver. Nemo, with astonishing courage, fought the shark with his dagger. Ned Land joined the fight, harpooning the shark, saving Nemo. Nemo then saved the Indian, giving him a bag of pearls. Back on board, Ned admitted he acted ""in revenge,"" and Nemo, with a ghastly smile, said the Indian was from an ""oppressed country"" and he would always be ""one of them.""

The *Nautilus* entered the Red Sea via the Arabian Tunnel, a natural subterranean passage under the Isthmus of Suez, which Nemo had discovered by observing identical fish in both seas. He praised M. Lesseps' Suez Canal but noted his own tunnel allowed the *Nautilus* to pass beneath the land. They passed Djeddah, then entered the Straits of Jubal, spotting Mount Horeb. Nemo took the helm to navigate the dark, deep tunnel, which precipitated Red Sea waters into the Mediterranean. In less than 20 minutes, they were in the Mediterranean.

Ned Land, seeing Europe nearby, became determined to escape, planning to use the pinnace under cover of night. Aronnax was torn between liberty and his unique scientific studies. He learned from Nemo that on May 15 (though the chronology is inconsistent with earlier dates in Part Two, this is the sequence given), they were in the Sargasso Sea, a vast floating meadow of seaweed. Nemo explained its formation and the accumulation of wrecks there. He stated that these deep-sea accumulations would one day become coal-mines. Nemo expressed his intent to continue his submarine program, likely heading to the Pacific via Cape Horn, making escape difficult for Ned. Aronnax tried to persuade Nemo to grant them liberty, but Nemo adamantly refused, reiterating that ""Whoever enters the *Nautilus*, must never quit it."" He stated he kept them on board not for pleasure but because they knew his secret, and he would not return them to the world. He was clearly driven by a deep-seated hatred for human society, acknowledging lost country, wife, children, father, and mother due to an ""oppressor.""

The *Nautilus* traversed the Mediterranean and entered the Atlantic. On June 1, off the coast of Spain, Nemo stopped the *Nautilus* at the bottom of Vigo Bay. He then revealed the historical account of the 1702 battle where Spanish galleons laden with gold and silver were sunk to prevent them from falling into enemy hands. He showed Aronnax how his crew were collecting these immense riches from the seabed, explaining this was the source of his vast wealth and that he used it to help ""oppressed races.""

The *Nautilus* continued south. One night, Nemo invited Aronnax on a night-time excursion. Without his companions or electric lamps, they walked on the Atlantic seabed at 150 fathoms, guided by a distant reddish glow. They explored a submarine forest and then encountered the ruins of a submerged city. Nemo, using chalk, wrote ""ATLANTIS"" on a rock, revealing they were on the lost continent. Nemo stood there in silent ecstasy, contemplating the ancient ruins lit by a submarine volcano.

The *Nautilus* then visited a secret underground harbor within an extinct volcano, where Nemo mined fossilized coal to produce sodium for his electricity. Ned Land and Conseil were able to collect honey from bees and bustards from this isolated ""land.""

The *Nautilus* then headed south, penetrating the Antarctic polar circle. On March 18, it became trapped by an ""interminable and immovable barrier"" of ice mountains. Nemo, defying Aronnax's doubts, declared they would go ""under"" the ice, using the *Nautilus*'s strength to create a passage. They descended deep beneath the iceberg. The *Nautilus* was struck by a falling ice block, becoming stranded on its side at 180 fathoms. Nemo calmly directed the crew to right the vessel and attempt to break through the ice. They worked for days with pickaxes, but the ice walls began to close in, threatening to crush them. With oxygen running low, Nemo ordered the injection of boiling water to prevent further solidification. Finally, he over-ballasted the *Nautilus*, causing it to sink and break through the remaining ice, allowing them to surface into open polar waters.

On March 21, 1868, Captain Nemo, M. Aronnax, and Conseil landed on an Antarctic island. Despite the fog, Nemo used his chronometer to determine their exact position at the South Pole, unfurling a black banner with a gold ""N"" and declaring possession in his own name. He bid farewell to the sun, which would now disappear for six months.

The *Nautilus* then sailed north. At 3 AM on March 22, a violent shock again caused the *Nautilus* to be stranded, lying on its side. Nemo revealed an enormous iceberg had turned over, pinning them. He explained the two dangers: being crushed or suffocating from lack of air. They only had two days of air left in the reservoirs. The crew worked with pickaxes to cut a trench in the ice. M. Aronnax joined in. The internal air became increasingly vitiated. Nemo tried a desperate measure: over-ballasting the *Nautilus* to break through the ice from below. After a terrifying fall, the *Nautilus* burst through the remaining ice, and pure air flooded the vessel.

Revived, they continued their journey, passing Cape Horn, Terra del Fuego, the Falkland Islands, and the coasts of Patagonia and Brazil. They crossed the Tropic of Capricorn and the Equator. One day, Conseil was shocked by a powerful electric fish (cumana). Aronnax observed manatees near the Amazon River mouth.

The *Nautilus* stayed off the American coast. On April 16, they sighted Martinique. Ned Land's desire for escape intensified, especially as they approached his native Canadian waters via the Gulf Stream. He confronted Nemo, demanding their liberty, but Nemo sternly refused, stating his decision was final. Aronnax, Ned, and Conseil continued to plan their escape. The *Nautilus* entered a violent hurricane in the Gulf Stream, which Nemo deliberately braved on the surface.

On June 1, the *Nautilus* located the wreck of the French ship *The Avenger*, sunk heroically in battle in 1794. The next day, a warship approached, firing upon the *Nautilus*, having apparently identified it as the feared submarine vessel. Nemo, transfigured by hatred and mourning his lost family, unfurled his black flag and vowed to sink the warship, declaring himself ""the law and the judge."" He ordered Aronnax and his companions below. As the *Nautilus* sank, Aronnax, Ned, and Conseil attempted to escape in the pinnace, but the panels closed, trapping them. The *Nautilus* then rammed the warship below its waterline, passing through it ""like a needle through sailcloth."" Aronnax watched in horror as the warship sank, its crew struggling and perishing in the eddy. Nemo, witnessing the destruction, then went to his room, where Aronnax saw a portrait of a woman and two children. Nemo knelt before it, sobbing, murmuring, ""Almighty God! enough! enough!""

The *Nautilus* sped northward at frightful speed. Aronnax felt horror for Nemo. Time became indistinct. Ned Land, completely disheartened, grew silent. One morning, Ned woke Aronnax, whispering they would fly that night. Land was visible 20 miles east. Aronnax agreed, preparing to leave. At 10 PM, as the moon had not risen, Aronnax crept through the dark *Nautilus*. He found Nemo in the saloon, playing the organ, again hearing his murmured lament, ""Almighty God! enough! enough!"" Rushing to the boat, Aronnax and his companions were about to cast off when loud shouts erupted: ""The maelstrom! the maelstrom!"" They realized the *Nautilus* was being drawn into the irresistible whirlpool off the coast of Norway. The boat, still attached, was carried with dizzying speed. A crashing noise, the bolts gave way, and their small boat was hurled into the maelstrom. Aronnax struck his head and lost consciousness.

The next thing Aronnax remembers is waking in a fisherman's hut on the Loffoden Isles, with Ned Land and Conseil safe beside him. He recounts his incredible 20,000-league voyage in under ten months. He wonders about the *Nautilus*'s fate: if it survived the maelstrom, if Captain Nemo still lives and continues his terrible retaliations, or if his hatred has finally been appeased, allowing him to become solely the ""philosopher"" of the sea. He concludes that only Captain Nemo and he have the right to answer the question: ""That which is far off and exceeding deep, who can find it out?"""
Ulysses-James Joyce,"The plot of the provided text, ""Ulysses,"" unfolds over a single day, June 16, 1904, primarily following the movements and thoughts of two main characters, Stephen Dedalus and Leopold Bloom, in Dublin, Ireland.

**Chapter I: Morning at the Martello Tower**
The narrative begins with Buck Mulligan, a medical student, appearing from a stairhead, carrying shaving gear and calling out to Stephen Dedalus, whom he refers to as ""Kinch."" Mulligan performs a mock blessing and teases Stephen, who is displeased and sleepy. They discuss a man named Haines, a ""ponderous Saxon"" who stayed with them and who Stephen finds alarming due to his nighttime ravings about shooting a black panther. Stephen expresses his fear and threat to leave the tower if Haines remains. Mulligan uses Stephen's handkerchief to wipe his razor, calling it ""snotgreen,"" and then gazes at Dublin Bay, speaking of the sea as a ""great sweet mother"" and the Greeks.

Mulligan reveals that his aunt believes Stephen killed his mother because Stephen refused to kneel and pray for her on her deathbed. Stephen experiences internal pain, recalling a dream of his deceased mother and the suffering of her last illness. Mulligan continues to tease Stephen about his clothing and past. He also mentions that a mutual acquaintance thinks Stephen has ""g.p.i."" (general paralysis of the insane). Stephen views a cracked mirror, calling it a ""symbol of Irish art."" Mulligan links arms with Stephen, apologizes for teasing, and talks about their shared Irish identity and Haines' wealth.

Stephen asks Mulligan to let Haines stay. Stephen then confronts Mulligan about a past insult regarding his mother's death, where Mulligan said, ""O, it’s only Dedalus whose mother is beastly dead."" Mulligan initially blushes but then dismisses the remark, arguing that death is a ""beastly thing"" and Stephen himself refused his mother's last wish. Stephen clarifies that the offense was to him, not his mother. Mulligan, exasperated, walks away, then calls Stephen to come down for breakfast, as Haines is apologizing for his behavior. Mulligan sings as he descends. Stephen, left alone, reflects on his mother's death and his decision not to sleep in the tower that night.

Downstairs in the tower's living room, Mulligan, Haines, and Stephen prepare breakfast. Mulligan complains about the smoke and the milkwoman. Stephen fetches items. The milkwoman arrives, and Mulligan makes a casual remark about ""the collector of prepuces."" Stephen buys milk and observes the old woman, reflecting on her as a ""wandering crone."" Mulligan makes loud comments about Irish living conditions, prompting the old woman to ask if he is a medical student. Haines speaks to her in Irish, which Mulligan notes is English. The old woman expresses shame for not knowing Irish. After calculating her bill, Mulligan gives her a florin, and Stephen adds that they still owe twopence.

Mulligan states he is ""stony"" and needs Stephen to collect his pay. Haines mentions visiting the National Library. Mulligan teases Stephen about his ""monthly wash."" Haines expresses interest in collecting Stephen's sayings, particularly the ""cracked lookingglass"" comment. Mulligan tells Haines to hear Stephen on Hamlet. Stephen questions the financial benefit. Mulligan scolds Stephen for bringing up money. Mulligan decides they should leave, discards his gown, dresses, and hands Stephen a ""Latin quarter hat."" Stephen locks the tower door and keeps the key.

Outside, Mulligan teases Stephen about the key. Haines asks about the tower's rent. Mulligan discusses Hamlet with Haines, claiming Stephen has an algebra proof that Hamlet's grandson is Shakespeare's grandfather. Mulligan then chants a blasphemous song about a divine ""queerest young fellow."" Haines finds Mulligan's gaiety amusing but blasphemous. Stephen confirms he has heard the ""ballad of joking Jesus"" many times. Haines discusses belief and a ""personal God,"" to which Stephen declares himself a ""horrible example of free thought."" Stephen reflects on Haines wanting his key and his current dependency on him. Haines remarks on Stephen's ability to be his ""own master,"" but Stephen claims to be a ""servant of two masters, an English and an Italian,"" adding a ""third"" for ""odd jobs,"" clarifying them as the British state and the Catholic Church. Haines comments on Ireland's history. Two men, a businessman and a boatman, observe a mailboat, mentioning a drowned man. Mulligan and the young man, Seymour, and an older man swim in the creek. Mulligan boasts about his ""Übermensch"" status after losing a ""twelfth rib."" Stephen decides to leave. Mulligan demands the key and twopence, which Stephen provides. Mulligan plunges into the water. Stephen leaves, reflecting on his mother and the sea, seeing a ""seal’s"" head in the water, thinking ""Usurper.""

**Chapter II: School and Deasy's Office**
Stephen teaches a history lesson on Pyrrhus to a class of boys. He makes an observation about Kingstown pier being a ""disappointed bridge."" He reflects on Haines and his own desire to ""pierce the polished mail of his mind."" The boys ask for a story, and one recites verses from Lycidas. Stephen mentally delves into philosophical concepts inspired by Aristotle. After the recitation, Stephen poses a riddle to the boys, which they cannot solve. He reveals the answer: ""The fox burying his grandmother under a hollybush.""

The boys eagerly leave for hockey. Sargent, a lingering student, asks Stephen to re-examine his sums. Stephen helps him, reflecting on Sargent's vulnerability and his own mother's protective love and painful death. After solving the problem, Stephen directs Sargent to join the others.

Stephen then enters Mr Deasy's study, where he waits while Mr Deasy attends to the hockey game. Mr Deasy returns and settles his financial accounts with Stephen, paying him three pounds twelve shillings. Mr Deasy advises Stephen on money, asserting ""Money is power"" and quoting Iago. Stephen reflects on his own debts. Mr Deasy then proudly declares the English boast is ""_I paid my way_."" He shares anecdotes about Irish history and his own lineage. He then asks Stephen to deliver a letter he wrote for the press concerning foot and mouth disease. Mr Deasy reveals his anti-Semitic views, claiming ""England is in the hands of the jews"" and ""Old England is dying."" Stephen challenges this briefly. Mr Deasy reiterates his view that Jews are ""wanderers on the earth"" due to their sin. Stephen responds, ""History... is a nightmare from which I am trying to awake."" Mr Deasy offers a theological perspective on human history moving towards God's manifestation, to which Stephen points to a ""shout in the street"" as God. Mr Deasy contrasts his happiness with Stephen's and blames women for bringing sin into the world, citing Helen and Parnell's downfall. He gives Stephen the letter to publish. As Stephen leaves, Mr Deasy calls him back to add that ""Ireland... has the honour of being the only country which never persecuted the jews"" because ""she never let them in.""

**Chapter III: Sandymount Strand**
Stephen walks alone on Sandymount Strand, contemplating philosophical ideas of perception and reality. He reflects on his own past, his family, and his artistic aspirations. He sees two women on the beach, associating them with midwives and birth. He then thinks of Kevin Egan in Paris, recalling conversations about French socialism and the telegram announcing his mother's death. Stephen's internal monologue drifts to thoughts of his dead mother and the pain of memory. He finds a cracked mirror, given to him by Mulligan, and reflects on it as a symbol of Irish art. He thinks of the futility of his literary ambition and his desire for a ""touch"" from a woman. He lies on rocks, observing the sea and considering the drowned man mentioned earlier. He then sees a man and a woman with a dog. The dog digs, reminiscent of Stephen's riddle. Stephen then recalls a dream of a ""street of harlots"" and a mysterious man. He thinks of a coarse poem and the contrast between ""monkwords"" and ""roguewords."" He writes ""Mouth to her mouth’s kiss"" on his notebook, later tearing off the blank end of Deasy's letter to jot down notes. He reflects on his shadow and his desire for his words to be read. He fantasizes about a ""lady of letters"" and about being touched. He lies back, watching the sun, thinking of past loves and Cranly. He observes the tide, the weeds, and reflects on death and the physical body's decay, noting how ""God becomes man becomes fish."" He thinks of buying a handkerchief. He sees a three-masted ship sailing silently.

**Chapter IV: Bloom's Morning**
Mr Leopold Bloom prepares breakfast for his wife, Molly. He enjoys eating animal organs, particularly mutton kidneys. He talks to his cat, gives her milk, and reflects on her nature. He goes upstairs to check on Molly, who is still in bed. He tells her he's going out briefly and asks about her breakfast, to which she grunts. He finds his latchkey is in his other trousers and decides not to disturb her.

He walks through the streets, observing the breadvan and imagining exotic travels. He passes Larry O'Rourke's pub and greets the owner, thinking about the financial aspects of pubs. He stops at a pork butcher's, observing sausages and a young woman at the counter, whose figure he admires. He buys a pork kidney and notices a printed flyer about a model farm in Palestine, sparking thoughts of agricultural ventures and his Jewish heritage, which quickly turn to images of desolation and the ""dead sea.""

He returns home and finds letters for Molly and one for himself, addressed to ""Henry Flower Esq."" He reads Milly's letter, which thanks him for a birthday present, discusses her photography job in Mullingar, and mentions a student named Bannon who sings Blazes Boylan's song. Molly's letter is from Boylan. Molly asks about the funeral time and for the meaning of ""metempsychosis,"" which Bloom explains as transmigration of souls. He realizes he has left the kidney burning on the fire. He rescues it, slightly burnt, and brings Molly her tea. He rereads Milly's letter, reflecting on his daughter's growing independence and the pain of his deceased son, Rudy. He thinks of Molly's tomboy nature and his own feelings of inadequacy.

He then goes to the outhouse to relieve himself, reading a story in _Titbits_. He reflects on the story's moral ending and the payment the author received. He considers writing a similar piece. He tears a page from the _Titbits_ to wipe himself. After dressing, he hears the bells of George's church tolling ""Quarter to."" He thinks ""Poor Dignam!""

**Chapter V: The Funeral Procession**
Bloom walks along Sir John Rogerson’s Quay, heading towards Dignam's funeral. He sees a boy and girl from the poor section of town. He passes an undertaker's and reflects on Corny Kelleher. He stops at a tea company window, takes off his hat, and covertly checks the letter addressed to ""Henry Flower Esq."" from Martha Clifford, which he had placed in his hat.

He encounters M'Coy, who asks about Molly and informs Bloom of Paddy Dignam's sudden death, requesting Bloom to add his name to the funeral attendees list if he cannot make it. Bloom agrees, though inwardly annoyed. Bloom sees Blazes Boylan, who is involved in Molly's upcoming concert tour. Bloom reflects on Molly's success and his own complex feelings about her and Boylan.

He opens Martha's letter, which contains a yellow flower. Martha expresses anger about stamps he sent, calls him a ""naughty boy,"" and wants to meet him, asking about his wife's perfume. Bloom puts the flower in his pocket, reading the letter. He thinks about their correspondence and Martha's desire for a relationship. He later tears up the envelope containing her address.

He passes a cabman's shelter, humming an opera tune. He enters All Hallows Church, observing a sodality mass and reflecting on religious rituals and beliefs, including confession and the Eucharist. He notes the priest's actions and the congregation's piety. He also considers the financial aspects of the church. He stands among the kneeling worshippers, discreetly placing his hat on his knee and his newspaper beneath him.

He thinks about the priest's previous life. After the mass, he leaves the church. He stops at a chemist's shop to order a skin lotion for Molly, recalling her delicate skin and his own desire for a bath. He encounters Bantam Lyons, who asks to see his newspaper. Bloom, wanting to get rid of him, offers him the paper, saying he was ""just going to throw it away."" Lyons, misinterpreting this as a racing tip, takes the paper.

Bloom continues towards the public baths, thinking of cleanliness and his body. He imagines himself naked in a bath.

**Chapter VI: The Funeral Carriage**
Bloom joins a funeral carriage with Martin Cunningham, Mr Power, and Simon Dedalus, en route to Paddy Dignam's burial. He is the last to enter. He feels the soap still in his hip pocket. They discuss the deceased and the custom of funerals. As they pass through Ringsend, Bloom points out Stephen Dedalus walking alone, referring to him as Simon's ""son and heir."" Simon Dedalus expresses anger at Buck Mulligan's negative influence on Stephen. Bloom reflects on his own deceased son, Rudy, and his longing for a son.

They discuss the crowded carriage and crumbs found on the seats, jokes are made. They stop at the Grand Canal. Bloom observes a horse pulling a sweeper and reflects on sickness and death. The weather turns. Martin Cunningham tells a story about Tom Kernan. Bloom surreptitiously consults his newspaper, seeing Dignam's obituary. He checks for Martha's letter. They pass various Dublin landmarks, including the Queen's Theatre.

They see Blazes Boylan, and Mr Dedalus salutes him. Bloom examines his fingernails, feeling a sense of inadequacy compared to Boylan, who is having an affair with Molly. Mr Power asks Bloom about Molly's concert tour, and Bloom, to avoid revealing Boylan's involvement, invents a business trip to County Clare. They pass by statues and discuss various acquaintances and rumors. Martin Cunningham whispers to Mr Power that Bloom's father committed suicide, which surprises Mr Power.

Bloom asks about Dignam's insurance, and they discuss his five children. Simon Dedalus weeps for his deceased wife. They reach the cemetery and enter the mortuary chapel, where the coffin is laid out. Bloom kneels on his newspaper. A priest performs the service. Bloom mentally critiques the Latin and the practice of communion. He feels a pain in his kneecap. He reflects on the priest's monotonous duty and the universality of death.

After the service, gravediggers prepare the grave. The mourners proceed to the graveside. They discuss Parnell's grave and the legend that he is not truly buried there. Bloom thinks about the cost of burials and the inefficiency of the system. Hynes asks Bloom's full name and asks for M'Coy's to be added to his notebook. Bloom also notices a mysterious ""man in the macintosh,"" whom he counts as the thirteenth person at the grave. Bloom questions where Hynes got the information about M'Coy. The coffin is lowered. Bloom turns away as the clay falls, reflecting on the finality of death. He then sees Hynes writing in his notebook and is asked his name and M'Coy's again. Bloom mentions the man in the macintosh, who then mysteriously disappears.

The mourners move away. Bloom reflects on the caretaker, John O'Connell, who tells a joke about a drunk mistaking a statue for a man. Bloom thinks about the ""fat"" soil of the cemetery and the ""deathmoths."" He ponders the idea of cremation and the different ways people deal with death. He sees the cemetery gates, ready to return to the world. He encounters John Henry Menton, whose hat is dented. Bloom points this out, but Menton responds curtly. Bloom feels slighted but reflects that ""Thank you. How grand we are this morning!""

**Chapter VII: Newspaper Office**
Trams clatter around Nelson's Pillar. Shoeblacks and mail cars operate near the General Post Office. Draymen roll barrels of Guinness. Bloom enters the _Freeman_ newspaper office, where Red Murray is working. Bloom hands Murray a clipping of an advertisement for Alexander Keyes, asking him to prepare it for the _Telegraph_. He then explains that Keyes wants a specific design with two crossed keys, symbolizing ""the House of Keys"" (Manx parliament) and home rule, and a promotional paragraph. The foreman, Nannetti, agrees to the design and paragraph in exchange for a three-month renewal of the ad.

While waiting, Bloom is distracted by the sounds and sights of the printing press. He reflects on the process of printing, on his earlier conversation with Mr Deasy, and on the death notices in the paper, including Paddy Dignam's. He also thinks of the newspaper's commercial side and his own ideas for advertisements. He sees old Monks, the ""dayfather"" (proofreader). He briefly considers his past, including his father's Jewish heritage and the custom of reading backwards.

Bloom then overhears a conversation between Professor MacHugh, Simon Dedalus, and Ned Lambert in the _Evening Telegraph_ office. They are discussing a flowery speech by Dan Dawson about ""Our lovely land,"" which they find bombastic and mock. J. J. O'Molloy enters, looking pale and burdened, and is thought to be in decline. The conversation continues, touching on Roman civilization and its ""cloacal obsession"" versus Greek intellect.

Stephen Dedalus arrives with Mr O'Madden Burke, bringing Mr Deasy's letter about foot and mouth disease. The editor, Myles Crawford, dismisses Deasy as an ""old pelters"" and recalls a crude anecdote about Deasy's wife. Professor MacHugh discusses Ireland's loyalty to ""lost causes"" and praises the Greek language. Lenehan, a joker, tells a limerick about Professor MacHugh and then reveals the answer to his riddle: ""The Rose of Castile"" (rows of cast steel).

The group discusses various topics: Professor Magennis's opinion of Stephen's ""hermetic crowd,"" the editor's request for Stephen to write a biting article, and Ignatius Gallaher's famous journalism coup related to the Phoenix Park murders. Bloom overhears much of this, including the editor's crude dismissal of him when he tries to phone about Keyes's ad. The conversation then turns to the ""persecution"" of Jews, a topic Bloom finds deeply sensitive.

Stephen outlines his idea for a story, ""A Pisgah Sight of Palestine or The Parable of The Plums,"" about two old women climbing Nelson's pillar. The editor and professor find this ""copy."" Myles Crawford, becoming agitated, tells Bloom to tell Keyes he can ""kiss my arse"" regarding the ad. Bloom, weighing his options, decides to continue trying to secure the ad. The chapter ends with the group heading to Mooney's pub.

**Chapter VIII: Bloom's Wanderings**
Bloom walks past Graham Lemon's, receiving an Elijah throwaway, which makes him think of religious zealots and his father's past. He sees Dilly Dedalus outside Dillon's auctionrooms, reminding him of his fragmented family. He crosses O'Connell Bridge, observing the brewery barge and gulls. He throws Banbury cakes to the gulls, reflecting on their greed and the nature of poets. He notices a boat with an advertisement for ""Kino's Trousers,"" pondering the commercial world. He recalls Molly's mispronunciation of ""metempsychosis"" as ""met him pike hoses.""

He passes sandwich-board men advertising H.E.L.Y.'S and reflects on advertising strategies and the historical context of the firm. He remembers his own past ideas for innovative advertisements and his interactions with nuns while collecting accounts. He recalls Molly's early life and their romantic moments, including a time she laughed at the wind, almost getting him caught in a compromising position.

He meets Mrs Breen, who informs him that her husband, Denis, is pursuing a libel case for ten thousand pounds over a postcard with ""U. p: up"" written on it. She also tells him that Mina Purefoy is in the lying-in hospital, in difficult labor for three days. Bloom expresses sympathy. He observes Cashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, a eccentric figure, and Denis Breen himself, laden with lawbooks.

Bloom enters a bookshop, where he peruses cheap erotic novels, choosing one titled ""_Sweets of Sin_."" He reads a passage from it, which stirs his own sexual desires and fantasies of Molly. He is then interrupted by the shopman, a crude, coughing figure, and purchases the book.

He sees Dilly Dedalus again, who asks him for money. He gives her a shilling and two pennies, reflecting on his own father's stinginess and his daughters' demands. He contemplates the difficulties of Dilly's life.

Later, he encounters Father Cowley and Simon Dedalus. Father Cowley explains he is being pursued by a ""gombeen man"" (moneylender) named Reuben J. Dodd and needs Ben Dollard's help. Ben Dollard arrives, and the men discuss his financial troubles and past success as a singer.

The viceregal cavalcade passes through the city. Many characters from earlier chapters briefly appear, observing the procession and reflecting on their own lives and positions in Dublin society. Blazes Boylan, stylish and confident, is seen with a red carnation, explicitly linked to Molly and her upcoming concert. Patrick Aloysius Dignam, Paddy's son, is also seen, having been sent for porksteaks and reflecting on his father's death.

Bloom finds a quiet spot and opens his newly acquired book, _Sweets of Sin_, and also glances at _The Awful Disclosures of Maria Monk_ and _Aristotle’s Masterpiece_. He reads a sexually explicit passage from _Sweets of Sin_, which further ignites his fantasies about Molly and other women.

**Chapter IX: National Library**
Stephen Dedalus is at the National Library, discussing Shakespeare with John Eglinton, A. E. (Russell), and Mr Best. The discussion centers on Hamlet and Shakespeare's life, including his marriage to Anne Hathaway and the ""dark lady"" of the sonnets. Stephen presents a complex, idiosyncratic theory that Shakespeare himself is the ghost of Hamlet's father, and that the play is an allegory for Shakespeare's personal life and his ""dispossessed son."" He argues that Shakespeare's genius lay in transforming his own experiences of infidelity and loss into art.

The conversation is interjected with other characters' comments and Lenehan's limerick and riddle (""The Rose of Castile,"" meaning ""rows of cast steel""). Professor MacHugh delivers a speech contrasting Roman material civilization with Greek intellectualism. Myles Crawford, the editor, is present, seeking a ""biting"" article from Stephen. He recounts Ignatius Gallaher's journalistic triumph in reporting the Phoenix Park murders.

Bloom enters the library, having been told by the editor to ""go to hell"" when he tried to phone about Keyes's advertisement earlier. He finds the discussion about Shakespeare and art somewhat remote. He notes the presence of other men, particularly Mr O'Madden Burke, and a sense of ""lost causes.""

Stephen continues to expound on his Hamlet theory, delving into Shakespeare's brothers and the ""original sin"" that darkened his understanding, leading to themes of usurpation and adultery in his plays. He describes fatherhood as a ""mystical estate"" and ""legal fiction."" Mulligan arrives, having received Stephen's telegram about his payment, and mocks Stephen's ""sentimentalist"" nature, revealing Stephen's financial difficulties and his aunt's concern. Mulligan then reveals his own ""play"" idea, ""Everyman His Own Wife,"" a ""national immorality in three orgasms.""

As Bloom passes through the library, he is observed by Mulligan, who whispers to Stephen that Bloom is ""the wandering jew"" and ""looked upon you to lust after you."" Mulligan mocks Bloom's ""pale Galilean eyes"" and his supposed attraction to the ""foamborn Aphrodite."" The conversation shifts to Penelope and the sonnets, with Stephen asserting that Shakespeare was a ""spurned lover."" He argues that Anne Hathaway's infidelity and subsequent financial arrangements are reflected in Shakespeare's will, which left her his ""secondbest bed.""

Stephen continues to argue for his theory, connecting Shakespeare's life to his plays and discussing various historical figures. Mulligan continues to interject with bawdy comments and cynical humor. Bloom's ""jewishness"" and ""perverted"" nature are alluded to. The chapter concludes with Mulligan and Stephen leaving the library, with Mulligan teasing Stephen and Stephen reflecting on the ""shattering daylight of no thought.""

**Chapter X: Dublin Street Scenes**
The narrative follows various Dubliners as they go about their day. Father John Conmee, a Jesuit, walks from his presbytery, contemplating his upcoming visit to Artane and recalling Father Bernard Vaughan's sermons. He blesses a one-legged sailor and encounters Mrs Sheehy, exchanging pleasantries. He gives a letter to a schoolboy, Brunny Lynam, to post. He passes Mr Denis J. Maginni, a dancing professor, and Mrs M'Guinness, a pawnbroker. He reflects on ""Invincible ignorance"" and the importance of a tramline on North Circular Road. He smells incense near St Joseph's church and thinks of a nobleman. He passes various shops and observes a turfbarge, reflecting on God's providence. He boards a tram for Dollymount.

Meanwhile, other scenes unfold: Katey and Boody Dedalus are in their kitchen, hungry and complaining about not being able to pawn books. Their sister Dilly has gone to meet their father. They eat peasoup provided by Sister Mary Patrick.

Blazes Boylan is in a fruit shop, selecting fruit and a bottle of wine, which he sends by tram to an invalid. He flirts with the blond shop girl, putting a red carnation in his mouth.

Stephen is with Almidano Artifoni, an Italian singing teacher, who advises Stephen to cultivate his voice for financial gain. Stephen politely deflects him, noting the passing of Highland soldiers.

Miss Dunne, a typist, is in her office, typing and reflecting on a novel and the upcoming band concert. She receives a phone call, confirming appointments for Mr Boylan at the Ormond Hotel.

Ned Lambert and J. J. O'Molloy are at St Mary's Abbey, a historic site, with a clergyman, Hugh C. Love, who is researching the Fitzgeralds. Ned Lambert recounts the story of the Earl of Kildare setting fire to Cashel cathedral.

Tom Rochford demonstrates his invention, a turn indicator for tables, to Nosey Flynn and Paddy Leonard at a pub. Lenehan, having placed a bet on ""Throwaway,"" which has won, tells M'Coy about Tom Rochford's heroic act of rescuing a man from a manhole. They pass Marie Kendall's poster. They see Bloom at a hawker's cart. Lenehan makes a joke about Bloom's name.

The viceregal cavalcade, led by the Earl of Dudley, proceeds through the city. Many characters, including Simon Dedalus, Richie Goulding, John Wyse Nolan, Gerty MacDowell, Mr Denis J. Maginni, and Blazes Boylan, observe and react to the procession. Boylan, in particular, is noted for his stylish attire and his red carnation. The chapter ends with Boylan's jaunty walk and the music of highland laddies playing.

**Chapter XI: Ormond Hotel**
The chapter opens with a description of the sounds and sights inside the Ormond Hotel bar, focusing on Miss Douce and Miss Kennedy, two barmaids. They observe the viceregal cavalcade passing by. Miss Douce flirts with a passing man, Mr Bloom, who is trying to avoid being seen by Blazes Boylan. They discuss men and laugh. Bloom passes by, carrying his purchased book, _Sweets of Sin_, and is tormented by lustful thoughts.

The two barmaids continue their conversation, discussing their suntans and the ""hideous old wretch"" (presumably an old man who harassed them). They gossip about men and Boylan. Lenehan enters, asking if Boylan was looking for him. He makes a crude joke about a fox and a stork. Simon Dedalus enters, asks for a drink, and discusses his ""famous son"" Stephen with Lenehan, who exaggerates Stephen's intellectual prowess.

The piano tuner has been in, and Miss Douce praises his playing. Bloom, outside, reflects on his letter to Martha, which he is still composing in his head. He plans to buy paper at Daly's. He sees a gay hat on a jaunting car, recognizing Boylan.

Boylan arrives at the Ormond bar. Lenehan greets him enthusiastically, announcing Boylan as a ""conquering hero."" Bloom, still avoiding direct interaction, observes from a distance. Boylan orders drinks and asks about a horse race, confirming he bet on Sceptre. Miss Douce flirts with Boylan, who pays with a coin. She rings the cash register.

Richard Goulding enters with Bloom in tow, heading to the dining room. Bloom takes a table near the door. Boylan, waiting for his drinks, notices Bloom and calls out to him, asking about Molly. Bloom deflects, saying Molly is in her bath. Boylan, ignoring Bloom's discomfort, goes off.

Ben Dollard, Father Cowley, and Simon Dedalus are in the saloon. Ben Dollard sings ""When love absorbs my ardent soul."" They joke and discuss music and their past. Bloom enters the dining room with Richie Goulding, where they eat. Bloom reflects on the irony of Richie's admiration for Simon's singing, given their estranged relationship.

Bloom listens to Simon sing ""M'appari."" He is moved by the music and the associated memories of Molly. He attempts to write a letter to Martha, his thoughts weaving between the song, his secret correspondence, and his desire for Molly. He decides to send Martha a postal order for two and six. He writes the address and reflects on the duality of his life.

Ben Dollard sings ""The Croppy Boy,"" a patriotic ballad. Bloom listens, reflecting on the song's themes of martyrdom and loss. He also thinks of his own ""lost"" son, Rudy. The performance moves the listeners, but Bloom is also thinking of the practicalities of money and his physical discomfort. He sees the barmaids, Miss Douce and Miss Kennedy, observing him. He notices his sweat.

As the music continues, Bloom's thoughts become more fragmented, intertwining music, sex, memory, and personal desires. He reflects on women, their bodies, and their power. He notes the sounds of the city, both musical and mundane. He then remembers the ""mermaid"" poster and Boylan.

Bloom gets up to leave, passing the barmaids. He hears their conversations and their reactions to the music. He sees Boylan leave, his jaunting car jingling. Bloom feels a sense of loneliness. He passes Pat, the deaf waiter, who has been listening.

The music shifts, with Bob Cowley playing. Ben Dollard continues singing. Bloom continues to reflect on music, love, and loss. He notices the barmaids, their beauty, and their reactions to the men around them. He thinks of his watch and the time.

The chapter ends with Bloom's reflections on the ""coolest whiff"" of a mermaid on a poster and his decision to leave, walking towards his next destination.

**Chapter XII: Barney Kiernan's Pub**
The chapter is narrated by an unnamed character (the ""Citizen"") in a highly colloquial and nationalistic style, often incorporating fantastical and exaggerated descriptions. The narrator is in Barney Kiernan's pub with Joe Hynes. He recounts an earlier encounter with a ""bloody foxy thief"" named Geraghty and his attempts to collect a debt. He then introduces the ""citizen,"" a fierce Irish nationalist, sitting in the corner with his dog, Garryowen.

Joe Hynes and the narrator join the Citizen. They discuss the ""times,"" and the Citizen blames ""foreign wars"" while Joe Hynes attributes tyranny to ""the Russians."" The narrator complains of thirst. Joe orders three pints, and the Citizen passionately speaks of Ireland. He almost throttles his dog while asking if they will win.

The Citizen is described in an epic, exaggerated manner as a ""broadshouldered deepchested stronglimbed frankeyed redhaired freelyfreckled shaggybearded widemouthed largenosed longheaded deepvoiced barekneed brawnyhanded hairylegged ruddyfaced sinewyarmed hero,"" wearing oxhide and deerskin, adorned with ""seastones"" engraved with Irish heroes.

Joe Hynes pays for the drinks with a sovereign he got from a ""prudent member."" The narrator mentions seeing Bloom earlier. The Citizen criticizes the ""subsidised organ,"" the _Irish Independent_, for its English news, reading out birth and death notices. Joe Hynes and Alf Bergan arrive. Alf makes fun of Denis Breen, who is pursuing a libel action over a postcard with ""U. p: up"" on it. Bob Doran, already drunk, joins the conversation.

Alf Bergan then shows ""hangman's letters"" he has, discussing capital punishment. Bloom enters the pub and is also drawn into the discussion. He gives a scientific explanation for a hanged man's erection, which the Citizen and others find offensive and confusing. The Citizen then launches into a passionate speech about Irish nationalism, the Fenians, and the injustice of English rule. Bloom tries to interject with more moderate views, leading to an argument.

The conversation shifts to Irish sports versus ""shoneen games"" (English sports). Bloom argues against violent exercise, which the narrator finds verbose. Alf Bergan recounts the boxing match between Myler Keogh and Sergeant-Major Bennett, vividly describing the brutal fight. He then mentions Blazes Boylan's concert tour and his involvement with Molly Bloom.

J. J. O'Molloy and Ned Lambert join the group. They discuss legal matters and the Breen libel case. The Citizen continues his anti-English tirade, criticizing their ""syphilisation"" and lack of art and literature. Lenehan, having won money on ""Throwaway,"" reveals he put Boylan off his own racing tip, Sceptre. The Citizen, Joe, and Lenehan discuss the unfairness of the race.

The Citizen, John Wyse Nolan, and Lenehan discuss the ""lost tribes"" of Ireland, its ruined trade and industries. They bemoan the destruction of Irish forests and the need for reafforestation. The narrative then shifts to an elaborate, satirical description of an international wedding of ""the chevalier Jean Wyse de Neaulan"" with ""Miss Fir Conifer of Pine Valley,"" featuring many tree-themed guests and a musical performance.

The Citizen continues to praise Ireland's past trade with Spain and France, envisioning a future with Irish battleships. The narrator then shifts to a crude description of the Citizen's bluster. The discussion moves to the British navy and corporal punishment. The Citizen vehemently condemns England's ""empire of drudges and whipped serfs."" Bloom again attempts to introduce moderation, speaking of ""universal love,"" which the Citizen dismisses as hypocrisy.

The Citizen reads another satirical article about an African chief's visit to England and the ""Black and White"" toast. They discuss Belgian atrocities in the Congo. Lenehan reveals Bloom's earlier bet on ""Throwaway"" and that he has gone to collect his winnings. The narrator, in an aside, describes his own visit to the outhouse and his reflections on Bloom's cunning.

Back in the pub, the Citizen, John Wyse, and Joe Hynes accuse Bloom of being behind Sinn Fein, of being a ""robbing bagman"" like his father. Martin Cunningham and Jack Power arrive, confirming some of the rumors about Bloom. The Citizen, full of rage, curses Bloom, calling him a ""wolf in sheep’s clothing"" and ""Ahasuerus.""

The narrative then launches into another elaborate, fantastical description, this time of a procession of saints, martyrs, virgins, and confessors, led by Father O'Flynn, blessing Barney Kiernan's pub. All pray together.

Bloom returns, trying to seem casual. The Citizen accuses him of defrauding widows and orphans. Joe Hynes confirms Bloom put his name down for money. The Citizen grows furious, accusing Bloom of ""swindling the peasants"" and bringing ""Saxon robbers"" to Ireland. Bloom tries to explain, but the Citizen becomes increasingly agitated.

Alf Bergan shows a ""smutty yankee picture."" John Wyse Nolan and Lenehan enter, discussing the Irish language. The Citizen, in an exaggerated display of patriotism, drinks ale and curses the English. Lenehan reveals ""Throwaway"" won the Gold Cup at twenty to one and that Boylan lost his bet on Sceptre.

The Citizen's rage escalates as he criticizes Bloom's ""love"" philosophy. A long, surreal passage describes ""love"" in its many forms. The Citizen then quotes another satirical piece about a Zulu chief visiting England.

Lenehan reveals Bloom's betting win. The narrator describes his own trip to the outhouse and his thoughts about Bloom's duplicity.

Back in the pub, the Citizen accuses Bloom's family of frauds. Martin Cunningham arrives, confirming Bloom is a ""perverted jew"" and his father changed his name from Virag to Bloom. The Citizen proclaims Bloom the ""new Messiah for Ireland."" The group discusses the Jewish expectation of a Messiah and Bloom's past actions, including buying baby food before Rudy's birth.

The Citizen proposes a final toast. The narrative then shifts to a final, grand, and highly exaggerated depiction of a procession of saints and clergy blessing the pub, all praising God and Ireland. Bloom, returning, is caught in the midst of this.

The Citizen's rage reaches its peak. He calls Bloom a ""bloody jewman"" and tries to throw a biscuitbox at him. The narrative then transforms into a fantastical, apocalyptic description of Dublin, with an earthquake, demolished buildings, and a celestial ascent of ""ben Bloom Elijah."" The Citizen throws the biscuitbox, narrowly missing Bloom, who escapes in a jaunting car. The Citizen yells at his dog to pursue.

**Chapter XIII: Nausicaa**
The scene shifts to Sandymount Strand in the evening. Gerty MacDowell, a young woman with a slight limp, sits on the rocks with her two friends, Cissy Caffrey and Edy Boardman, and the Boardman baby and Cissy's twin brothers, Tommy and Jacky. The children play with a ball and build sandcastles. Cissy is portrayed as lively and maternal, Edy as somewhat critical. Gerty, described as beautiful but fragile and melancholic, observes a man (unnamed, but implied to be Bloom) sitting alone further down the beach.

Gerty fantasizes about a romantic encounter, yearning for a manly man to understand and comfort her. She reflects on her ""gnawing sorrow,"" her unfulfilled dreams of marriage, and her secret love for ""Reggy Wylie,"" who is now engaged to another. She also thinks of her father, a victim of drink, and her own role as a ""second mother"" in the household.

The children's play leads to their ball rolling near the seated gentleman. Gerty, conscious of his gaze, performs a deliberate kick of the ball, subtly raising her skirt to display her legs and stockings. She feels a ""burning scarlet"" flush across her face as she exchanges glances with the man, sensing his admiration and a ""whitehot passion."" She believes he is her ""dreamhusband"" and that she could heal his ""haunting sorrow.""

The sound of an organ and singing from a nearby church—a men's temperance retreat—intertwines with Gerty's thoughts. She reflects on the ""demon drink"" that ruined her father and her desire for a different life. She wishes for him to be a married man or a widower, not a ""fallen woman."" She imagines a chaste, supportive relationship.

The children's squabbling brings them back to reality. Cissy runs after the ball, deliberately showing her legs to the man, while Gerty secretly watches his reaction. Gerty asserts her independence by proclaiming it's ""leap year"" and she can ""throw my cap at who I like,"" a subtle jab at Edy's jealousy.

The benediction in the church concludes, marked by the chiming of bells and the flight of a bat. Gerty continues to fantasize about the man, imagining a future with him, filled with poetry and love. She thinks of her physical ""shortcoming"" (her limp) which she tries to conceal.

As the other girls gather their things to leave, Cissy asks the gentleman for the time. He apologetically states his watch is stopped but he believes it is after eight. Gerty, again, feels his intense gaze and believes he is ""literally worshipping at her shrine."" She feels a ""sensation rushing all over her"" and acknowledges his unspoken admiration.

The girls leave, and Gerty, in a ""pathetic little glance,"" parts from the man, who is revealed to be Leopold Bloom. Bloom, recognizing her limp, reflects on her ""jilted beauty"" and the cruelty of society. He thinks of her ""crazy longings"" and his own ""dirty bracegirdle"" thoughts. He thinks of Molly and his letter to Martha. He muses on the universality of women's desires and the ""secret"" of their attraction. He thinks of the ""magnetic influence"" between people.

He reflects on the perfume he smells, associating it with Molly and her ""high notes and her low notes."" He thinks of the female body and the secrets women keep. He feels a ""benignant persistent ache in his footsoles."" He picks at his toenail, inhaling its odor, finding satisfaction in the ritual. He looks for a handkerchief he lost.

He notes the night is growing dark, with dew falling. He wonders if he should go home. He reflects on his past relationships and the ""monkey puzzle rocket"" of fireworks that burst, leading to his vision of Gerty. He acknowledges his own ""midsummer madness"" and the ""language"" they shared. He thinks of his own name and his daughter Milly, and his dead son Rudy. He reflects on the human condition, comparing it to animals. He thinks of the cycle of birth and death, and his need for a bath.

He sees a bat flying and hears a bell chime. He leans, breathing, and the sound of ""Cuckoo"" repeats, symbolizing the passage of time and the lingering presence of Gerty MacDowell in his mind.

**Chapter III: Molly's Soliloquy**
(Note: This chapter is a stream of consciousness from Molly Bloom and, as such, depicts her internal thoughts, memories, and desires rather than external action. I will summarize these internal events.)

Molly's thoughts begin in bed, reflecting on Bloom's unusual request for breakfast in bed. She remembers Mrs Riordan, a miserly, pious old woman who lived with them, and her negative qualities. She contrasts this with Bloom's kindness to old women and beggars. She mentally reviews Bloom's recent behavior, suspecting he's been with another woman or a ""little bitch."" She recalls finding a letter he was writing, which he covered up, leading her to believe he's infatuated with someone who sees him as a ""softy."" She's not bothered by his infidelity but curious, and resents not having his attention. She thinks about his past attempts to flirt with her and his clumsiness.

She reflects on her own attractiveness, on being ""on the pop of asking"" Bloom about their intimate moments. She thinks of Boylan, his touch, and her secret desire for him. She wonders if she should arrange for a handsome young man to pay attention to her, thinking about her new garters and the effect they would have. She thinks about the ""coalman"" and a ""bishop,"" and the idea of making a ""whore"" of herself. She dismisses Bloom's age and his lack of sexual satisfaction.

Molly recalls her first sexual encounter with a man named Mulvey in Gibraltar when she was fifteen. She remembers her youth, the beauty of the landscape, and the physical sensations of their kiss. She thinks of her mixed heritage (Spanish and Irish). She recalls the Spanish cavalry and the beauty of the horses. She dreams of Boylan and the concert tour, contrasting him with Bloom. She remembers Bloom's past attempts to get her involved in various schemes, including singing. She thinks of her own family, especially her father, Major Brian Tweedy.

She reflects on her physical attributes, particularly her breasts, and the male gaze. She ponders the reason for her sexual desires and the ""big hole in the middle of us."" She recalls the difficult birth of Milly and the death of Rudy, her only son. She considers the constant demands of children and the selfishness of men. She thinks about the ""dirty bitches"" who come after men and the hypocrisy of society.

Molly's thoughts drift to her own physical needs and discomforts, particularly her menstrual cycle. She recalls a past concert where she was uncomfortable, thinking of a ""gentleman of fashion"" staring at her. She criticizes Bloom's lack of understanding about women's bodies and their emotional needs. She thinks about the various men who have desired her, including a young student, and her own power to attract. She recalls a time she made Bloom blush.

She fantasizes about taking a lover, perhaps a sailor or a gypsy. She dismisses the idea of a servant. She thinks about the ""cracked ideas"" of Bloom and his friends, particularly their discussions about religion and atheism. She recalls their early days together, their apartment, and Bloom's attempts to ""civilize"" her. She remembers her own rebellious nature and her desire for freedom.

She thinks about the ongoing affair with Boylan, how Bloom doesn't know. She believes she could get Bloom to make up with her, but she doesn't truly want it. She imagines him following her, jealous. She recalls her own flirtatious behavior and her deliberate attempts to provoke male attention. She thinks about her appearance, her clothes, and the effect they have on men.

Molly's thoughts return to the present moment in bed. She feels restless and warm. She hears the train whistle. She remembers her past in Gibraltar, her mother, and the various men who admired her. She recalls the beauty of the landscape, the sea, and the flowers. She thinks about her own body and its desires.

She ends her soliloquy with a final, passionate affirmation of life, desire, and her own agency. She recalls the day Bloom proposed to her on Howth Head, and their kiss, confirming her ""yes"" to life, love, and her own desires. She is full of anticipation for the morning and the next encounter.

**Conclusion:**
The provided text concludes with Molly Bloom's extensive stream of consciousness, revealing her innermost thoughts, desires, and memories. While her monologue doesn't depict external actions beyond her internal musings and physical sensations in bed, it serves as the culmination of the day's events, providing her perspective on her marriage to Leopold Bloom, her affair with Blazes Boylan, her past relationships, and her general philosophy of life. She reflects on the complexities of human relationships, sexuality, social conventions, and her own powerful, earthy nature. The final word, ""Yes,"" signifies her ultimate affirmation of life and its experiences, full of passion and acceptance. The text ends with her thoughts on the possibility of a new beginning, perhaps with Stephen Dedalus, and her readiness to embrace whatever the future holds."
