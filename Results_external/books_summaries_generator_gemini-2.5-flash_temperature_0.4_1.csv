A Doll_s House-Henrik Ibsen,"The play opens on Christmas Eve in the comfortably furnished home of Nora and Torvald Helmer. Nora, in high spirits, returns from shopping, hiding macaroons from her husband, Torvald. Torvald, a newly appointed bank manager, playfully scolds Nora for being a ""spendthrift"" and reminds her of his strict policy against debt and borrowing. Nora, however, is excited about their improved financial situation after the New Year, when Torvald's new salary begins. She reveals she has been buying Christmas presents for their three children and the maids, and hints at a secret gift for Torvald.

Their conversation is interrupted by the arrival of Mrs. Linde, an old school friend of Nora's, whom Nora hasn't seen in many years. Mrs. Linde is a widow, having lost her husband three years prior, and has no children. She explains she has had a hard life, working constantly to support her bedridden mother and two younger brothers, but now that they are self-sufficient, she feels ""unspeakably empty"" and is looking for work in town, preferably office work.

Nora, delighted by her husband's new position, promises to speak to Torvald about finding Mrs. Linde a job at the bank. She then confides a ""great secret"" to Mrs. Linde: when Torvald was gravely ill early in their marriage, doctors advised a year in Italy to save his life. To fund this, Nora secretly borrowed two hundred and fifty pounds, leading Torvald and others to believe her dying father had provided the money. She has been diligently paying off the debt through small, secret earnings from needlework and copying, and by saving half of her household allowance, often at personal sacrifice. She expresses pride in having saved Torvald's life and managing the debt.

Shortly after, a lawyer named Krogstad arrives to see Torvald on bank business. Mrs. Linde recognizes him and is visibly disturbed. Dr. Rank, a close family friend and frequent visitor, also emerges from Torvald's study, revealing Krogstad is ""morally diseased"" and is currently with Helmer. Nora offers Dr. Rank a macaroon, admitting they are forbidden by Torvald. She also jokes about wanting to say ""I'm damned!"" if Torvald could hear her.

When Torvald appears, Nora introduces Mrs. Linde and immediately begins to lobby him for a position for her friend at the bank. Torvald agrees to consider it. After Torvald, Dr. Rank, and Mrs. Linde depart, Krogstad reappears. He confronts Nora, revealing that Torvald is dismissing him from his post at the bank and giving it to Mrs. Linde. Krogstad demands Nora use her influence to ensure he keeps his job, threatening to expose her secret if she fails. He reveals he knows she forged her father's signature on the bond for the loan, pointing out that the signature is dated three days after her father's death and the date is in Nora's handwriting. Nora confesses to the forgery, explaining she did it to save Torvald's life and couldn't burden her dying father with the truth of Torvald's illness. Krogstad warns her that the law cares nothing for motives and that his own past ""indiscretion"" (which cost him his reputation) was no worse than hers. He states that if he loses his position, she will lose hers with him.

Nora is terrified. When Torvald returns, she tries to distract him from checking the letterbox, where Krogstad's letter is. She attempts to persuade Torvald to keep Krogstad, but Torvald refuses, citing Krogstad's moral failings (forgery) and, more importantly, his overly familiar manner towards him. He believes Krogstad's presence would make his position at the bank intolerable and that a deceitful person poisons a home, especially affecting children. Torvald sends off Krogstad's dismissal letter. Nora is distraught, realizing it's too late, but Torvald assures her he will protect her and take all responsibility if anything comes to light.

In Act II, Nora is visibly anxious. The Christmas tree is stripped of its decorations. She checks the letterbox, finding it empty. She discusses with the Nurse the possibility of children forgetting their mother if she leaves. Mrs. Linde arrives to help Nora mend her Tarantella dress for the upcoming fancy-dress ball. Nora reveals Dr. Rank is suffering from a terminal spinal disease, inherited from his father's excesses. Mrs. Linde, suspecting Dr. Rank lent Nora the money, advises Nora to end her relationship with him. Nora denies Dr. Rank's involvement but admits she needs to ""make an end of it"" with Krogstad. Mrs. Linde senses Nora is hiding something serious.

When Torvald comes home, Nora desperately tries to prevent him from checking the letterbox by asking him to help her practice her Tarantella dance. During the practice, Nora dances wildly, seemingly possessed by anxiety. Dr. Rank plays the piano, and Mrs. Linde observes. Helmer is concerned by Nora's intensity and agrees to coach her, promising not to open any letters or the letterbox until after the ball. After Helmer and Dr. Rank leave for dinner, Mrs. Linde reveals she went to see Krogstad but he was out of town; she left him a note. Nora, overwhelmed, calculates she has only ""thirty-one hours to live"" until the secret is revealed.

Act III begins with Mrs. Linde waiting for Krogstad. When he arrives, she reveals she asked him to meet her. She confesses she left him years ago for a wealthier man to support her family, but now that her obligations are fulfilled, she feels her life is empty. She proposes they reunite and work together, offering to be a mother to his children. Krogstad is overjoyed and accepts, seeing a chance to redeem his reputation. Mrs. Linde then tells Krogstad that his letter to Helmer is already in the letterbox. Krogstad wants to retrieve it, but Mrs. Linde insists Helmer must read it, believing that the ""unhappy secret must be disclosed"" for Nora and Helmer to achieve a ""complete understanding."" Krogstad agrees to this, stating he will wait for her downstairs.

Helmer and Nora return from the ball, with Helmer playfully chastising Nora for wanting to stay longer. He expresses his possessive affection for her. Dr. Rank then arrives, revealing he has received ""absolute certainty"" about his terminal illness and will soon ""lie rotting in the churchyard."" He tells them he will send a card with a black cross when the end is near, signifying his final farewell. He asks Helmer for a cigar, and Nora lights it for him. He then states he will be ""invisible"" at the next ball, implying his death. He leaves.

Helmer goes to empty the letterbox, noticing someone tried to pick the lock (Nora's attempt). He finds Dr. Rank's cards with black crosses and Krogstad's letter. Nora tries to stop him, but Helmer reads the letter. He is horrified, calling Nora a ""hypocrite, a liar—worse, worse—a criminal!"" He blames her father's lack of principle and fears his own reputation will be ruined, believing people will suspect him of complicity. He declares their marriage over, stating she will remain in the house only for appearances, and he will not allow her to raise the children.

Just then, the maid brings another letter for Nora. Helmer takes it and reads it. He shouts with joy, announcing he is ""saved!"" Krogstad, having found happiness with Mrs. Linde, has returned Nora's bond and expressed regret. Helmer tears up the bond and both letters, throwing them into the stove. He then ""forgives"" Nora, believing she acted out of love but lacked understanding. He promises to protect her, calling her his ""frightened little singing-bird"" and ""helpless darling,"" and states that she has become ""both wife and child to him.""

Nora, however, has changed into her everyday dress. She tells Helmer they must have a serious conversation, the first in their eight years of marriage. She states that neither her father nor Helmer ever truly loved her, but only enjoyed being ""in love"" with her. She feels she has been a ""doll-child"" to her father and a ""doll-wife"" to Helmer, living in a ""playroom."" She declares she is not fit to raise the children and must educate herself, announcing she is leaving him and their home immediately.

Helmer is shocked and forbids her, but Nora asserts he can no longer forbid her anything. She explains she needs to stand alone to understand herself and her place in the world. Helmer appeals to her ""sacred duties"" as a wife and mother, but Nora counters that she has ""other duties just as sacred"" to herself. She questions the fairness of laws that prevent a woman from saving her dying father or husband. Helmer believes she is ill or out of her mind, but Nora insists her mind has never been clearer. She tells him she no longer loves him. She explains that the ""wonderful thing"" she had hoped for—that he would sacrifice his honor for her—did not happen. Instead, he only cared about his own reputation, revealing to her that she had been living with a ""strange man"" for eight years.

Helmer offers to change, suggesting they live like ""brother and sister,"" but Nora says it's too late. She returns her wedding ring and demands his, declaring she is setting them both free from all obligations. She refuses any further contact or help from him. Nora states that for their life together to be a ""real wedlock,"" both of them would have to be ""so changed,"" but she no longer believes in ""wonderful things happening."" She leaves the house, and the sound of a door shutting is heard from below. Helmer is left alone, calling her name, then questions if ""The most wonderful thing of all—?"" might still happen."
Alice_s Adventures in Wonderland-Lewis Carroll,"Alice, bored while sitting by her sister on a riverbank, notices a White Rabbit with pink eyes, wearing a waistcoat, taking a watch from its pocket and exclaiming, ""Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!"" Driven by curiosity, Alice follows the Rabbit down a large rabbit-hole.

She falls for a long time down a deep well, passing cupboards, bookshelves, maps, and pictures. She takes an empty jar of ""ORANGE MARMALADE"" and places it in a cupboard as she continues to fall. During her descent, she contemplates her location, her cat Dinah, and eventually dozes off, dreaming of Dinah. She suddenly lands on a pile of sticks and dry leaves, unhurt.

Alice sees the White Rabbit hurrying down a long passage, lamenting his lateness. She follows him into a long, low hall lined with locked doors. On a small glass table, she finds a tiny golden key. The key is too small for the large doors, but she discovers a low curtain concealing a fifteen-inch-high door, which the golden key fits. Opening it, she sees a beautiful garden but is too large to enter.

Returning to the table, Alice finds a bottle labeled ""DRINK ME."" After ensuring it's not poison, she drinks the contents, which taste like a mixture of various foods. She immediately begins to shrink, becoming ten inches tall, the perfect size for the small door. However, she realizes she left the golden key on the table, now far out of her reach. She tries to climb the table leg but fails, then sits down and cries, creating a pool of tears.

Scolding herself, Alice soon notices a small cake under the table marked ""EAT ME."" She eats it, hoping it will change her size. Instead of shrinking, she grows enormously, becoming over nine feet tall, her head hitting the hall's roof. She grabs the key and rushes to the garden door, but is now too big to get through, only able to peer in with one eye. She sits down and cries again, adding to the pool of tears she created earlier, which now fills half the hall.

The White Rabbit returns, splendidly dressed, carrying gloves and a fan, muttering about the Duchess. Alice, desperate, asks for help, startling the Rabbit, who drops his items and flees. Alice picks up the fan and gloves. As she fans herself, she begins to shrink again, realizing the fan is the cause. She quickly drops it to avoid disappearing entirely, ending up about two feet tall. She runs back to the small door, but it's locked, and the key is still on the unreachable table.

Her foot slips, and she falls into the pool of tears, now chin-deep in salt water. She swims, regretting her excessive crying. She encounters a Mouse also swimming in the pool. Alice attempts to speak to it, first in English, then in French, which frightens the Mouse. Alice apologizes, realizing the Mouse dislikes cats. She tries to soothe it by describing her own cat, Dinah, but inadvertently mentions Dinah's mouse-catching skills, further offending the Mouse. She then mentions a dog that kills rats, causing the Mouse to swim away in disgust. Alice calls it back, promising not to mention cats or dogs. The Mouse agrees to tell its story on the shore.

The pool has become crowded with other creatures (a Duck, a Dodo, a Lory, an Eaglet), and Alice leads them all to the bank. They are all dripping wet and uncomfortable. They discuss how to get dry. The Mouse attempts to dry them by reciting a dry history lesson about William the Conqueror, but it's ineffective. The Dodo proposes a ""Caucus-race,"" which involves running in a circle, starting and stopping whenever one likes, until everyone is dry. After about half an hour, the Dodo declares everyone has won and must have prizes. Alice, designated as the prize-giver, distributes comfits from her pocket to everyone. For her own prize, she offers a thimble, which the Dodo solemnly presents back to her.

After the prizes, the Mouse begins its promised ""long and a sad tale,"" which Alice initially misunderstands as a ""long tail."" The Mouse recites a poem about a trial between Fury and a mouse, where the mouse is condemned to death. Alice's inattention and comments about the ""fifth bend"" (mishearing ""end"") offend the Mouse, who walks away. Alice, trying to win it back, mentions her cat Dinah's prowess at catching mice and birds, which causes all the birds to flee in terror. Alice is left alone and cries again.

The White Rabbit reappears, searching for his lost fan and gloves, muttering about the Duchess. He mistakes Alice for his housemaid, Mary Ann, and orders her to fetch them from his house. Alice, frightened, obeys, finding the Rabbit's house and going upstairs. She finds a fan and gloves, along with another bottle. She drinks from it, hoping to grow, and does so rapidly, filling the entire room. Her head presses against the ceiling, one arm extends out the window, and one foot up the chimney.

The Rabbit returns, calling for Mary Ann. Alice's elbow prevents him from opening the door. He tries the window, and Alice, with her hand, snatches at him, causing a shriek and broken glass. The Rabbit then calls for ""Pat"" (a Lizard named Bill), ordering him to remove Alice's arm from the window. Alice snatches again, causing more shrieks and broken glass. She hears the creatures outside planning to use ladders and send Bill the Lizard down the chimney. Alice kicks her foot down the chimney, sending Bill flying out. The Rabbit suggests burning the house down, but Alice threatens to set Dinah on them. They then throw pebbles, which turn into little cakes, into the window. Alice eats one, shrinks, and runs out of the house, escaping the crowd of animals.

In the wood, Alice plans to grow to her normal size and find the garden. She encounters an enormous puppy and, after a brief, terrifying game of fetch, escapes. She finds a large mushroom and a blue Caterpillar sitting on top, smoking a hookah. The Caterpillar asks Alice, ""Who are _you?_"" Alice explains her identity crisis due to constant size changes. The Caterpillar is unimpressed and asks her to recite ""You are old, Father William,"" which Alice does incorrectly. The Caterpillar criticizes her recitation. When Alice expresses a desire to be a ""little larger"" than three inches, the Caterpillar (who is exactly three inches tall) becomes angry. It then crawls away, telling Alice that one side of the mushroom will make her grow taller and the other shorter.

Alice breaks off a piece from each side of the mushroom. She nibbles the right-hand bit and shrinks until her chin hits her foot. She then eats from the left-hand bit, and her neck grows immensely long, like a serpent, rising above the treetops. A Pigeon attacks her, mistaking her for a serpent trying to steal its eggs. Alice tries to explain she is a little girl, but the Pigeon doesn't believe her. Alice eventually manages to eat from both pieces of mushroom, returning herself to her normal height. She then sees a small house and, to avoid frightening its inhabitants, shrinks herself to nine inches tall before approaching.

At the house, Alice observes a Fish-Footman delivering a croquet invitation from the Queen to a Frog-Footman for the Duchess. She enters the house and finds the Duchess nursing a sneezing, howling baby in a smoky kitchen, while a Cook throws dishes and fire-irons around. A Cheshire Cat sits by the fire, grinning. Alice asks about the Cat's grin, and the Duchess explains it's a ""Cheshire cat."" The Duchess then sings a violent lullaby to the baby, shaking it severely. She flings the baby at Alice, saying she must go play croquet with the Queen. Alice takes the squirming baby outside, where she realizes it is transforming into a pig. She sets it down, and it trots away into the wood.

Alice then sees the Cheshire Cat again, sitting on a tree branch. She asks it which way to go. The Cat explains that it depends on where she wants to get to, and since she doesn't care, it doesn't matter. It tells her that a Hatter and a March Hare live nearby, and both are mad. The Cat explains that everyone here is mad, including Alice, because she came. It demonstrates its own madness by growling when pleased and wagging its tail when angry. The Cat vanishes and reappears several times, finally disappearing slowly, leaving only its grin floating in the air for a while.

Alice finds the March Hare's house, where the March Hare and the Hatter are having a never-ending tea-party with a sleeping Dormouse. They tell Alice there's ""no room,"" but she sits down. They offer her wine, but there is none, leading to an argument about civility. The Hatter asks the riddle ""Why is a raven like a writing-desk?"" but neither he nor the March Hare knows the answer. The Hatter explains that he and ""Time"" had a quarrel, so it's always six o'clock (tea-time), which is why they constantly move around the table for clean cups. The Dormouse, after being pinched awake, tells a nonsensical story about three sisters living in a ""treacle-well"" and drawing ""treacle"" and things beginning with ""M."" Alice, frustrated by their rudeness and illogic, leaves the party.

She finds a door in a tree, which leads her back to the long hall. She retrieves the golden key, uses her mushroom to shrink to a foot high, and finally enters the beautiful garden. She sees three card-shaped gardeners painting white roses red to avoid the Queen's wrath, as they mistakenly planted a white rose-tree. The Queen's procession arrives, consisting of card-soldiers, courtiers, royal children, guests (including the White Rabbit), the Knave of Hearts, and finally, the King and Queen of Hearts. Alice refuses to lie down like the gardeners. The Queen asks Alice her name and who the gardeners are. Alice, feeling brave, says she doesn't know and it's ""no business of mine."" The furious Queen screams ""Off with her head!"" but Alice dismisses it as ""Nonsense!"" The King intervenes, and the Queen orders the gardeners' heads off. Alice hides the gardeners in a flower-pot.

The Queen invites Alice to play croquet. The game is chaotic: the ground is uneven, the balls are live hedgehogs, the mallets are live flamingoes, and the arches are doubled-up soldiers who constantly move. The Queen frequently shouts ""Off with his head!"" or ""Off with her head!"" Alice sees the Cheshire Cat's grin appear. She complains to the Cat about the unfair game. The King tries to have the Cat's head removed, but the executioner argues it's impossible without a body. Alice suggests asking the Duchess, who is in prison. As the executioner goes to fetch the Duchess, the Cat's head fades away.

The Duchess returns, linking arms with Alice, and begins a conversation filled with convoluted morals. The Queen reappears, angrily ordering the Duchess to leave or be beheaded. The Duchess vanishes instantly. The Queen sends Alice and the Gryphon to hear the Mock Turtle's story. The Gryphon reveals that the Queen's execution threats are never carried out. They find the Mock Turtle, who is weeping. He tells them he ""was a real Turtle"" and describes his education at a sea-school, including subjects like ""Reeling and Writhing"" and ""Uglification."" He also describes a dance called the ""Lobster Quadrille,"" which he and the Gryphon demonstrate, singing a song about a whiting and a snail. Alice tries to recite a poem but gets the words wrong, further confusing the Mock Turtle and Gryphon.

Suddenly, a cry of ""The trial's beginning!"" is heard. The Gryphon pulls Alice away, and they run to the court. The King and Queen of Hearts are on their throne, with the Knave of Hearts in chains, accused of stealing the Queen's tarts. The White Rabbit acts as herald. Alice observes the King as judge and twelve animal-jurors writing on slates. The White Rabbit reads the accusation: a poem stating the Knave stole the tarts.

The Hatter is called as the first witness, providing confusing testimony about his tea-party. Alice grows larger again, causing discomfort to the Dormouse. The King threatens the Hatter with execution for his unclear evidence. A guinea-pig cheers and is suppressed by being stuffed into a bag. The Hatter is dismissed, and the Queen orders his head off, but he escapes. The Duchess's Cook is the next witness, refusing to give evidence and only saying tarts are made of ""Pepper, mostly."" The Dormouse interjects ""Treacle,"" leading to chaos as the Queen orders its beheading and suppression. During the commotion, the Cook disappears.

Finally, the White Rabbit calls the last witness: Alice. Alice, forgetting her size, jumps up and knocks over the jury-box, spilling the jurymen. She hastily puts them back, correcting Bill the Lizard who was placed upside down. The King asks Alice what she knows about the stolen tarts, and she replies, ""Nothing."" The King declares this ""very important,"" but the White Rabbit corrects him to ""unimportant."" The King then reads ""Rule Forty-two: _All persons more than a mile high to leave the court_."" Alice, now very large, refuses to leave, arguing the rule was just invented. The King, flustered, tells the jury to consider their verdict.

The White Rabbit then produces a newly found paper, a set of verses, which he claims is a letter from the prisoner. The Knave denies writing it. The King insists not signing it proves guilt. Alice argues the verses prove nothing as they are nonsensical. The White Rabbit reads the verses, which are indeed obscure. The King attempts to interpret them, trying to link lines to the Knave and Queen. The Queen, enraged by a pun, shouts ""Sentence first—verdict afterwards!"" Alice, now at her full size, loudly declares, ""Stuff and nonsense! Who cares for you? You're nothing but a pack of cards!""

At this, the entire pack of cards flies up and descends upon Alice. She screams and tries to bat them away, only to find herself lying on the riverbank, with her head in her sister's lap. Her sister wakes her, asking about her long sleep. Alice recounts her ""curious dream"" to her sister. Her sister, after listening, kisses her and sends her off for tea. Alice runs, marveling at her wonderful dream. Her sister remains on the bank, contemplating Alice's adventures, and begins to dream herself, imagining the characters and events of Wonderland, and how they would transform back into the ordinary sounds and sights of her own world. She then pictures Alice as a grown woman, sharing these tales with future children, retaining her childhood heart and joy."
Anna Karenina-Leo Tolstoy,"The plot of the provided text, ""Anna Karenina,"" unfolds across eight parts, detailing the intertwined lives and relationships of several prominent Russian families, primarily the Oblonskys, Karenins, Shtcherbatskys, and Levin.

**Part One** begins with the Oblonsky family in disarray. Darya Alexandrovna (Dolly) has discovered her husband, Prince Stepan Arkadyevitch Oblonsky (Stiva), is having an affair with their French governess. This revelation has caused three days of turmoil, with Dolly refusing to leave her room and Stiva sleeping in his study. Stiva, a charming but self-indulgent man, feels remorse for being caught but not for the affair itself. He recalls his ""idiotic smile"" that enraged Dolly. Their household staff is affected, with some giving notice. Stiva's valet, Matvey, hints at Stiva's financial difficulties and suggests that Stiva's sister, Anna Arkadyevna, might help reconcile the couple. Dolly, however, announces her intention to leave. Stiva attempts to reconcile with Dolly, expressing regret and mentioning their children, but Dolly is furious, calling him ""loathsome"" and a ""stranger."" She threatens to expose him. A child's cry briefly softens her, but she ultimately slams the door on him. Stiva leaves for his office, while Dolly, despite her anger, is consumed by household duties and the impossibility of leaving with her five children.

At his office, Stiva, a well-connected and respected government official, is visited by his old friend, Konstantin Dmitrievitch Levin. Levin, a country gentleman, is shy and feels out of place in Moscow. He has come to propose to Kitty Shtcherbatskaya, Dolly's younger sister, with whom he has been in love since his youth. Levin had previously left Moscow, convinced he was unworthy of Kitty due to his unconventional life, but has returned determined to propose. He is annoyed by his half-brother, Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev, being mentioned. Levin expresses his disillusionment with local government, having resigned from the district council. Stiva, aware of Levin's feelings for Kitty, suggests he visit the Zoological Gardens where Kitty skates.

Levin, heart pounding, finds Kitty at the skating rink. He is overwhelmed by her presence but forces himself to speak to her. They skate together, and Levin, in a moment of emotion, tells her his stay depends on her. Kitty, remembering Vronsky, skates away. The old Prince Shtcherbatsky and Princess Shtcherbatskaya arrive. The Princess, who prefers Vronsky for Kitty, stiffly invites Levin to visit. Kitty, however, softens her mother's coldness by saying ""Good-bye till this evening."" Stiva arrives and takes Levin to dinner.

At the restaurant, Levin is uncomfortable with the city's artificiality. Stiva, guessing Levin's intentions, encourages him, saying Dolly believes Kitty will marry him. Levin is overjoyed but then stung by Stiva's revelation that Count Alexey Kirillovitch Vronsky, a wealthy and charming officer, is also in love with Kitty and is a serious rival. Stiva, seeking advice on his own infidelity, describes his mistress and asks Levin how he can reconcile his love for his wife with his passion for another. Levin, disgusted, divides women into ""women"" and ""vermin"" and dismisses Stiva's ""tragedy."" Stiva argues that life is not ""all of a piece."" Levin leaves, still determined to propose.

Kitty, at home, is excited by the prospect of Vronsky's proposal. She recalls her tender feelings for Levin but sees a brilliant future with Vronsky. When Levin arrives early, she realizes he intends to propose and is horrified at having to hurt him. She tells him she cannot marry him. The Princess enters, relieved. Countess Nordston, a friend of Kitty's, teases Levin. Vronsky arrives, and Levin, seeing Kitty's bright eyes, knows she loves Vronsky. Levin observes Vronsky's ""humble submission and dread"" when he looks at Anna. The Prince, who prefers Levin, is cold to Vronsky. Levin leaves, his last impression being Kitty's happy face as she talks to Vronsky. Kitty, though glad to have received an offer, feels remorse for Levin. The Prince and Princess argue about Vronsky, with the Prince accusing his wife of ""matchmaking"" and ruining Kitty.

Vronsky, who has led a luxurious and coarse life, is charmed by Kitty's innocence but doesn't consider marriage. He feels a strong bond with her. He goes to meet his mother at the Petersburg railway station, where he encounters Stiva. Stiva tells him Levin proposed to Kitty and was rejected. Vronsky feels like a conqueror. He then sees Anna Karenina, Stiva's sister, and is immediately captivated by her ""caressing and soft"" expression. A station guard is crushed by a train, which Anna calls an ""omen of evil."" Vronsky gives money to the widow. Anna asks about Vronsky, and Stiva reveals he hopes Vronsky will marry Kitty.

Anna stays with Dolly, who is distraught over Stiva's affair. Anna, with genuine sympathy, helps Dolly and Stiva reconcile. Anna, however, feels a growing attraction to Vronsky. At a ball, she dances with Vronsky, and their mutual attraction is evident to all, including Kitty, who is devastated. Anna intentionally avoids Vronsky's bow, but her eyes betray her feelings. Anna leaves the ball early, feeling a mix of pleasure and dread. She realizes she is falling in love with Vronsky.

Back in Petersburg, Anna continues to meet Vronsky in society. She initially resists his advances but soon realizes his pursuit is the ""whole interest of her life."" Vronsky, in turn, finds his life with Anna fulfilling, but the secrecy and deceit begin to weigh on him. Anna becomes pregnant. She confesses this to Vronsky, who is initially pale and silent, but then declares they must end the deception and live together. Anna, however, is terrified of leaving her son, Seryozha. She dreams of her husband and Vronsky both being her husbands.

Alexey Alexandrovitch Karenin, Anna's husband, notices the societal whispers about Anna and Vronsky. He is not jealous by nature but feels his position is compromised. He decides to confront Anna, demanding she cease seeing Vronsky. He accuses her of being ""base"" and ""immoral."" Anna, in a fit of anger, confesses her love for Vronsky and her hatred for him. Alexey Alexandrovitch, though deeply wounded, resolves to maintain an ""external _status quo_"" to avoid scandal, but plans to punish her by taking Seryozha and seeking a divorce. He consults a lawyer, who suggests ""adultery by mutual consent"" for an easy divorce, but Alexey Alexandrovitch's religious scruples and desire to prevent Anna from being happy with Vronsky make him reject this.

Kitty, meanwhile, is sent to a German watering-place to recover from her illness, which her father believes is due to Vronsky's slight. She befriends Varenka, a kind and selfless Russian girl who cares for an invalid, Madame Stahl. Kitty is inspired by Varenka's spiritual life and philanthropic work, contrasting it with her own past worldly pursuits. She tries to emulate Varenka, but her father, Prince Shtcherbatsky, returns and punctures her idealized view of Madame Stahl and her new friends. Kitty is also distressed when she realizes a sick artist, Petrov, has developed feelings for her, causing awkwardness with his wife. Varenka confesses a past love affair that ended due to the man's mother. Kitty, relating this to her own situation, feels shame and humiliation. She realizes her ""new life"" was a ""sham."" She returns to Russia, cured but changed, her Moscow troubles a memory.

**Part Two** focuses on Levin's attempts to find meaning in life and his eventual marriage to Kitty. After his rejection by Kitty, Levin returns to his country estate, feeling disillusioned. He tries to implement new farming methods, but faces resistance from his peasants. He is also troubled by his dying brother, Nikolay, who is consumed by illness and bitterness. Nikolay, living with Marya Nikolaevna, rages against society and his brothers. Levin, witnessing Nikolay's suffering and his own fear of death, questions the meaning of life. He finds solace in hard physical labor, mowing with his peasants, and feels a connection to their simple, laborious life. He encounters Kitty again, and their love is rekindled.

Levin proposes to Kitty a second time, and she accepts. Their engagement and wedding are a mix of joy and awkwardness, as Levin struggles with religious ceremonies he doesn't fully believe in and his own past ""sins."" He confesses his past to Kitty, who, though deeply hurt by his lack of purity, forgives him. Their early married life is marked by unexpected quarrels and adjustments, but they find happiness in their shared life in the country.

**Part Three** details Anna and Vronsky's life abroad and Alexey Alexandrovitch's reaction. After Anna's confession and Vronsky's suicide attempt, Alexey Alexandrovitch, though initially filled with rage and a desire for divorce, is moved by Anna's near-death experience and forgives her. He feels a ""spiritual peace"" and even tenderness for the baby girl, who is Vronsky's child. However, he soon realizes his position is untenable in society. Countess Lidia Ivanovna, a pious friend, takes charge of Alexey Alexandrovitch's household and encourages his new-found religious fervor, which helps him cope with his humiliation.

Anna and Vronsky, meanwhile, are living in Italy. Vronsky, initially happy, soon experiences _ennui_ and takes up painting. He commissions a portrait of Anna from a Russian artist, Mihailov, who captures Anna's beauty but also her inner turmoil. Vronsky's own attempts at painting are less successful. Anna, though happy with Vronsky, struggles with her separation from Seryozha and the social ostracism they face. They decide to return to Russia.

**Part Four** sees Anna and Vronsky in Petersburg. Vronsky's family and society reject Anna, making their position difficult. Anna, desperate to see Seryozha, attempts to visit him on his birthday. She manages to get into her former home and has a tearful reunion with her son, who still loves her despite being told she is ""wicked."" Alexey Alexandrovitch, influenced by Countess Lidia Ivanovna and a clairvoyant named Landau, refuses to grant Anna a divorce. Anna and Vronsky, frustrated by their unresolved status and the social isolation, decide to move to Moscow.

**Part Five** focuses on the Levins' married life in Moscow and the country. Kitty becomes pregnant. Levin struggles with the practicalities of married life and his ongoing philosophical doubts. He is still trying to implement his new farming system, but it proves difficult. He is also concerned about Dolly's financial difficulties and Stiva's continued irresponsibility. Vassenka Veslovsky, a charming but frivolous cousin, visits the Levins, causing Levin to become intensely jealous of his interactions with Kitty. Levin, in a fit of rage, expels Veslovsky from his house.

Levin's brother, Nikolay, becomes critically ill. Levin and Kitty travel to his deathbed. Kitty, with her practical and compassionate nature, takes charge of Nikolay's care, comforting him and ensuring he receives the last rites. Levin, witnessing his brother's suffering and death, is again confronted with the enigma of existence. He finds solace in Kitty's unwavering faith and love, and the news of her pregnancy fills him with a new sense of purpose and apprehension.

**Part Six** sees Dolly visiting Anna and Vronsky at their country estate, Vozdvizhenskoe. Dolly is initially impressed by their luxurious lifestyle and Anna's apparent happiness, but she also notices Anna's underlying sadness and the unnaturalness of her situation. Vronsky, seeking to legitimize his daughter and marry Anna, asks Dolly to persuade Anna to write to Alexey Alexandrovitch for a divorce. Anna, however, is conflicted. She fears losing Seryozha and is unwilling to humiliate herself further. She also reveals she has undergone a procedure to prevent further pregnancies, which shocks Dolly. Anna is increasingly irritable and jealous, convinced Vronsky's love is waning. She feels trapped and isolated.

**Part Seven** continues with Anna's growing despair. She and Vronsky move to Moscow, but their relationship is strained by her jealousy and his perceived coldness. Anna feels Vronsky is pulling away, seeking independence. She becomes convinced he no longer loves her and is ashamed of her. She considers suicide as a way to punish him and regain his love. After a final, bitter quarrel, Anna, in a state of extreme emotional distress, goes to the railway station. She recalls the man crushed by a train when she first met Vronsky. In a moment of terror and despair, she throws herself under an oncoming train, dying instantly.

**Part Eight** deals with the aftermath of Anna's death and Levin's spiritual journey. Sergey Ivanovitch's book has failed to make an impact, but he finds new purpose in the Slavonic question and the Servian War. He travels to the country with Katavasov, observing the volunteers. He meets Countess Vronskaya, who recounts Vronsky's despair and suicide attempt after Anna's death, and condemns Anna as a ""bad woman."" Vronsky, consumed by grief and guilt, decides to go to Servia with a squadron he funds himself, seeking a purpose in war.

Levin, meanwhile, is deeply affected by Anna's death and Vronsky's suffering. He continues his work on his estate, but his philosophical doubts about the meaning of life persist. He is tormented by the idea of death and the apparent meaninglessness of existence. He finds himself on the brink of suicide. However, through a conversation with a simple peasant, Fyodor, who says he lives ""for his soul,"" Levin experiences a profound spiritual awakening. He realizes that the meaning of life is not found through reason or intellectual pursuits, but through faith in God and living for goodness. He understands that this knowledge is innate, ""given"" to all men, and that his previous intellectual struggles were a ""deceitfulness of intellect."" He embraces this new faith, finding peace and a positive meaning in his life, despite its ordinary struggles and imperfections. He feels a renewed sense of purpose in his family life and his work on the land, now guided by this inner conviction. He concludes that his life, with its goodness, is no longer meaningless."
Crime and Punishment-Fyodor Dostoyevsky,"The story begins on a hot July evening with a young man named Raskolnikov, who is deeply in debt to his landlady and avoids meeting her. He lives in a tiny garret in S. Place and is in an irritable, isolated state, crushed by poverty. He contemplates a ""plan"" he has been considering for a month, viewing it as an ""exploit."" He is poorly dressed, and an encounter with a drunken man who calls him ""German hatter"" makes him realize his noticeable hat could jeopardize his plan.

Raskolnikov proceeds to a large house, familiar with its back staircase, to the fourth floor where an old pawnbroker, Alyona Ivanovna, lives. He notes that a German clerk is moving out, leaving the old woman alone on that floor. He rings her bell, and she, a withered woman of sixty with suspicious eyes, lets him in. He presents an old silver watch to pawn. Alyona Ivanovna reminds him his previous pledge is due and offers him only 1.15 roubles for the watch. Raskolnikov, though angry, accepts, but lingers to ask if her sister, Lizaveta, is always with her. Alyona Ivanovna dismisses his question. Raskolnikov leaves, feeling intense repulsion for his plan, calling it ""nonsense.""

He enters a tavern for the first time, feeling dizzy and thirsty. After a beer, his thoughts clear, and he dismisses his fears. There, he meets a drunk, retired government clerk named Marmeladov. Marmeladov, in a long, rambling confession, describes his extreme poverty, his wife Katerina Ivanovna (an educated officer's daughter now consumptive and prone to rages), and his children. He admits to selling his wife's belongings for drink and that his daughter, Sonia (from his first marriage), has become a prostitute (indicated by a ""yellow ticket"") to support the family. He recounts how Sonia silently gave Katerina Ivanovna 30 roubles, leading to a tearful reconciliation between them. Marmeladov confesses that he stole his recent earnings from Katerina Ivanovna and has been drunk for five days, even begging 30 copecks from Sonia that morning for more drink. He asks Raskolnikov if he pities him.

Raskolnikov accompanies Marmeladov home. They find Katerina Ivanovna in their small, disordered room, coughing and berating her children. She screams at Marmeladov for his drinking and lost clothes, then turns on Raskolnikov, accusing him of drinking with her husband. Other lodgers and the landlady, Amalia Lippevechsel, are present. As Raskolnikov leaves, he places some coppers on the window for the family. He later questions his act of charity, then reflects on the nature of man, wondering if he is a ""scoundrel"" or if ""all the rest is prejudice.""

The next day, Raskolnikov wakes up ill and irritable. His landlady threatens to report him to the police for unpaid rent. Nastasya, the servant, brings him a letter from his mother. The letter reveals that his sister, Dounia, has been working as a governess for the Svidrigaïlovs, where Mr. Svidrigaïlov made inappropriate advances. His wife, Marfa Petrovna, discovered this, publicly shamed Dounia, but later, after Svidrigaïlov provided proof of Dounia's innocence, she publicly cleared Dounia's name. Dounia is now engaged to Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin, a wealthy, forty-five-year-old counsellor. Luzhin desires a poor wife who will be indebted to him. His mother and Dounia hope this marriage will secure Raskolnikov's future, enabling him to finish university and work for Luzhin. His mother and Dounia are coming to Petersburg soon.

Raskolnikov is enraged by the letter, seeing Dounia's marriage as a sacrifice for his sake. He vows to prevent it, declaring, ""It is me or Luzhin!"" He feels his own helplessness and poverty. Marmeladov's words, ""Do you understand... what it means when you have absolutely nowhere to turn?"" echo in his mind. His ""plan"" from a month ago now feels menacing. He encounters a drunk, disheveled young girl being followed by a dandy. Raskolnikov intervenes, giving a policeman money to help her, but then, in a sudden revulsion, tells the policeman to let them be. He reflects on the girl's likely fate as a prostitute and wonders if Dounia could face a similar one.

He remembers he was going to visit his old university comrade, Razumihin, for work. He decides he will visit Razumihin ""on the next day after It, when It will be over."" Overwhelmed, he falls asleep in a park. He has a vivid nightmare of his childhood, witnessing a peasant, Mikolka, brutally beating an old mare to death. He wakes in terror, realizing the dream's connection to his plan to kill Alyona Ivanovna. He feels he cannot commit the act and experiences a sense of relief and freedom.

However, on his way home, he overhears Lizaveta Ivanovna, the pawnbroker's sister, discussing with a huckster that she will be away from home at seven o'clock the next day. This means Alyona Ivanovna will be alone. This ""chance"" encounter solidifies his resolve. He recalls a previous time he overheard a student in a tavern discussing killing Alyona Ivanovna for her money, arguing it would be justified for the good of humanity.

The next morning, Raskolnikov, still ill, finds some bloodstains on his trousers, which he cuts off. He realizes he still has the stolen items in his pockets and hides them in a hole in his wall. He is summoned to the police station for an unpaid IOU to his landlady. Relieved it's not about the murder, he argues with the assistant superintendent, Ilya Petrovitch. He faints during the conversation. While recovering, he overhears the police discussing the pawnbroker's murder, mentioning a painter, Nikolay, who confessed after being found with the old woman's ear-rings and trying to hang himself. They also discuss how the door was found locked, then unlocked, suggesting the murderer was inside and slipped away. Raskolnikov realizes they suspect him.

He rushes home, hides the stolen items under a stone in a deserted courtyard. He feels a momentary triumph. He then visits Razumihin, who is concerned about his illness and offers him translation work. Raskolnikov, in a fit of irritation, takes the money and leaves, then returns it. On a bridge, he throws 20 copecks (given to him by a woman who mistook him for a beggar) into the Neva, feeling cut off from everything. He is woken by screams, hearing his landlady being beaten by Ilya Petrovitch. Nastasya tells him it was his ""blood crying in your ears,"" not a real beating.

Razumihin, Zossimov (the doctor), and the messenger from Vahrushin visit Raskolnikov, who is still ill. He receives 35 roubles from his mother. Razumihin buys him new clothes and pays off his IOU. Razumihin tells him he raved about ""ear-rings and chains"" during his delirium. Zossimov diagnoses him with a ""fixed idea"" related to the murder. Luzhin arrives, and Raskolnikov, in a furious outburst, tells Dounia he will not allow her marriage and insults Luzhin. Luzhin leaves, enraged.

Sonia Marmeladov visits, inviting them to her father's funeral. Raskolnikov, in a strange state, asks her about her life and her family's suffering. He presses her, asking how she can live in such ""filth"" and degradation. He then confesses to her that he killed Alyona Ivanovna and Lizaveta. Sonia is horrified but embraces him, promising to follow him to Siberia to share his suffering. He gives her Lizaveta's cypress wood cross. He leaves, resolving to confess.

On his way to the police station, he publicly bows down and kisses the earth in the Hay Market, as Sonia had urged. He sees Sonia following him. At the police station, he finds Ilya Petrovitch. He learns that Svidrigaïlov has shot himself. Raskolnikov, pale and reeling, confesses to Ilya Petrovitch that he killed Alyona Ivanovna and Lizaveta with an axe and robbed them.

**EPILOGUE:**
Raskolnikov is confined to a prison in Siberia. His trial is straightforward as he confesses clearly and precisely, detailing every aspect of the crime, including the hidden items under the stone. The court is puzzled by his failure to use the stolen money and his lack of memory regarding the trinkets, concluding he committed the crime due to ""temporary mental derangement"" or ""homicidal mania."" Raskolnikov, however, states his motive was poverty and his confession was due to ""heartfelt repentance."" Due to extenuating circumstances (his past good deeds, like helping a student and rescuing children from a fire), he is sentenced to eight years of penal servitude.

During the trial, his mother, Pulcheria Alexandrovna, falls ill with a nervous disorder and partial derangement. Dounia and Razumihin move her out of Petersburg and concoct a story about Raskolnikov being away on business. His mother, however, forms her own delusion that he is in hiding from powerful enemies and will become a great statesman. She dies of brain fever within a fortnight, having revealed in her delirium that she knew more about his terrible fate.

Two months after Raskolnikov's confession, Dounia marries Razumihin. They plan to move to Siberia in five years to be with Raskolnikov. Sonia, using the money Svidrigaïlov gave her, follows Raskolnikov to Siberia. She visits him regularly in prison, at work, and in the hospital when he falls ill. The other convicts, initially hostile, grow to respect and love Sonia, calling her ""Little mother Sofya Semyonovna.""

While ill in the hospital, Raskolnikov has a dream of a plague that makes everyone mad, killing each other, and destroying the world, with only a few chosen ones surviving. This dream troubles him. After recovering, he is discharged. Sonia, who has also been ill, visits him at his work on the river bank. He is suddenly overcome with emotion, falls to her feet, and weeps, embracing her knees. Sonia understands his love, and a light of infinite happiness comes into her eyes. They both realize a new life is dawning for them, filled with love and the promise of resurrection. He takes up Sonia's New Testament, the book from which she read him the story of Lazarus. The story ends with the beginning of their new journey, a ""gradual renewal of a man."""
Death in Venice-Thomas Mann,"Gustav Aschenbach, a renowned writer in his fifties, takes a walk in Munich one spring afternoon, feeling overwrought from his demanding work. He finds himself at the North Cemetery, where he observes an unusual-looking, red-haired man with a pug nose and exposed teeth. This encounter leaves Aschenbach feeling a sudden, intense longing for travel and far-off places, a feeling he had long suppressed due to his disciplined life and dedication to his work. He experiences a vivid hallucination of a tropical swampland. Despite his usual aversion to extensive travel and his current struggle with a piece of writing, he decides he needs a break and plans a three-to-four-week trip to a pleasant resort in the South.

The narrative then delves into Aschenbach's background, detailing his successful literary career, his disciplined and solitary life, and his physical frailty. He was ennobled on his fiftieth birthday and settled in Munich after his wife's death, living a respectable life with his married daughter. His art, though celebrated, was built on immense personal effort and a constant struggle against his own weakness. He believed great art came ""in spite of something"" and his later style became more formal and dignified, moving away from youthful cynicism.

Two weeks after his Munich walk, Aschenbach departs. He travels by night train to Trieste, then by ship to Pola, and finally to an island in the Adriatic. However, he is dissatisfied with the island's weather and atmosphere, realizing his true destination is Venice. He quickly arranges to leave, boarding an old, decrepit steamer. On board, he is disturbed by the sight of an elderly man disguised as a youth with makeup, a wig, and false teeth, behaving boisterously with younger companions. Aschenbach feels a sense of ""dream-like estrangement.""

Upon arrival in Venice, the weather is grey and dreary. Aschenbach is repulsed by the drunken, grotesque behavior of the disguised old man. He takes a gondola, intending to go to the public steamboat dock for the Lido, but the insolent, unlicensed gondolier insists on taking him directly to the Lido by sea. Aschenbach, feeling helpless and strangely complacent, allows himself to be taken. When they arrive, the gondolier vanishes before Aschenbach can pay, leaving him to learn from a hotel employee that the man was unlicensed and he ""rode for nothing.""

Aschenbach checks into a beach hotel on the Lido. In the lobby, he sees a Polish family, including three girls, a governess, and a boy of about fourteen. He is immediately struck by the boy's ""absolutely beautiful,"" godlike appearance, comparing him to Greek sculpture. The boy's luxurious attire contrasts sharply with his sisters' severe clothing, suggesting he is a pampered favorite, though Aschenbach also notes his pale, ivory skin, hinting at frailty. The boy's eyes briefly meet Aschenbach's as he enters the dining hall.

The next day, the weather remains poor, and Aschenbach considers leaving, recalling a past illness in Venice. However, at breakfast, he sees the beautiful boy again, who enters with ""extraordinary charm."" Aschenbach, captivated, decides to stay. On the beach, he observes the boy, whom he deduces is named Tadzio, playing with other children. He notices Tadzio's disdain for a Russian family and is ""cheered and unstrung"" by the boy's ""childish fanaticism."" He watches Tadzio bathing, emerging from the sea like a ""frail god,"" inspiring Aschenbach with a sense of myth. He feels a ""paternal affection"" for Tadzio.

Later, in the hotel lift, Aschenbach sees Tadzio up close and notices his teeth are ""jagged and pale,"" suggesting he is ""sickly"" and ""will not grow old."" Aschenbach feels a strange ""gratification"" at this thought. That afternoon, Aschenbach visits Venice, but the city's oppressive sultriness and crowded streets make him feel ill, confirming his earlier decision to leave. He plans to go to another watering place. He returns to the hotel, announces his departure, and prepares his luggage.

The next morning, Aschenbach regrets his hasty decision, wishing for another day on the beach. He is irritated by the hotel staff rushing his departure. Just as he is about to leave, Tadzio passes him in the lobby, their eyes meeting. Aschenbach silently bids Tadzio farewell, even speaking the words to himself. On the steamboat trip across the lagoon, Aschenbach is overcome with intense regret and misery, realizing his deep attachment to Venice and the impossibility of returning due to his health. He feels his physical defeat is ""dishonourable.""

At the station, in a moment of intense conflict, Aschenbach learns his large trunk has been mistakenly sent to Como. He is seized by ""adventurous delight"" and ""unbelievable hilarity."" He declares he cannot travel without his trunk and decides to return to the Lido hotel to await its return. He quickly arranges for his ticket to be redeemed and boards the hotel's motorboat back to the Lido. He laughs at this ""comically dreamlike"" mishap, seeing it as fate bringing him back. Back in his new, almost identical room, he is content to be back, but also disapproves of his own irresolution. He sees Tadzio returning from the sea and feels ""the exhilaration of his blood, a conflict of pain and pleasure,"" realizing Tadzio was the true reason for his reluctance to leave. He makes a ""spontaneous act of welcome, of calm acceptance.""

Days turn into weeks of sunny weather. Aschenbach remains at the Lido, his luggage returned, fully unpacked. He is bewitched by the easy rhythm of life and the proximity of Venice. He sees Tadzio constantly, on the beach, in the hotel, and in the city. He wakes early to watch Tadzio, admiring his beauty, which he equates with ""the beautiful itself, form as the thought of God."" He feels a ""drunkenness"" and begins to write again, his style inspired by Tadzio's ""godlike"" form. He attempts to approach Tadzio on the beach but is overcome by emotion and retreats. He sends for more money, no longer considering going home. He dreams of Dionysian revels and classical myths, seeing Tadzio as Hyacinth, loved by two gods.

A tense, unspoken familiarity develops between Aschenbach and Tadzio, with the boy often walking unnecessarily close to Aschenbach's spot on the beach, and their glances meeting. One evening, after Tadzio's family dines in the city, Aschenbach sees Tadzio in a dark sailor suit. Their eyes meet, and Tadzio smiles at Aschenbach, a ""deep, fascinated, magnetic smile"" like Narcissus. Aschenbach is overwhelmed, flees to the dark park, and whispers, ""I love you!""

In his fourth week, Aschenbach notices fewer guests and overhears the barber mention ""the plague."" He goes to Venice and detects a ""peculiar odour"" of sickness and disinfectant. He sees municipal warnings about gastric diseases, but the euphemistic language suggests a cover-up. He questions a shop proprietor, who dismisses it as a precaution. Back at the hotel, he reads newspapers, finding official denials amidst rumors, confirming his suspicion that cholera is rampant and being concealed to protect tourism. He feels a ""dark contentment"" with this ""wicked secret,"" which aligns with his own hidden passion, terrified of Tadzio leaving.

He begins to stalk Tadzio, following him through Venice's labyrinthine streets, enduring ""deadly agony"" when he loses sight of him. He feels ""drunk"" and driven by a ""demon."" He even hires a gondola to secretly follow Tadzio's gondola. He stops outside Tadzio's hotel room, leaning his head against the door in ""utter drunkenness."" He has moments of lucidity, questioning his path and recalling his ancestors' strict principles, but ultimately embraces his ""illicit experience"" and the ""advantages of chaos."" He questions the hotel manager about disinfectants, receiving an evasive answer.

That evening, a band of street singers performs at the hotel. Aschenbach observes Tadzio nearby. The lead singer, a ""buffo baritone"" with a ""vulgar"" and ""repulsive"" performance, reminds Aschenbach of the man at the cemetery. A strong carbolic smell emanates from the singer. Aschenbach, his ""passion lam[ing] the sense of discrimination,"" asks the singer about the disinfection, who denies any plague. Hotel employees question the singer for speaking out. Aschenbach notices Tadzio's ""portentous childish obedience"" in mirroring his seriousness, and also Tadzio's quick breathing, suggesting lung congestion. He thinks, ""He is sickly, he will probably not grow old,"" with ""rakish gratification.""

The next day, Aschenbach goes to an English travel bureau and, after pressing the clerk, learns the full truth: Indian cholera has spread to Venice, with high fatalities, and the authorities are covering it up to protect trade. A quarantine is imminent. Aschenbach feels ""feverishly excited, triumphant in his possession of the truth,"" but also ""weird horror."" He considers warning Tadzio's mother but realizes he doesn't truly want to, choosing instead to keep silent, intoxicated by his complicity in the city's secret.

That night, Aschenbach has a vivid, terrifying dream of a Dionysian orgy, a ""raging mob"" of people and beasts, with ""wickedly persistent flutes"" and the smell of ""wounds and prevalent disease."" He is drawn into the ""blinding deafening lewdness,"" his soul tasting ""unchastity and fury of decay."" He awakens ""unnerved, shattered, and hopelessly under the power of the demon."" He no longer cares about being noticed. Guests are fleeing, but Tadzio's family remains. Aschenbach feels that flight and death might leave him alone with the boy, and ""laws of morality had dropped away.""

He tries to rejuvenate his appearance, visiting the barber to have his grey hair dyed black, curled, and his skin touched up with cosmetics. The barber declares, ""Now the gentleman can fall in love unhesitatingly."" Aschenbach leaves, feeling ""happy as in a dream."" A storm wind rises, and the air is filled with the smell of ""things rotting."" He pursues Tadzio through the diseased city, using ""disgraceful subterfuges,"" and Tadzio occasionally looks back, acknowledging his admirer without betraying him. Aschenbach eventually loses Tadzio, exhausted and unnerved. He buys and eats overly ripe strawberries.

Sitting on the steps of a cistern, Aschenbach reflects on his past dignity as an artist and his current state of moral dissolution, concluding that the path of beauty for poets is a ""perilous road"" leading to ""intoxication and to desire,"" to the ""precipice."" He declares that poets ""cannot force ourselves, since we can merely let ourselves out.""

A few days later, Aschenbach feels unwell, experiencing vertigo and hopelessness. He learns the Polish family is leaving after lunch. He goes to the beach, which now looks autumnal and abandoned. Tadzio and his few remaining companions are playing unsupervised. Tadzio is forced into a wrestling match by another boy, Jaschu, who then kneels on Tadzio's back, pressing his face into the sand, nearly strangling him. Aschenbach is about to intervene when Jaschu releases Tadzio.

Tadzio, pale and rumpled, sits up, then slowly walks to the water's edge, drawing figures in the sand. He wades into the shallow sea and walks along a sand-bank, isolated. He stops, turns, and looks over his shoulder towards the shore, towards Aschenbach. Aschenbach, watching, feels as though Tadzio's ""pale and lovely lure"" is smiling and nodding to him, guiding him ""towards egregious promises."" As often before, Aschenbach stands up to follow him.

Minutes later, Aschenbach collapses in his chair. On the same day, the world receives news of his death."
Don Quixote-Miguel de Cervantes,"The story begins in a village in La Mancha, introducing a gentleman of nearly fifty who lives with a housekeeper, a niece, and a lad. He spends most of his income on food and clothing, and his leisure time is consumed by reading books of chivalry. His obsession with these tales leads him to neglect his property, selling land to acquire more books. Eventually, from lack of sleep and excessive reading, he loses his wits and comes to believe that all the events described in these books are true.

Driven by this delusion, he decides to become a knight-errant himself, intending to roam the world in full armor, seeking adventures, righting wrongs, and achieving eternal renown. He imagines himself becoming an emperor. His first step is to clean his great-grandfather's rusty armor. Finding it lacks a closed helmet, he improvises a half-helmet from pasteboard. After a test slash with his sword destroys it, he reinforces it with iron bars and deems it perfect. He then spends four days naming his lean hack, settling on ""Rocinante."" Next, he names himself ""Don Quixote,"" and adds ""of La Mancha"" to his name, following the tradition of famous knights. Finally, he realizes he needs a lady to be in love with. He chooses Aldonza Lorenzo, a farm-girl from a nearby village whom he once admired, and renames her ""Dulcinea del Toboso.""

One hot July morning, Don Quixote, fully armored, sallies forth on Rocinante. He is immediately struck by the realization that he has not been dubbed a knight, a crucial requirement of chivalry. He resolves to be knighted by the first person he encounters. He rides along, imagining a chronicler recording his deeds and addressing his lady. Towards nightfall, tired and hungry, he arrives at an inn, which he perceives as a magnificent castle. He sees two young women, whom he mistakes for fair maidens or ladies, and a swineherd's horn blast sounds to him like a dwarf announcing his arrival. He courteously addresses the frightened women, assuring them he is a knight. The innkeeper, a fat man, emerges, amused by Don Quixote's appearance but also somewhat intimidated. Don Quixote, mistaking the innkeeper for the ""Alcaide of the fortress,"" requests lodging. He is given ill-cooked stockfish and black bread, which he struggles to eat due to his helmet, requiring one of the women to feed him. He drinks wine through a reed. The sowgelder's pipe further confirms his delusion that he is being regaled with music in a famous castle. Despite this, he remains distressed about not being formally knighted.

To remedy this, Don Quixote kneels before the innkeeper in the stable, demanding to be dubbed a knight. The innkeeper, recognizing his guest's madness, decides to humor him. He claims there is no chapel but suggests Don Quixote watch his arms in the courtyard. He also advises Don Quixote to carry money and clean shirts, as true knights-errant do. Don Quixote agrees and places his armor on a trough by a well, beginning his vigil. A carrier attempts to water his mules, needing to move the armor. Don Quixote warns him, but the carrier flings the armor away. Don Quixote invokes Dulcinea and strikes the carrier with his lance, knocking him senseless. He replaces his armor. Another carrier attempts the same, and Don Quixote strikes him, splitting his head. A brawl ensues, with the carriers stoning Don Quixote. The innkeeper intervenes, explaining Don Quixote is mad. The stoning stops. The innkeeper, eager to end the trouble, performs a mock knighting ceremony, using his account-book as a prayer book and striking Don Quixote with his sword. The two damsels gird his sword and buckle his spur. Don Quixote, now ""knighted,"" thanks the host and rides off on Rocinante, leaving without paying.

Don Quixote, elated, decides to return home to gather money, shirts, and a squire. He plans to recruit a farm-laborer named Sancho Panza. On his way, he hears cries and finds a youth, Andres, being flogged by a farmer. Don Quixote intervenes, ordering the farmer to pay Andres his wages. The farmer, terrified, agrees. Don Quixote, satisfied, rides off. However, as soon Quixote is out of sight, the farmer flogs Andres again, mocking Don Quixote. Andres vows to find Don Quixote. Unaware of this, Don Quixote congratulates himself. He then encounters a party of Toledo traders, whom he mistakes for knights. He demands they confess Dulcinea's unparalleled beauty. One trader mockingly asks for a portrait. Enraged, Don Quixote charges, but Rocinante stumbles, throwing him. A muleteer beats Don Quixote with a piece of his broken lance. Don Quixote, though battered, believes this is a typical knightly mishap. A peasant from his village finds him, recognizes him, and helps him onto his ass. Don Quixote, still deluded, recounts chivalric tales, mistaking the peasant for a marquis. They arrive at Don Quixote's house, where his housekeeper, niece, the curate, and the barber are discussing his madness. The curate resolves to burn his books. Don Quixote is put to bed, claiming his bruises are from fighting giants.

The next day, while Don Quixote is asleep, the curate, barber, and housekeeper enter his library. They burn most of his books of chivalry, sparing only a few they deem less harmful or well-written. They then wall up the library, planning to tell Don Quixote a magician carried the books away. Don Quixote, upon waking, discovers his library gone and is told by his niece and housekeeper that the sage Friston, his enemy, enchanted and carried away his books. Don Quixote accepts this, believing Friston is trying to thwart his glorious destiny. He then persuades Sancho Panza to become his squire, promising him the governorship of an island. Sancho, leaving his family, agrees. Don Quixote procures money and a buckler. Sancho brings his ass, Dapple, which Don Quixote reluctantly allows. They set out at night.

As they travel, Sancho eagerly anticipates his island. They soon encounter thirty or forty windmills, which Don Quixote declares are monstrous giants. Sancho tries to convince him they are windmills, but Don Quixote, convinced by his delusion, charges. His lance breaks, and he and Rocinante are thrown to the ground. Sancho helps him, scolding him. Don Quixote attributes the transformation to Friston. He laments his broken lance and resolves to make a new one from an oak branch. He, though injured, refuses to complain, citing knightly custom, but allows Sancho to complain. Sancho eats and drinks from his provisions. They spend the night in the woods.

The next day, they head towards Puerto Lapice. Don Quixote warns Sancho not to intervene if he fights knights. They encounter two Benedictine friars and a coach with a lady. Don Quixote believes the friars are magicians abducting a princess. He charges the first friar, who falls from his mule. Sancho attempts to strip the friar, claiming spoils, but the muleteers beat Sancho senseless. Don Quixote then addresses the lady, claiming to have rescued her and demanding she go to El Toboso to present herself to Dulcinea. A Biscayan squire from the coach, angered, challenges Don Quixote. They fight, and the Biscayan wounds Don Quixote, damaging his helmet and ear. Don Quixote strikes back, knocking the Biscayan from his mule. The ladies intervene, and Don Quixote agrees to spare the Biscayan on condition he present himself to Dulcinea.

Sancho, recovered, asks for his promised island. Don Quixote explains this was not an island adventure. Don Quixote, seeing his shattered helmet, vows an oath of vengeance to not eat from a tablecloth or embrace his wife until he takes another helmet. Sancho objects to the oath and the lack of practical rewards. Don Quixote dismisses his concerns. They spend the night with goatherds. Don Quixote delivers a long discourse on the Golden Age. A goatherd, Antonio, sings a ballad of unrequited love. Another goatherd tells them of Chrysostom, a student-shepherd who died of love for the beautiful but scornful Marcela. They decide to attend Chrysostom's burial.

At the burial, Marcela appears and eloquently defends her right to remain chaste and free, stating she is not to blame for Chrysostom's death. Don Quixote, moved, defends her and warns anyone against following her. Chrysostom's writings are burned, and his body is buried. Don Quixote resolves to seek Marcela.

Don Quixote and Sancho search for Marcela without success. They rest, and Rocinante attempts to mate with some ponies, leading to him being beaten by Yanguesan carriers. Don Quixote and Sancho intervene but are severely beaten themselves. Sancho asks for the balsam of Fierabras. Don Quixote blames himself for fighting non-knights and promises to make the balsam. Sancho, in pain, suggests returning home. Don Quixote, now missing several teeth, insists on continuing. They find a valise containing money and letters, which Don Quixote believes belong to a desperate lover. Sancho takes the money. They see a ragged man (Cardenio) and suspect he is the owner.

That night, they encounter a funeral procession of encamisados (men in white) and mourners. Don Quixote, mistaking it for an abduction, attacks them, wounding a licentiate. Sancho loots a sumpter mule. Don Quixote, now calling himself ""Knight of the Rueful Countenance,"" learns the procession is carrying a dead body. The licentiate warns him of excommunication. Sancho, fearing the Holy Brotherhood, urges retreat. They find a secluded valley and eat the stolen provisions.

They hear a mysterious noise of water and chains. Don Quixote believes it's a perilous adventure and declares his intention to go alone, telling Sancho to wait three days and then inform Dulcinea of his death. Sancho, terrified, ties Rocinante's legs to prevent his master from leaving. Don Quixote, believing it's enchantment, agrees to wait for dawn. Sancho tells a long, rambling story about goats. At daybreak, they discover the noise comes from fulling hammers. Don Quixote is mortified, and Sancho laughs, earning him a beating from his master. Don Quixote then explains enchanters make things appear different.

They encounter a barber wearing a brass basin on his head. Don Quixote, mistaking it for Mambrino's helmet, charges and unhorses him, claiming the basin. Sancho laughs, but Don Quixote insists it's the enchanted helmet. Sancho swaps Dapple's trappings for the barber's. Sancho suggests they serve an emperor to gain fame and rewards. Don Quixote agrees, envisioning a grand career culminating in kingship and rewarding Sancho. He describes Dulcinea's beauty and noble lineage, though Sancho knows her as a farm-girl. Don Quixote, angered by Sancho's blasphemy against Dulcinea, beats him. Sancho, still pragmatic, suggests marrying the princess first. They then encounter Gines de Pasamonte, who stole Dapple, and Sancho reclaims his ass.

They return to the inn. The curate and barber, having heard of Don Quixote's madness, disguise themselves as a distressed damsel and squire to lure him home. Sancho is instructed to tell Don Quixote that Dulcinea, being illiterate, sent a verbal command for him to return. Don Quixote, still believing the inn is a castle, is greeted by Dorothea (the disguised barber), who kneels and begs him to avenge a giant who usurped her kingdom (Micomicon). Don Quixote agrees. Sancho is thrilled, imagining himself as king of Micomicon. Don Quixote, however, declares his unwavering devotion to Dulcinea, leading to another beating for Sancho. The curate and Cardenio, also disguised, join them. The barber's false beard falls off, but the curate quickly reattaches it with a ""charm.""

Dorothea, continuing her feigned story, explains her father, King Tinacrio, foretold Don Quixote would defeat the giant Pandafilando and marry her. Sancho is overjoyed, but Don Quixote again refuses marriage due to Dulcinea. Sancho, angered, is beaten again. Sancho then recounts his ""visit"" to Dulcinea, claiming she was sifting wheat and smelled ""goaty,"" but Don Quixote insists it was enchantment. Andres, the flogged boy, reappears, blaming Don Quixote for his worse beating. Don Quixote vows to avenge him later.

The duke and duchess, having read the first part of Don Quixote's history, decide to play along. They arrange a hunting party. During a boar hunt, Sancho, terrified, falls from a tree and hangs upside down. He is rescued. That night, a series of ""enchantments"" are staged: lights, military sounds, and a demon courier announcing that the sage Montesinos is bringing Dulcinea, enchanted, to give instructions for her disenchantment. Three carts appear with ""sages"" (Lirgandeo, Alquife, Archelaus). Finally, a triumphal car with a nymph (Altisidora, disguised as Dulcinea) and Merlin appears. Merlin declares Dulcinea's disenchantment requires Sancho to receive 3,300 lashes on his bare buttocks. Sancho vehemently refuses. Altisidora, unveiling her beautiful face, tearfully pleads with Sancho. Sancho, after much protest and the duke's pressure, agrees to the lashes, on his own terms.

The duke and duchess, delighted, continue their jokes. Sancho tells the duchess he gave himself five lashes with his hand. He gives her a letter for his wife, Teresa Panza, informing her of his governorship and the whipping. Trifaldin of the White Beard (the majordomo in disguise) arrives with twelve bearded duennas, recounting their tale of being cursed with beards by the giant Malambruno. Don Quixote vows to help. Clavileño the Swift, a wooden flying horse, arrives. Sancho, after much reluctance, agrees to mount it with Don Quixote. They are blindfolded. The duke and duchess's servants use bellows, tow, and squibs to simulate a fiery, high-speed flight. Sancho peeks and claims to see the earth as a mustard seed and men as hazelnuts, and to have played with goats in heaven. Clavileño explodes, throwing them to the ground. A placard announces the duennas are shaved and Clavijo and Antonomasia are restored, and Dulcinea's disenchantment awaits Sancho's whipping.

Sancho is appointed governor of the ""island"" of Barataria. He presides over several cases, displaying surprising wisdom. In one, he discovers money hidden in a cane. In another, he resolves a dispute between a woman and a pig dealer, and a tailor and a laborer. Don Quixote, meanwhile, is recovering from cat scratches. Altisidora, feigning love, serenades him. A staged ""bell and cat fright"" occurs, with cats attacking Don Quixote, leaving him with a scratched face and nose. Altisidora bandages him, blaming his insensibility.

Sancho, still governor, receives a letter from Don Quixote with advice on governing. Sancho dictates a reply, complaining about the doctor who starves him and the constant threats. That night, a staged attack on the island occurs. Sancho is ""armed"" with two shields, front and back, and bound, then trampled by the ""enemy."" He prays for the island to be lost. The ""attackers"" declare victory. Sancho, bruised and disillusioned, resigns his governorship, embracing Dapple and declaring he was not born to govern. He returns to Don Quixote.

The duke and duchess arrange a combat between Don Quixote and Tosilos (the lacquey disguised as a knight) for Doña Rodriguez's daughter. Tosilos, however, falls in love with the daughter and yields, offering to marry her. Don Quixote accepts his victory. The lacquey's identity is revealed, causing an uproar. Don Quixote attributes it to enchanters. The marriage is postponed.

Don Quixote decides to leave the castle. Altisidora sings a farewell lament, accusing him of theft and cursing him. Don Quixote denies the theft. He and Sancho depart for Barcelona. On the way, they encounter Roque Guinart, a famous highwayman. Roque and his men rob Sancho, but Roque later returns the items and distributes loot fairly. A young woman, Claudia Jeronima, tells Roque she shot her fiancé, Don Vicente, for betraying her. Roque and Claudia find Don Vicente dying. Claudia, distraught, faints, and Don Vicente dies. Claudia resolves to become a nun.

In Barcelona, Don Quixote is welcomed by Don Antonio Moreno. A placard is secretly placed on Don Quixote's back, identifying him. A Castilian insults him. Don Antonio shows Don Quixote an ""enchanted head"" that answers questions (a trick). Don Quixote asks about Montesinos's cave and Dulcinea's disenchantment; the head gives vague answers. Sancho asks about future governments and his family; the head gives equally vague answers. Don Quixote visits a printing office and discovers a false ""Second Part of Don Quixote."" He is indignant about the errors.

Don Quixote and Sancho visit the galleys. Sancho is subjected to a ""flight"" ceremony, being passed along the rowers. A corsair brigantine is captured. A young woman, Ana Felix, reveals she is a Christian Morisco, returning from Algiers with Don Gaspar Gregorio (her lover, disguised as a woman) and buried treasure. Her father, Ricote, a pilgrim, is also present. They are reunited. A plan is made to rescue Don Gaspar.

Don Quixote, still on the beach, is challenged by the Knight of the White Moon. The knight demands Don Quixote confess his lady is fairer than Dulcinea or fight. If Don Quixote loses, he must return home for a year. Don Quixote accepts. In the combat, Don Quixote is unhorsed. He confesses Dulcinea is the fairest and he the most unfortunate, and agrees to return home for a year. The Knight of the White Moon reveals himself to be the bachelor Samson Carrasco, who devised this plan to cure Don Quixote's madness. Don Gregorio is rescued.

Don Quixote and Sancho begin their journey home. Sancho complains about not being paid for his lashes. Don Quixote offers to pay him. Sancho calculates the amount and agrees to finish the whipping that night. He whips trees, groaning, until Don Quixote stops him, believing he has given over a thousand lashes. Don Quixote proposes they become shepherds for the year, he as Quixotize, Sancho as Panzino. Sancho is enthusiastic. They are trampled by a drove of pigs. Don Quixote attributes it to enchantment. They are then captured by armed men and taken back to the duke's castle.

Another ""enchantment"" is staged. Altisidora is placed on a catafalque, seemingly dead. Merlin appears and declares Altisidora will be revived if Sancho receives smacks, pinches, and pin thrusts. Sancho, after much protest, submits. Altisidora revives. Don Quixote again urges Sancho to complete his lashes for Dulcinea. Altisidora, feigning anger, dismisses Don Quixote.

Don Quixote and Sancho finally reach their village. Don Quixote interprets some boys' words and a hare chase as bad omens. Sancho, however, dismisses them. They meet the curate and bachelor. Don Quixote tells them of his defeat and his plan to become a shepherd for a year. His friends, hoping to cure him, agree to join him.

Don Quixote falls ill with a fever. After six days, he wakes up, his reason restored. He denounces books of chivalry as absurdities and deceptions, regretting his madness. He declares himself Alonso Quixano the Good and wishes to die in his right mind. His friends are astonished. Sancho weeps, begging him not to die and to continue their pastoral life. Don Quixote makes his will, forgiving Sancho, leaving his property to his niece (with a condition that she not marry anyone who knows about chivalry books), and asking forgiveness from the author of the false ""Second Part."" Don Quixote dies peacefully in his bed, like a Christian. The notary records his natural death to prevent further false histories. Cide Hamete concludes the story, stating Don Quixote was born for him, and he for Don Quixote, and that his purpose was to expose the folly of chivalry books."
Dracula-Bram Stoker,"Jonathan Harker, a young English solicitor, travels to Bistritz, Transylvania, in May to finalize a London property purchase for a nobleman named Count Dracula. Along his journey, he observes the local customs and superstitions, noting the fear of ""evil eye"" and ""were-wolves or vampires"" among the peasants. His landlord and landlady in Bistritz are visibly frightened when he mentions Count Dracula and his castle, with the landlady giving him a crucifix and imploring him not to travel on the eve of St. George's Day, when evil spirits are said to have full sway.

Harker continues his journey by diligence through the Borgo Pass. At the designated meeting point, the diligence driver attempts to send Harker to Bukovina, but a calèche driven by a tall, strong man with piercing red eyes and sharp white teeth arrives to collect him. This driver, who Harker later realizes is the Count himself, exhibits prodigious strength and an unsettling control over a pack of howling wolves. During the eerie night ride, Harker witnesses the driver repeatedly stop to investigate flickering blue flames, which the Count later explains mark hidden treasure. Harker also experiences a strange optical illusion where the driver's body does not obstruct the blue flame.

Upon arrival at the vast, ruined Castle Dracula, Harker is welcomed by the Count, a gaunt old man with a long white moustache, aquiline nose, and unusually sharp teeth. The Count's handshake is cold and incredibly strong. Harker dines alone, observing the Count's peculiar habits, such as not eating or drinking in his presence. He notices the Count has no reflection in a mirror and recoils violently from a crucifix. The Count expresses a keen interest in London, its customs, and a specific estate, Carfax, which Harker has secured for him. He also reveals his desire to perfect his English accent to blend in.

Harker soon discovers he is a prisoner in the castle, with all doors locked and no servants present, confirming his suspicion that the Count performs all tasks himself. He realizes the Count was the coachman and can control wolves. Harker attempts to send letters home via a band of Szgany (gypsies) encamped in the courtyard, including a secret shorthand letter to his fiancée, Mina. The Count intercepts the letters, burning Mina's shorthand letter as ""vile"" but sending the formal one to Harker's employer, Mr. Hawkins. The Count then confiscates Harker's travel documents and clothing.

Harker witnesses the Count crawling face-down like a lizard down the castle wall. He later sees the Count leave the castle wearing his (Harker's) stolen clothes, realizing the Count intends to impersonate him to create a false trail and deflect suspicion. Harker is tormented by the appearance of three beautiful, ghostly women in his room, who attempt to kiss him, but are violently repelled by the Count, who claims Harker as his own. The Count then throws a moving bag (implied to contain a child) to the women, who disappear with it, followed by a woman's agonized cry and the howling of wolves in the courtyard. Harker deduces the woman's child was taken and she was killed.

Driven by desperation, Harker attempts to escape by scaling the castle wall and entering the Count's room. He finds the room empty except for a heap of ancient gold. He discovers a secret passage leading to a ruined chapel beneath the castle, where he finds fifty wooden boxes filled with earth. In one of these boxes, he discovers the Count, appearing younger, gorged with blood, with a gash on his forehead (from Harker's earlier attempt to strike him) and a mocking smile. Paralyzed by the Count's gaze, Harker flees. The next morning, he finds himself trapped as the main door is locked and the passage to the chapel is sealed. He hears the Szgany taking the boxes away and realizes he is left alone with the ""awful women."" He resolves to attempt another escape, taking some gold, and praying for Mina.

Meanwhile, in England, Mina Murray and Lucy Westenra exchange letters. Lucy reveals she has received three marriage proposals from Dr. John Seward, Quincey P. Morris, and Arthur Holmwood, accepting Arthur. Dr. Seward's diary entries detail the strange case of his patient, Renfield, a ""zoöphagous maniac"" who consumes living things (flies, spiders, birds) to absorb their lives, and whose behavior seems linked to the moon. Renfield escapes the asylum several times, always heading towards the deserted Carfax estate next door, where he is found worshipping a ""Master.""

Mina receives a brief, unsettling letter from Jonathan, followed by news of Lucy's sleepwalking returning. Lucy's health deteriorates, marked by increasing pallor and two small, unhealing puncture marks on her throat. Mrs. Westenra, Lucy's mother, confides she has a fatal heart condition.
A storm hits Whitby, and a derelict Russian schooner, the _Demeter_, arrives, unsteered, with its dead captain lashed to the helm, holding a crucifix. An immense dog leaps from the ship and vanishes. The ship's cargo consists of fifty boxes of earth consigned to Carfax. The ship's log details the mysterious disappearance of the crew one by one, and the mate's encounter with a ""tall, thin, ghastly pale"" man whose knife passed through him. The mate, convinced ""It"" was in the hold, jumped overboard. The captain, fearing ""Him,"" tied himself to the wheel with a crucifix and died.
Old Mr. Swales, a local fisherman, is found dead with a broken neck, a look of terror on his face. Mina finds Lucy sleepwalking on a cliff, with a dark figure bending over her. She covers Lucy with a shawl, accidentally pricking her throat.

Lucy's condition worsens dramatically. Dr. Seward, concerned, calls in his old mentor, Professor Van Helsing, a specialist in obscure diseases. Van Helsing immediately recognizes the gravity of Lucy's condition and performs multiple blood transfusions, with Arthur, Seward, and Quincey Morris all donating their blood. Van Helsing notices the two small wounds on Lucy's throat. Mrs. Westenra, unaware of the true danger, removes the garlic placed by Van Helsing, allowing a gaunt grey wolf (the Count in wolf form) to break Lucy's window. Lucy's mother dies of shock, and Lucy herself is attacked again. Lucy dies, but her body becomes radiantly beautiful. Van Helsing, suspecting she is ""Un-Dead,"" proposes decapitation and staking, but delays for Arthur's sake.

Newspaper reports detail children being found in Hampstead with small puncture wounds on their throats, lured by a ""bloofer lady."" Van Helsing deduces that Lucy, now Un-Dead, is the ""bloofer lady."" He takes Seward to Lucy's tomb, where they find the coffin empty. That night, they witness Un-Dead Lucy carrying a child, attempting to lure Arthur. Van Helsing repels her with a crucifix, and she retreats into the tomb. The next night, Arthur, with great emotional struggle, drives a stake through Lucy's heart. She writhes and screams, then her body transforms back to its pure, sweet self. Van Helsing and Seward decapitate her and fill her mouth with garlic, ensuring her soul is at peace.

Mina Harker arrives in London, distraught by the news of Lucy's death. Jonathan, still recovering from his ordeal, recognizes the Count in London, looking younger. Mina, with her exceptional organizational skills, transcribes all the journals and letters, creating a comprehensive record of events. Van Helsing, impressed by her intellect, initially tries to keep her out of the dangerous work but eventually accepts her help, recognizing her unique abilities.

The group (Van Helsing, Seward, Jonathan, Arthur, Quincey, and Mina) convenes. Van Helsing explains the vampire's powers and limitations: immense strength, shapeshifting (wolf, bat, mist), control over certain animals and elements, but also weaknesses like being repelled by sacred objects (crucifix, Sacred Wafer, wild rose), inability to cross running water at will, and loss of power during daylight. He identifies the Count as Voivode Dracula, a historical figure. They learn the Count has bought three houses in London (Carfax, Piccadilly, Mile End, Bermondsey) and has been moving his earth-filled boxes, which serve as his resting places.

They begin their offensive. At Carfax, they sterilize the remaining twenty-nine earth boxes with Sacred Wafer, making them unusable for the Count. They then proceed to the Piccadilly house, where they find eight more boxes and sterilize them. During this, the Count appears, but Harker wounds him with a Kukri knife, causing him to drop money and flee through a window, shouting threats of revenge and claiming Mina as his. The Count escapes to a stable, which he bolts. Van Helsing burns the Count's remaining papers.

Back at Seward's house, Mina reveals she was attacked by the Count, who forced her to drink his blood from a wound on his chest, declaring her ""flesh of my flesh; blood of my blood; kin of my kin."" This ""baptism of blood"" leaves a red scar on her forehead, which burns when Van Helsing touches it with a Sacred Wafer. Mina, now linked to the Count, fears she will become a vampire and asks her friends to kill her if that happens. They all solemnly promise.

Mina's new connection to the Count allows Van Helsing to hypnotize her at sunrise and sunset, enabling her to perceive the Count's movements. She reveals he has taken his last earth-box aboard a ship, the _Czarina Catherine_, bound for Galatz, Romania, via the Danube. The group deduces the Count's ""child-brain"" logic: he fled to his castle, expecting to evade them.

The group splits up. Lord Godalming and Jonathan Harker pursue the Count by steam launch up the Danube. Dr. Seward and Quincey Morris follow on horseback along the riverbanks. Van Helsing takes Mina by carriage to the Borgo Pass, intending to intercept the Count at his castle. Mina's hypnotic trances become more difficult to induce, and her reports become less clear, but she guides Van Helsing towards the castle.

At the castle, Van Helsing finds the three vampire women in their tombs. He performs the ritual of staking and decapitation, and their bodies crumble to dust. He places Sacred Wafer in Dracula's tomb, banishing him from it forever.

Mina and Van Helsing, now on foot, continue towards the Borgo Pass. Mina's hypnotic powers fail, but her inner guidance leads them. They spot the Szgany with the Count's last earth-box on a leiter-wagon, hurrying towards the castle. Jonathan, Godalming, Seward, and Morris converge from different directions.

They confront the gypsies. Jonathan and Quincey fight their way to the cart. Quincey is mortally wounded by a gypsy's knife. Jonathan, with a desperate effort, throws the box from the cart. As the sun sets, the Count, lying within the box, looks at the sinking sun with triumph. Jonathan's knife shears through the Count's throat, and Quincey's bowie knife plunges into his heart. The Count's body crumbles to dust.

Quincey Morris dies, finding peace in the knowledge that Mina is saved, as the scar on her forehead disappears. The gypsies flee, and the wolves follow them. The Castle of Dracula stands against the red sky as the group reflects on their victory and loss."
Frankenstein-Mary Shelley,"The narrative begins with a series of letters from Robert Walton, an English explorer, to his sister, Mrs. Saville, in England. Walton is on an expedition to the North Pole, driven by an ardent desire for discovery and glory. He writes from St. Petersburgh and later Archangel, expressing his enthusiasm for the voyage and his longing for a true friend to share his intellectual pursuits and triumphs. He details his preparations, including hiring a vessel and a courageous crew, and describes the harsh but inspiring Arctic environment.

In his fourth letter, Walton recounts a strange incident. His ship becomes surrounded by ice and thick fog. When the mist clears, they see a gigantic figure in a sledge, drawn by dogs, speeding across the ice towards the north. Two hours later, the ice breaks, freeing the ship. The next morning, they discover another sledge, adrift on a large fragment of ice, with only one dog alive and a human being inside. This man, a European, is emaciated and near death. He refuses to board Walton's ship until he learns they are bound for the northern pole, a destination that seems to satisfy him.

Walton takes the stranger, who is gravely ill, into his cabin and nurses him. The stranger is generally melancholy but shows moments of profound benevolence. When asked why he was so far out on the ice, he replies he was ""to seek one who fled from me."" The lieutenant reveals they had seen a similar sledge with a gigantic man the day before. This news revitalizes the stranger, who calls the other figure a ""dæmon"" and expresses a desperate eagerness to pursue him. Walton, captivated by the stranger's intellect and sorrow, grows fond of him. The stranger, recognizing Walton's ambition for knowledge, decides to tell his ""strange and harrowing"" story as a warning, hoping to prevent Walton from suffering a similar fate.

The stranger, Victor Frankenstein, begins his narrative. He is a Genevese by birth, from a distinguished family. His father, Alphonse, married Caroline Beaufort, a woman he rescued from poverty after her father, his friend, died. Victor, their eldest child, was born in Naples. His parents later adopted Elizabeth Lavenza, a beautiful orphan, whom Victor came to regard as his own, destined to be his wife. Victor also had a close childhood friend, Henry Clerval, a boy of singular talent and imagination.

Victor's early passion was for natural philosophy, particularly the outdated works of alchemists like Cornelius Agrippa, Paracelsus, and Albertus Magnus. His father dismissed these studies as ""sad trash."" However, a violent thunderstorm at age fifteen, which shattered an oak tree with a stream of fire, piqued his interest in electricity and galvanism, leading him to abandon his old studies for mathematics.

At seventeen, Victor's parents decide he should attend the University of Ingolstadt. Before his departure, Elizabeth contracts scarlet fever. His mother, while nursing Elizabeth, also falls ill and dies, her last wish being for Victor and Elizabeth to marry. Victor is deeply grieved.

At Ingolstadt, Victor is initially repulsed by Professor Krempe, a natural philosophy lecturer, but is inspired by Professor Waldman, a chemistry lecturer, who speaks of modern science's power to ""unfold to the world the deepest mysteries of creation."" Victor dedicates himself to science, particularly chemistry and physiology, with intense ardour. After two years, he makes significant discoveries in chemical instruments. His attention then turns to the ""principle of life."" Through intense study of anatomy and the decay of the human body, he discovers the ""cause of generation and life"" and the ability to bestow animation upon lifeless matter.

Driven by ambition, Victor decides to create a human being. To overcome the difficulty of working with minute parts, he resolves to make the creature of gigantic stature, about eight feet tall. For months, he toils in secret, neglecting his health and friends, collecting materials from dissecting rooms and charnel-houses.

On a ""dreary night of November,"" Victor brings his creation to life. The creature's ""dull yellow eye"" opens, and it breathes. However, Victor is immediately filled with ""breathless horror and disgust"" at the creature's appearance, which he describes as hideous despite his efforts to make it beautiful. He rushes out of the room, tormented by nightmares. Later, he sees the creature in his bedroom, its hand outstretched, and flees the house, wandering the streets in agitation.

The next morning, Victor is overjoyed to encounter Henry Clerval, who has arrived in Ingolstadt to study. Clerval observes Victor's emaciated and wild appearance. Victor, fearing Clerval will see the monster, rushes to his apartment, only to find it empty. He is relieved, but his joy is short-lived as he collapses into a nervous fever that confines him for several months. Clerval nurses him devotedly, concealing the extent of his illness from Victor's family.

During his recovery, Victor receives a letter from Elizabeth, who expresses concern about his long silence. She shares family news: his younger brother Ernest is growing up, and Justine Moritz, a beloved servant girl adopted by the family, has returned home after her own mother's death. Elizabeth also mentions their youngest brother, William. Victor, still haunted by his creation, finds solace in Clerval's company and studies oriental languages to distract himself from science.

As Victor and Clerval tour the environs of Ingolstadt, Victor receives a letter from his father, Alphonse, bearing tragic news: William has been murdered. The letter also mentions that a valuable miniature of Victor's mother, which Elizabeth had given to William, is missing. Victor immediately sets off for Geneva.

Upon arriving near Geneva, Victor finds the city gates closed for the night. He decides to visit the spot where William was murdered. During a violent thunderstorm, he sees the gigantic figure of his creature. He instantly realizes that the creature is William's murderer. Victor is filled with anguish but decides to remain silent, knowing his story would be dismissed as madness.

The next morning, Victor learns that Justine Moritz has been accused of William's murder. The missing miniature of his mother was found in her pocket. Despite the circumstantial evidence, Victor is convinced of Justine's innocence and the monster's guilt. Elizabeth also fiercely believes in Justine's innocence.

At the trial, Justine maintains her innocence, explaining she was searching for William all night and was forced to stay in a barn. She cannot explain how the miniature came to be in her pocket. Elizabeth speaks passionately in her defense, but the court is swayed by the evidence and public indignation. Justine is condemned. Later, Justine confesses falsely under pressure from her confessor, hoping for absolution. She is executed.

Victor is consumed by remorse and despair, believing himself to be the true murderer, responsible for the deaths of William and Justine. He contemplates suicide but is restrained by thoughts of his remaining family, Elizabeth and his father, and the fear of leaving them exposed to the monster. He vows revenge against his creation. His father and Elizabeth are deeply affected by the tragedies, with Elizabeth becoming disillusioned with human goodness.

Seeking solace, Victor travels to the Alpine valleys. On Montanvert, he encounters the creature. Victor confronts him with furious detestation, calling him ""devil"" and ""vile insect."" The creature, however, calmly demands Victor listen to his story, arguing that he is malicious because he is miserable and hated by all, including his creator. He threatens further destruction upon Victor's remaining friends if Victor refuses to comply with his conditions. Victor, swayed by a dawning sense of duty and curiosity, agrees to listen. They retreat to a hut, and the creature begins his tale.

The creature describes his awakening and initial confused sensations. He gradually learns to distinguish his senses and experiences the world. He finds fire, learns its properties, and how to cook. He learns that humans flee from him in terror. He finds refuge in a hovel attached to a cottage, where he secretly observes the De Lacey family: an old blind man, Agatha, and Felix. He learns of their gentle manners, their poverty, and their sadness. He secretly helps them by gathering wood.

By observing the De Laceys, he learns language and literacy. He reads books like ""Volney's Ruins of Empires,"" ""Plutarch's Lives,"" and ""Paradise Lost."" Through these, he learns about human society, history, virtues, and vices. He realizes his own monstrous appearance and outcast status, comparing himself to Adam, but more fittingly, to Satan, excluded from all bliss. He finds Victor's journal, which reveals the horrific details of his creation and Victor's disgust, confirming his identity as a ""filthy type"" of man.

He learns the history of the De Laceys: they were a respected French family ruined when Felix helped Safie's father, a Turkish merchant, escape unjust imprisonment. Felix fell in love with Safie, a Christian Arab, and promised to marry her. The Turk betrayed Felix, leading to the De Laceys' imprisonment, loss of fortune, and exile to Germany. Safie, refusing to return to Turkey, escaped her father and found her way to Felix.

Inspired by the De Laceys' virtues, the creature hopes to win their affection. He plans to introduce himself to the blind De Lacey first, believing his voice, though harsh, is not terrible, and the old man's blindness will prevent immediate horror. When Safie, Agatha, and Felix are away, he enters the cottage and speaks to De Lacey, who treats him with kindness. As he is about to reveal his identity, Felix, Safie, and Agatha return. Their horror and Felix's violent attack confirm his fears. The creature flees, enraged.

He declares ""everlasting war against the species"" and against Victor. He returns to the cottage to find the De Laceys have abandoned it. In a fit of rage, he burns the cottage to the ground. He resolves to find Victor, guided by the journal, and travels towards Geneva, enduring immense suffering and hatred from humans. During his journey, he saves a young girl from drowning but is shot by her male companion, further solidifying his hatred.

Near Geneva, he encounters William, Victor's youngest brother. He attempts to befriend the child, but William screams, calls him a monster, and reveals his name is Frankenstein. Enraged, the creature strangles William. He then takes a miniature of Caroline Beaufort from William's neck and places it in the pocket of a sleeping Justine Moritz, framing her for the murder.

The creature concludes his story by demanding Victor create a female companion for him, promising that they will then leave Europe forever and live harmlessly in the wilds of South America. He argues that his malice stems from his solitude and that a companion of his own kind would bring him happiness and virtue.

Victor is moved but also horrified by the creature's proposition. He initially refuses, fearing the creation of a race of devils. The creature threatens to make Victor ""so wretched that the light of day will be hateful"" to him and vows, ""I will be with you on your wedding-night."" Victor, swayed by the creature's arguments, his sense of duty, and the threats, reluctantly agrees to create a female, on the condition that they both leave Europe forever.

Victor returns to Geneva, but cannot bring himself to start the work. His father notices his continued melancholy and suggests he marry Elizabeth immediately. Victor, still bound by his promise to the creature, postpones the marriage, claiming he needs to travel to England for scientific knowledge, intending to complete the second creature there in solitude. Henry Clerval accompanies him on his journey through England and Scotland.

In a remote Orkney island, Victor begins his work on the female creature. However, he is plagued by doubts and fears: the female might be more malicious, they might hate each other, or they might breed a race of monsters. He sees the creature watching him through the window. In a moment of moral conviction and rage, Victor destroys the half-finished female creature. The creature, witnessing this, howls in ""devilish despair and revenge"" and reiterates his threat: ""I shall be with you on your wedding-night.""

Victor disposes of the remains of the female creature in the sea. He falls asleep in his boat and drifts far from the Orkneys, eventually landing in Ireland. There, he is immediately accused of murder. He is brought before Magistrate Kirwin and taken to view the body, which he discovers to be Henry Clerval, strangled. Victor collapses in convulsions and falls into a long nervous fever, during which he raves, confessing to the murders of William, Justine, and Clerval.

He eventually recovers in prison. His father arrives to console him. Victor is acquitted when it is proven he was on the Orkney Islands at the time of Clerval's murder. He returns to Geneva with his father, still tormented by guilt and the monster's threat, which he now interprets as a threat to his own life on his wedding night.

Elizabeth writes to Victor, expressing her fears and asking if he loves another. Victor reassures her of his love and promises to reveal a dreadful secret the day after their marriage. He agrees to an immediate marriage, believing he is sealing his own death, but hoping it will bring peace to Elizabeth and his father.

Victor and Elizabeth marry and travel to Villa Lavenza on Lake Como for their honeymoon. Victor carries pistols and a dagger, expecting the monster to attack him. On their wedding night, Victor sends Elizabeth to her room, intending to confront the monster alone. He hears Elizabeth's scream, rushes in, and finds her strangled by the monster. The monster appears at the window, jeering, and then leaps into the lake, escaping.

Victor returns to Geneva. His father, upon hearing of Elizabeth's death, dies of grief in Victor's arms. Victor, now having lost everyone he loved, is confined to a cell, believed to be mad. Upon regaining his sanity, he resolves to dedicate his life to destroying the monster. He attempts to convince a criminal judge to pursue the monster, but the judge is incredulous about the monster's existence and powers. Victor, enraged, leaves, determined to pursue the monster himself.

Victor embarks on a relentless pursuit of the creature across vast portions of the earth, guided by the monster's occasional taunting messages and footprints in the snow. The chase leads them to the Arctic regions. Victor procures a sledge and dogs and gains on the monster. However, a ground sea breaks up the ice, separating them. Victor, adrift and near death, is rescued by Walton's ship.

Victor concludes his story, urging Walton to continue his quest for vengeance if he dies, warning him not to be swayed by the monster's eloquence.

Walton continues the narrative in his letters. He describes Frankenstein's declining health and passionate state. Walton's crew, fearing death in the ice, demands to turn south. Frankenstein, despite his weakness, delivers an impassioned speech, urging them to continue the expedition for glory. Walton is moved but ultimately agrees to turn south if the ship is freed. The ice breaks, and the ship turns south.

Frankenstein dies on September 12th. Walton hears a sound from Frankenstein's cabin and finds the monster lamenting over Frankenstein's body. The monster expresses profound remorse and grief, explaining that his turn to evil was a consequence of his misery and the universal rejection he faced. He admits his crimes, including the murders of William, Justine, Clerval, and Elizabeth, but argues that his own suffering was immense and that he was a slave to his impulse for vengeance. He states that his self-loathing is greater than anyone else's abhorrence. He declares his work of vengeance is complete and that he will now travel to the northernmost pole to build his own funeral pyre and burn himself to ashes, ensuring that his remains cannot be used to create another like him. He bids farewell to Walton and leaps from the cabin window onto an ice raft, disappearing into the darkness and distance. Walton is left to return to England, his own ambitions thwarted, reflecting on the tragic events."
Great Expectations-Charles Dickens,"Pip, an orphan boy, lives with his harsh, older sister, Mrs. Joe Gargery, and her kind husband, Joe, the blacksmith, in a marsh country. One day in the churchyard, a fearsome escaped convict threatens Pip, demanding a file and food (""wittles"") be brought to him at an old Battery the next morning, warning of a more terrible ""young man"" who is with him. Pip, terrified, complies. He secretly steals food and a file from his home.

On the misty marshes, Pip first encounters another convict, the ""young man,"" who curses at him and flees. Pip then finds his original convict, who is starving. Pip gives him the stolen provisions and the file. The convict, enraged by the presence of the other man (Compeyson), pursues him. Pip returns home, burdened by guilt.

At Christmas dinner, Mrs. Joe's guests, including Uncle Pumblechook and Mr. Wopsle, lecture Pip on gratitude. Pip has replaced the brandy with tar-water, causing Uncle Pumblechook to have a violent reaction. When the stolen pork pie is about to be served, Pip, overwhelmed, runs out and encounters soldiers who have come to ask Joe to mend handcuffs for escaped convicts. The sergeant reveals they are pursuing two convicts on the marshes. Pip's convict, now named Provis, is found fighting Compeyson. Provis claims he captured Compeyson. He confesses to stealing food from the blacksmith's, and Joe, despite his wife's anger, tells him he is welcome to it. Provis is then taken back to a prison-ship. Pip, unable to confess his secret to Joe, feels immense guilt.

Pip attends a chaotic evening school run by Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt, where Biddy, an orphan, is the effective teacher. Joe reveals his own abusive childhood and explains he married Mrs. Joe partly to provide a home for Pip. Mrs. Joe announces that Miss Havisham, a wealthy recluse, wants Pip to visit. Pumblechook takes credit for this arrangement.

At Miss Havisham's decaying mansion, Satis House, Pip meets Estella, a beautiful but scornful young lady. Miss Havisham, dressed in a faded wedding gown, with clocks stopped at twenty minutes to nine, tells Pip her heart is ""Broken!"" She orders him to ""play"" and tells Estella to ""Beggar him."" Estella treats Pip with disdain, making him feel common. Pip later fights a ""pale young gentleman"" in the garden, whom he defeats. Estella allows Pip to kiss her cheek, but he feels it is a gesture of contempt. Pip returns home, ashamed of his commonness. He lies about his visit to Mrs. Joe and Pumblechook but confesses the truth to Joe, who, with simple wisdom, advises him against lying.

Pip's annual visits to Miss Havisham continue, where he receives a guinea each time. Miss Havisham, still living in the past, encourages Estella to ""Break their hearts."" Pip, increasingly discontent with his life as a blacksmith's apprentice, confides in Biddy his desire to become a gentleman for Estella's sake. Biddy questions his motives and warns him that Joe is too proud to change his station. Pip, however, accuses Biddy of envy. Orlick, Joe's jealous journeyman, causes trouble, leading to a fight with Joe, who easily defeats him. Mrs. Joe is attacked and left brain-damaged, only able to communicate by drawing a hammer on a slate, which Biddy interprets as ""Orlick."" Mrs. Joe, surprisingly, shows propitiation towards Orlick.

Four years into his apprenticeship, Pip, now twenty-one, is informed by Mr. Jaggers, a London lawyer, that he has ""great expectations"" from an anonymous benefactor and must be educated as a gentleman. Joe, selflessly, refuses any compensation for losing Pip. Pip, believing Miss Havisham is his benefactor, leaves for London, feeling a mix of excitement and guilt over abandoning Joe and Biddy.

In London, Pip lives with Herbert Pocket, the ""pale young gentleman"" from Miss Havisham's, who becomes his close friend. Herbert reveals Miss Havisham's tragic past: she was jilted on her wedding day by a man named Compeyson, who conspired with her half-brother, Arthur, to swindle her. This trauma led her to stop time in her house. Herbert also reveals Estella is adopted and was raised by Miss Havisham to exact revenge on men. Pip, now called ""Handel"" by Herbert, confesses his love for Estella.

Pip begins his studies with Herbert's father, Mr. Matthew Pocket, a kind but distracted tutor. Pip, with Wemmick's help, secretly arranges for Herbert to get a partnership with a merchant, Clarriker, using his own money. Pip continues to visit Miss Havisham and Estella. Estella, now a beautiful woman, treats Pip with cold disdain, telling him she has ""no heart."" Pip is tormented by his love. He learns that Bentley Drummle, a coarse fellow, is pursuing Estella, and she encourages him. Estella reveals she is going to marry Drummle. Pip is heartbroken.

Pip receives a mysterious note from Wemmick: ""DON'T GO HOME."" Wemmick reveals that Compeyson is alive, in London, and that Pip's chambers are being watched. He advises Pip to get Provis out of England. Pip receives another anonymous letter, instructing him to come alone to the sluice-house on the marshes for information about ""your uncle Provis."" Pip, despite his fears, goes.

At the sluice-house, Pip is ambushed, caught in a noose, and tied up by Orlick. Orlick confesses to attacking Mrs. Joe and reveals he was the lurker Pip stumbled over when Provis arrived. He intends to kill Pip and dispose of his body. Orlick also reveals he knows of Provis's presence in England and warns Pip of others, including Compeyson, who seek Magwitch. Pip's desperate cries for help are answered by Herbert and Startop, who, having found Pip's note, followed him with the help of Trabb's boy. Orlick escapes.

Pip, injured by the fire at Miss Havisham's, is nursed by Herbert. Herbert reveals that Provis (Magwitch) is Estella's father, and her mother is Molly, Mr. Jaggers's housekeeper, whom Jaggers defended in a murder trial years ago. Jaggers, through a hypothetical discussion, implicitly confirms this, explaining he saved Estella from a life of crime by giving her to Miss Havisham. He warns Pip that revealing the truth would harm all involved.

Pip, Herbert, and Startop proceed with their plan to get Magwitch out of England. They row him down the Thames to meet a foreign steamer. However, a four-oared galley intercepts them. The man in charge apprehends ""Abel Magwitch, otherwise Provis,"" a ""returned Transport."" Magwitch, in a desperate move, pulls the cloak from a shrinking figure in the galley, revealing Compeyson. Compeyson, terrified, falls overboard with Magwitch. Magwitch is rescued but severely injured. Compeyson's body is later found. Magwitch's possessions are forfeited to the Crown.

Magwitch is taken to prison, gravely ill. Pip, his former repugnance gone, now feels deep affection and gratitude for Magwitch. He visits him daily. Magwitch is found guilty and sentenced to death. On his deathbed, Pip tells Magwitch that his daughter, Estella, is alive, beautiful, and loved. Magwitch smiles, places Pip's hand on his chest, and dies peacefully.

Pip, now in debt and without expectations, falls gravely ill. Joe comes to London and nurses him back to health, paying off his debts. Pip, humbled and repentant, realizes his ingratitude. He decides to return to his village to confess his errors to Biddy and propose marriage. However, upon his arrival, he discovers Biddy has married Joe. Pip expresses his profound gratitude and love to them both, acknowledging his past faults, and tells them he is going abroad to work and repay Joe.

Pip sells his remaining possessions, pays his creditors, and joins Herbert in the East, becoming a clerk and later a partner in Clarriker and Co. Years later, Herbert learns of Pip's secret generosity.

Eleven years pass. Pip returns to his old village and finds Joe and Biddy with a child named Pip. He then revisits the ruined Satis House and finds Estella there. She is ""greatly changed,"" her beauty softened by suffering. She tells him she led an unhappy life, separated from her cruel husband, Drummle, who died two years prior. She has come to take leave of the garden, her only remaining possession, before it is built upon. Estella tells Pip that suffering has taught her to understand his heart, and she has given the remembrance of what she ""threw away"" a place in her heart. They agree to be friends. As they leave the ruined place, Pip sees ""no shadow of another parting from her."""
Hamlet-William Shakespeare,"The play opens at night on a platform before Elsinore Castle, where guards Francisco and Bernardo are on duty. Francisco, feeling ""sick at heart,"" is relieved by Bernardo. Horatio and Marcellus join Bernardo, having been called to witness a mysterious apparition. Horatio is initially skeptical, but the Ghost of the recently deceased King Hamlet appears, resembling the King in his battle armor. Horatio attempts to speak to it, but it stalks away. The Ghost reappears, and Horatio again tries to make it speak, asking if it has a message, a good deed to be done, knowledge of Denmark's fate, or hidden treasure. The Ghost remains silent and vanishes at the crowing of a cock, which Horatio explains causes spirits to flee. Convinced of the supernatural event, Horatio suggests they inform Prince Hamlet, believing the Ghost will speak to its son.

In a room of state, the new King, Claudius (brother to the deceased King Hamlet), addresses his court. He acknowledges his brother's death but announces his marriage to Queen Gertrude (King Hamlet's widow and Prince Hamlet's mother), stating it was done with ""wisest sorrow"" and the court's approval. He grants Laertes, son of the King's chief counselor Polonius, leave to return to France after attending the coronation. The King then turns to Prince Hamlet, who remains in deep mourning. Hamlet expresses his disgust with his uncle's hasty marriage to his mother, calling it ""incestuous"" and lamenting the swiftness with which his mother moved from his noble father to his inferior uncle. He is prevented from returning to his studies in Wittenberg by his mother's plea and the King's command, to which he reluctantly agrees. Horatio, Bernardo, and Marcellus then inform Hamlet of the Ghost's appearance. Hamlet is deeply troubled, suspects ""foul play,"" and resolves to join them on watch that night, making them swear to secrecy.

At Polonius's house, Laertes warns his sister Ophelia against Hamlet's affections, calling them a fleeting ""toy in blood"" and reminding her that Hamlet, as a prince, cannot choose his wife freely, as the state's welfare depends on it. He advises her to guard her honor. Ophelia promises to heed his advice. Polonius enters and, before Laertes departs for France, gives him a series of moral precepts, emphasizing self-reliance, careful friendship, and honesty. After Laertes leaves, Polonius questions Ophelia about Hamlet's ""tenders Of his affection."" Ophelia confirms Hamlet's honorable advances, but Polonius dismisses them as ""springes to catch woodcocks"" and forbids her from having any further contact with Hamlet, which Ophelia promises to obey.

Back on the platform, Hamlet, Horatio, and Marcellus await the Ghost. Trumpets and cannons sound from the castle, signaling the King's revelry, which Hamlet criticizes as a custom ""More honour'd in the breach than the observance."" The Ghost appears, and Hamlet directly addresses it as his father, demanding to know why it has left its grave. The Ghost beckons Hamlet to follow it alone. Despite Horatio and Marcellus's warnings that it might lead him to madness or harm, Hamlet, valuing his life at nothing, breaks free and follows.

In a more remote part of the platform, the Ghost reveals to Hamlet that he is indeed his father's spirit, doomed to suffer in purgatorial fires until his ""foul crimes"" are purged. He commands Hamlet to ""Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder."" The Ghost explains that the official story of his death by a serpent's sting is a lie; the ""serpent that did sting thy father's life Now wears his crown""—his own brother, Claudius. The Ghost details how Claudius, with ""witchcraft of his wit"" and ""traitorous gifts,"" seduced Queen Gertrude. He then describes how Claudius poured ""juice of cursed hebenon"" into his ear while he slept in his orchard, instantly killing him and robbing him ""Of life, of crown, of queen."" He died ""Unhousel'd, disappointed, unanel'd"" (without last rites). The Ghost urges Hamlet to seek revenge but warns him not to ""taint thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive Against thy mother aught: leave her to Heaven."" The Ghost vanishes as dawn approaches. Hamlet, alone, vows to remember only his father's command. Horatio and Marcellus arrive, and Hamlet, acting erratically, makes them swear on his sword (and with the Ghost's voice from beneath confirming) never to reveal what they have seen, nor to betray his intentions should he ""put an antick disposition on"" (act mad). Hamlet concludes that ""The time is out of joint;--O cursèd spite, That ever I was born to set it right!""

Later, Ophelia reports to Polonius that Hamlet visited her in a disheveled and piteous state, staring at her, sighing, and backing out of the room with his eyes fixed on her. Polonius concludes that Hamlet is ""Mad for thy love,"" believing his madness stems from Ophelia's obedience to his command to reject Hamlet's advances. He resolves to inform the King.

The King and Queen welcome Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, Hamlet's childhood friends, to court, asking them to discover the cause of Hamlet's ""transformation."" Polonius then enters, announcing he has found the cause of Hamlet's ""lunacy."" After a verbose explanation, he presents Hamlet's love letter to Ophelia as proof. He recounts how he forbade Ophelia from seeing Hamlet, leading to Hamlet's supposed madness. Polonius proposes that he and the King hide and observe an arranged meeting between Hamlet and Ophelia in the lobby. The King agrees. Hamlet enters, reading, and Polonius attempts to engage him. Hamlet responds with cryptic, seemingly mad, but pointed remarks, calling Polonius a ""fishmonger"" and warning him to keep his daughter ""out o'the sun"" lest she ""conceive."" He then reads from his book about the failings of old men, which Polonius, aside, notes has ""method in it."" Rosencrantz and Guildenstern join Hamlet, who quickly discerns they were sent for by the King and Queen. Hamlet expresses his deep melancholy, describing the world as a ""steril promontory"" and man as a ""quintessence of dust."" He learns that a company of players is arriving. He welcomes them, and Polonius, after a long-winded introduction, confirms their arrival. Hamlet asks the First Player to recite a passionate speech about Priam and Hecuba, which moves the player to tears. Hamlet then, alone, berates himself for his inaction compared to the player's feigned emotion. He devises a plan to have the players perform ""The murder of Gonzago,"" a play resembling his father's murder, before the King, to observe his reaction and ""catch the conscience of the king.""

The King and Queen question Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, who report Hamlet's distraction but his enthusiasm for the players and the play tonight. The King and Polonius proceed with their plan to observe Hamlet and Ophelia. Hamlet enters, delivering his ""To be, or not to be"" soliloquy, contemplating suicide but deterred by the unknown terrors of the afterlife. Ophelia approaches to return Hamlet's gifts. Hamlet denies ever giving them, then launches into a harsh, misogynistic tirade, telling her to ""Get thee to a nunnery,"" accusing women of deceit and artificiality, and declaring there will be ""no more marriages."" He exits, leaving Ophelia heartbroken and convinced of his madness. The King, having observed, believes Hamlet's melancholy is not caused by love but by ""something in his soul."" He decides to send Hamlet to England immediately, ostensibly for tribute, hoping the change of scenery will cure him. Polonius, still convinced of love as the cause, suggests one last attempt: the Queen should confront Hamlet in her closet after the play, while Polonius hides to listen.

Hamlet instructs the players on the art of acting, emphasizing naturalness and holding ""the mirror up to nature."" He confides in Horatio, praising his stoicism and asking him to observe the King's reaction during the play, specifically during the scene depicting a murder similar to his father's. The court assembles for the play. Hamlet, acting erratically, lies at Ophelia's feet and makes suggestive comments. The play, titled ""The Mouse-trap"" by Hamlet, begins with a dumb show, then a prologue, and then the Player King and Queen. The Player Queen vehemently vows never to remarry if her husband dies. Hamlet's mother remarks, ""The lady doth protest too much, methinks."" The Player King then falls asleep, and Lucianus, his nephew, enters and pours poison into his ear. At this point, the King rises abruptly, cries ""Give me some light: away!"", and rushes out, followed by the court. Hamlet and Horatio are left alone, convinced of the King's guilt.

Rosencrantz and Guildenstern return, reporting the King's ""distemper"" and the Queen's desire to speak with Hamlet in her closet. Hamlet, seeing through their attempts to manipulate him, uses a recorder to illustrate how they try to ""play upon"" him, but he will not be controlled. Polonius enters, again summoning Hamlet to his mother. Hamlet, alone, resolves to be ""cruel, not unnatural"" with his mother, speaking ""daggers to her, but use none.""

In the Queen's chamber, Polonius hides behind an arras. Hamlet confronts his mother, accusing her of offending his father. When the Queen cries for help, and Polonius echoes her from behind the arras, Hamlet, believing it to be the King, cries ""A rat!"" and stabs through the tapestry, killing Polonius. Hamlet then reveals the body, calling Polonius a ""wretched, rash, intruding fool."" He continues to berate his mother, showing her pictures of his noble father and his ""mildew'd ear"" uncle, condemning her for her ""incestuous"" marriage. The Ghost reappears, visible only to Hamlet, reminding him to ""whet thy almost blunted purpose"" and to comfort his mother. The Queen, seeing Hamlet speak to empty air, believes he is mad. Hamlet, however, insists he is not mad and urges her to confess her sins to heaven, repent, and avoid his uncle's bed. He exits, dragging Polonius's body with him.

The King learns of Polonius's death from the Queen and realizes it could have been him. He resolves to send Hamlet to England immediately, fearing the public's reaction to Hamlet's popularity. He dispatches Rosencrantz and Guildenstern to find Hamlet and Polonius's body. Hamlet, when questioned by the King, speaks cryptically about Polonius being ""at supper"" where he is ""eaten"" by ""politick worms."" He tells the King to seek Polonius in Heaven or ""i'the other place yourself."" The King then orders Hamlet to England for his ""especial safety."" Hamlet agrees, bidding farewell to his ""mother"" (equating King and Queen as one flesh). The King, alone, reveals his secret plan: letters have been sent to England, ""conjuring"" (imploring) the English King to execute Hamlet upon his arrival.

Ophelia enters, distraught and singing madly, distributing symbolic flowers (rosemary for remembrance, pansies for thoughts, fennel for flattery, columbines for thanklessness, rue for sorrow, daisies for warning, and violets for faithfulness) to the King and Queen. She sings mournful songs about her dead father and a maid who lost her virginity. Laertes, having returned in a rage with a mob demanding justice for his father's death, is heartbroken to see Ophelia's madness. The King calms Laertes, promising to help him find justice for Polonius's death. A messenger arrives with letters from Hamlet, announcing his sudden and ""naked"" return to Denmark. The King and Laertes conspire: the King will arrange a fencing match between Hamlet and Laertes, where Laertes will use an ""unbated"" (unblunted) and poisoned rapier. As a backup, the King will prepare a poisoned drink for Hamlet. The Queen then enters with the tragic news that Ophelia has drowned while making garlands by a brook.

In a churchyard, two gravediggers discuss whether Ophelia, as a suicide, deserves a Christian burial, engaging in humorous, convoluted legal arguments. Hamlet and Horatio arrive and observe the gravedigger singing cheerfully while digging. Hamlet reflects on the skulls unearthed, recognizing one as Yorick, the King's jester, whom Hamlet knew in his youth. He contemplates mortality, imagining Alexander the Great's dust stopping a ""bung-hole."" A funeral procession arrives with ""maimèd rites,"" indicating a suicide. Hamlet and Horatio hide. Laertes, the King, Queen, and mourners follow Ophelia's corpse. The Priest confirms the curtailed ceremony due to the doubtful nature of her death. Laertes, distraught, leaps into the grave, expressing his immense grief. Hamlet reveals himself, declaring his love for Ophelia was greater than ""forty thousand brothers"" could make up. He grapples with Laertes in the grave, challenging his grief. The King and Queen separate them, with the Queen attributing Hamlet's outburst to madness. The King reminds Laertes of their plan.

Later, in the castle hall, Hamlet recounts to Horatio how he discovered the King's letters ordering his execution in England. He replaced them with letters ordering the execution of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, who were accompanying him. Osric, a foppish courtier, enters to invite Hamlet to the fencing match with Laertes, relaying the King's wager. Hamlet, despite a premonition, accepts, saying ""we defy augury: there is a special providence in the fall of a sparrow.""

The court assembles for the fencing match. Hamlet apologizes to Laertes for his past behavior, attributing it to his madness. Laertes accepts the apology, but states his honor still requires them to proceed. They choose foils. The King places a poisoned pearl in a cup of wine, intending it for Hamlet. During the match, Hamlet scores the first two hits. The Queen drinks from the poisoned cup, toasting Hamlet's success, despite the King's warning. Laertes then wounds Hamlet with the poisoned rapier. In the ensuing scuffle, they exchange rapiers, and Hamlet wounds Laertes with the poisoned blade. The Queen collapses, declaring she is poisoned. Laertes, dying, reveals the King's treachery: the rapier is poisoned, and the Queen is dead from the poisoned drink, and ""the king, the king's to blame."" Enraged, Hamlet stabs the King with the poisoned rapier, forcing him to drink the rest of the poisoned wine. The King dies. Laertes, exchanging forgiveness with Hamlet, also dies. Hamlet, knowing he too is dying from the poison, prevents Horatio from drinking the remaining poison. He begs Horatio to live and ""tell my story"" to clear his ""wounded name."" Hamlet dies, proclaiming, ""The rest is silence."" The play ends with a dead march."
Jane Eyre-Charlotte Brontë,"The story begins with the narrator, Jane Eyre, a young orphan living at Gateshead Hall with her aunt, Mrs. Reed, and her three cousins, Eliza, John, and Georgiana. On a cold, rainy winter day, Mrs. Reed excludes Jane from the family group in the drawing-room, citing Jane's need for a more sociable disposition. Jane retreats to the breakfast-room, where she finds a book of pictures and hides in a window-seat. Her cousin, John Reed, discovers her, bullies her, and eventually strikes her with the book, causing her head to bleed. In a rare outburst, Jane verbally retaliates, calling John a ""murderer"" and Mrs. Reed cruel. Mrs. Reed, enraged, orders Jane to be confined in the ""red-room,"" a grand, seldom-used chamber where her late husband, Mr. Reed, died.

Locked in the red-room, Jane is overwhelmed by fear and a sense of injustice. She recalls that Mr. Reed, her uncle, had made Mrs. Reed promise to raise her as her own child. Jane's terror intensifies when she imagines Mr. Reed's ghost and sees a mysterious light in the room, causing her to scream and lose consciousness. She wakes up in her own bed, attended by the apothecary, Mr. Lloyd, and Bessie, the nurse. Jane overhears Bessie and the housemaid, Sarah, discussing the incident, hinting at strange occurrences and Mrs. Reed's harshness. Mr. Lloyd questions Jane about her unhappiness, and she reveals her lack of family and the mistreatment she endures at Gateshead. She expresses a desire to leave and go to school. Mr. Lloyd recommends to Mrs. Reed that Jane be sent away for a change of air. Jane later overhears Bessie and the lady's-maid, Abbot, discussing her parents' death from typhus fever, her mother's disinheritance by her grandfather Reed for marrying a poor clergyman, and Mrs. Reed's eagerness to be rid of Jane.

Weeks later, Jane remains isolated at Gateshead. John Reed attempts to bully her again, but Jane fights back, striking him. When Mrs. Reed scolds John, Jane defiantly declares that the Reed children are ""not fit to associate with me."" Mrs. Reed punishes her severely. During this time, Jane finds solace in her doll and occasionally experiences kindness from Bessie. One morning, a carriage arrives, bringing Mr. Brocklehurst, the manager of Lowood School. Mrs. Reed introduces Jane to him, painting her as a deceitful child with a bad disposition. Mr. Brocklehurst, a stern and hypocritical clergyman, questions Jane about her religious piety and then publicly labels her a liar, warning the other Lowood pupils to shun her. He orders her hair to be cut and the girls to dress plainly, despite his own family being splendidly attired. Miss Temple, the superintendent of Lowood, shows Jane kindness and believes her story after writing to Mr. Lloyd, who corroborates Jane's account. Jane is publicly cleared of the accusations and begins to excel in her studies, learning French and drawing.

Spring arrives at Lowood, but with it comes a typhus fever epidemic. Many girls fall ill and die, including Jane's friend, Helen Burns, who suffers from consumption. Jane visits Helen on her deathbed, where Helen speaks of her faith in God and the afterlife, comforting Jane. Helen dies peacefully in Jane's arms. The public inquiry into the typhus outbreak exposes the school's unhealthy conditions and Mr. Brocklehurst's mismanagement. New regulations are implemented, and the school improves significantly.

Jane remains at Lowood for eight more years, six as a pupil and two as a teacher. Miss Temple, her beloved instructress and friend, marries and leaves, prompting Jane to long for new experiences and a wider world. She places an advertisement in a newspaper for a governess position. She receives a reply from a Mrs. Fairfax at Thornfield Hall. After obtaining references and Mrs. Reed's reluctant permission, Jane leaves Lowood. Before her departure, Bessie (now married with children) visits her, revealing that Jane's uncle, Mr. John Eyre, had inquired about her years ago, but Mrs. Reed had falsely told him Jane was dead. Bessie also shares news of the Reed family's misfortunes: John Reed died by suicide after squandering his inheritance, and Mrs. Reed suffered a stroke and is gravely ill, asking for Jane.

Jane travels to Thornfield Hall, a large, old, somewhat gloomy mansion. She is warmly welcomed by Mrs. Fairfax, the housekeeper, whom she initially mistakes for the owner. Mrs. Fairfax clarifies that she is merely the housekeeper and that Jane's pupil, Adèle Varens, is Mr. Rochester's ward. Adèle, a lively French child, was brought to England by Mr. Rochester after her mother, Céline Varens, a French opera-dancer, abandoned her. Jane begins her duties as governess, finding Adèle docile. She also frequently hears a strange, mirthless laugh from the third storey of the house, which Mrs. Fairfax attributes to a servant named Grace Poole.

One evening, while out walking, Jane encounters a man whose horse has slipped on ice. She helps him, and later discovers he is Mr. Rochester, the master of Thornfield Hall, who has just returned. Mr. Rochester is a dark, stern, and peculiar man, but Jane finds him intriguing. He often engages Jane in conversation, revealing details of his past, including his passionate but ultimately disillusioned relationship with Céline Varens. He confesses to having a ""grande passion"" for Céline, who betrayed him with another man. He took Adèle in, though he doesn't believe he is her father, out of a sense of duty. He also hints at a ""hideous demon"" in his life and a desire for ""regeneration."" Jane finds herself falling in love with him, despite her efforts to suppress her feelings due to their differing social stations.

One night, Jane is awakened by a terrifying shriek and sounds of struggle from the third storey. She finds Mr. Rochester's room on fire and him unconscious. She extinguishes the flames and wakes him. He dismisses the incident as a servant's nightmare but later confesses to Jane that it was Grace Poole, a ""singular person,"" who set the fire. He makes Jane promise to keep silent about the true nature of the event.

Jane receives a summons to Gateshead, where Mrs. Reed is dying. She asks Mr. Rochester for leave, revealing her family connection to the Reeds. Mr. Rochester, initially reluctant, grants her leave, giving her money and promising to find her a new situation after his impending marriage. He also hints at his intention to marry Miss Ingram, a beautiful but haughty woman who has been a guest at Thornfield. Jane, heartbroken, believes he is marrying for social reasons, not love.

At Gateshead, Jane finds Eliza and Georgiana Reed cold and self-absorbed. Mrs. Reed, on her deathbed, confesses to Jane that she deliberately prevented Jane from inheriting her uncle's fortune by falsely telling him Jane was dead. She expresses her lifelong hatred for Jane, stemming from her dislike of Jane's mother and Mr. Reed's affection for Jane. Jane forgives Mrs. Reed, but Mrs. Reed dies without reciprocating. Eliza plans to enter a nunnery, and Georgiana seeks a wealthy husband.

Jane returns to Thornfield, only to find the hall a blackened ruin. She learns from the innkeeper that a fire, started by Mr. Rochester's mad wife, Bertha Mason, destroyed the house. Bertha, whom Mr. Rochester kept secretly confined on the third floor, escaped during Grace Poole's lapse in vigilance (due to drinking gin), set fire to the house, and then jumped from the roof to her death. Mr. Rochester, in his attempt to save her and the servants, lost an eye and a hand, and is now blind and crippled, living in a remote manor-house called Ferndean, attended only by old John and his wife.

Jane immediately travels to Ferndean. She finds Mr. Rochester, blind and disfigured, but recognizes him. He is initially unaware of her presence, mistaking her for his servant. When he realizes it is Jane, he is overcome with emotion, believing it to be a dream. Jane reassures him of her reality and reveals that her uncle, Mr. John Eyre, has died and left her a fortune of twenty thousand pounds, making her an ""independent woman.""

Jane declares her intention to stay with him as his companion, nurse, and eyes. Mr. Rochester, humbled by his suffering and Jane's unwavering love, proposes marriage again. Jane accepts, expressing her deep love and happiness. They marry in a quiet ceremony.

The story concludes ten years later. Jane and Mr. Rochester are happily married. Mr. Rochester regained partial sight in one eye and was able to see their first-born son, who inherited his eyes. They live a life of perfect concord and mutual devotion. Diana and Mary Rivers are also happily married. St. John Rivers went to India as a missionary, where he tirelessly works for God's kingdom, remaining unmarried and anticipating his own death in service. Jane also takes Adèle from her strict school and places her in a more indulgent one, eventually finding in her a pleasing companion."
Madame Bovary-Gustave Flaubert,"The story begins in a school classroom with the arrival of a new, awkward country boy named Charles Bovary. He is ridiculed by his classmates and master for his unusual cap and stammering. Despite a difficult start, Charles proves to be a conscientious student, though he began his education late due to his parents' financial constraints. His father, a retired assistant-surgeon-major, had squandered his wife's dowry and retired to a bitter, idle life in the country. Charles's mother, once lively, became resentful of her husband's infidelities and idleness, managing the household while he did nothing. Charles was initially spoiled, then neglected, and received irregular lessons from the local curé. He was eventually sent to a school in Rouen, where he was an unremarkable but steady student. After three years, his parents pulled him out to study medicine. In Rouen, Charles initially struggled with the demanding curriculum but eventually fell into idleness, frequenting public-houses and pursuing casual affairs. He failed his first medical examination but passed the second five years later after intense cramming.

Charles establishes his medical practice in Tostes, succeeding an old doctor whose death his mother had eagerly anticipated. His mother then arranges his marriage to Madame Dubuc, a forty-five-year-old widow with a modest income. Charles hopes for an easier life, but his wife is controlling, jealous, and constantly complains of ill health. She monitors his every move and criticizes his patients.

One night, Charles is called to the Bertaux farm to treat Monsieur Rouault for a broken leg. The journey is long and dark, worrying his wife, Heloise. At the farm, Charles is greeted by Monsieur Rouault's young daughter, Emma. Charles is struck by her appearance, particularly her delicate nails and candid, dark eyes. The fracture is simple, and Charles successfully treats it. He is invited to dine and observes Emma's disdain for country life. After the meal, a brief, accidental physical contact between them leaves Emma blushing. Charles begins visiting the Bertaux frequently, finding pleasure in Emma's company and the farm's atmosphere. His wife, Heloise, grows intensely jealous, accusing him of being infatuated with Emma and disparaging Emma's family. Under pressure, Charles promises Heloise he will stop visiting the Bertaux.

Soon after, Heloise's financial deceptions are exposed: her notary absconded with funds, and her property is heavily mortgaged. Charles's father is furious, blaming his wife for the poor match. Heloise falls ill with a spitting of blood, then faints and dies, leaving Charles surprised and saddened, realizing she had loved him.

After a period of mourning, old Rouault visits Charles, paying his medical bill and inviting him back to the Bertaux. Charles, now independent and with an increased practice due to public sympathy, resumes his visits. He finds Emma sewing in the kitchen, and they share a glass of liqueur, connecting over their shared dissatisfaction with provincial life and their romantic ideals. Charles becomes infatuated with Emma, constantly thinking of her and resolving to propose marriage, though his shyness prevents him. Old Rouault, facing financial difficulties and eager to marry off his daughter, subtly encourages Charles. Charles finally proposes to Monsieur Rouault, who, after a moment of suspense, signals Emma's acceptance by opening a window shutter. Their marriage is set for the following spring.

The wedding is a grand affair with forty-three guests, lasting for days. Emma, despite her romantic ideals, has a conventional wedding. Charles is openly affectionate, calling Emma ""my wife"" and embracing her frequently. Two days later, they leave for Tostes. Old Rouault, watching them go, reflects on his own past happiness.

In Tostes, Emma is disappointed by Charles's modest house and his mundane life. She immediately begins redecorating, seeking to transform their home into something more elegant. Charles is deeply happy, adoring Emma and finding joy in her presence. Emma, however, feels a profound sense of disillusionment, realizing that the ""felicity, passion, rapture"" she read about in books are absent from her marriage.

Emma's past is revealed: as a child, she devoured romantic novels and enjoyed the mystical atmosphere of the convent where she was educated. She dreamed of heroic lovers and grand passions, but found herself bored by the realities of country life. After her mother's death, she briefly embraced a dramatic melancholy, but eventually grew tired of it. Her religious fervor waned, and she rebelled against convent discipline. Returning home, she felt disillusioned, believing she had nothing left to learn or feel. Charles's presence, however, made her believe she was finally experiencing the ""wondrous passion"" of her dreams, but the calm of her life with him proved to be far from the happiness she envisioned.

Emma longs for an exotic, luxurious life, like those described in her novels. Charles's conversation is dull, and he lacks the accomplishments she desires in a man. She draws and plays the piano, which Charles admires, but she feels unfulfilled. She manages their household efficiently, raising Charles's standing in the community. Charles's mother visits, criticizing Emma's extravagance and feeling displaced in Charles's affections. Emma resents Charles's easy calm and his belief in her happiness. She attempts to force herself to love him, but his passion is merely a habit.

Emma takes solitary walks with her greyhound, Djali, contemplating her unhappiness and imagining a different life with a more exciting husband. She feels trapped by the ""ennui"" of her existence. One day, she receives an invitation to a ball at Vaubyessard, the estate of the Marquis d’Andervilliers, whom Charles had cured.

At the opulent château, Emma is overwhelmed by the luxury and refinement. She observes the distinguished guests, the elaborate dinner, and the old Duke de Laverdiere, a former court figure. She experiences new sensations, tasting iced champagne and exotic fruits. At the ball, Charles, awkward and out of place, is told by Emma not to dance. Emma, however, waltzes with a Viscount, feeling a ""torpor"" and briefly resting her head on his breast. The experience is intoxicating. As she watches peasants' faces pressed against the windows, her past life in the country seems to fade.

The next morning, after a quick luncheon and a tour of the stables, the Bovarys depart. Charles finds a green silk cigar case, emblazoned, containing two cigars, which he puts in his pocket. Upon returning home, Emma, furious that dinner isn't ready, fires her servant, Nastasie. She scornfully tells Charles he'll make himself ill smoking and throws the cigar case into the cupboard. The trip to Vaubyessard leaves a ""hole in her life,"" and the memory of the ball becomes an obsession, though details gradually fade.

Emma frequently retrieves the cigar case, imagining it belonged to the Viscount and was a love token. She dreams of Paris, buying maps and ladies' journals, seeking imaginary satisfaction for her desires. She compares her mundane life to the exciting world she reads about. She hires a young orphan, Félicité, and tries to turn her into a lady's-maid. Charles finds happiness in Emma's small domestic refinements, and his medical reputation grows. Emma, however, is increasingly irritated by Charles's vulgar habits and lack of ambition. She feels consumed by desires, rage, and hate, secretly in love with Léon. She watches Léon from afar, imagining a history for him, but suppresses her feelings, believing she has repulsed him. She feels a hypocritical pride in her ""virtue"" but is tormented by her unfulfilled desires. She blames Charles for her misery, wishing he would give her a reason to hate him. She is tempted to flee with Léon but is held back by fear and shame. She suffers from palpitations and spits blood, which Charles attributes to a nervous illness.

Charles, convinced her illness is due to Tostes, decides to move to Yonville-l’Abbaye, where a doctor has recently left. While packing, Emma finds a wire from her wedding bouquet and burns it, symbolizing the end of her illusions. Emma is pregnant when they leave Tostes.

They arrive in Yonville, a stagnant market town. Monsieur Homais, the local chemist, is a self-important, progressive-minded man who illegally practices medicine. He is overly helpful to Charles, hoping to gain his gratitude and prevent him from exposing his illegal activities. Léon Dupuis, a notary's clerk, is bored in Yonville and immediately drawn to Emma. At dinner, Emma and Léon connect over their shared romantic sensibilities and love for art and literature, contrasting with Charles's dullness and Homais's verbose pronouncements. Emma feels a new hope for happiness in Yonville.

Emma gives birth to a daughter, Berthe, and faints upon hearing it's a girl, having hoped for a son to fulfill her dreams of freedom. She struggles to name the child, eventually choosing Berthe. Homais, the godfather, gives pharmacy products as gifts. At the baptism dinner, Charles's father baptizes Berthe with champagne, angering the curé. Charles's father flirts with Emma, causing Charles's mother to hasten their departure.

Emma sends Berthe to a wet-nurse, Mere Rollet. She visits Berthe with Léon, and Madame Tuvache, the mayor's wife, gossips about Emma compromising herself. During their walk, Emma and Léon feel a growing unspoken connection. Léon, bored with Yonville, dreams of an artistic life in Paris. Emma, consumed by her love for Léon, secretly wishes he would declare himself.

Lheureux, the draper, visits Emma, offering her goods on credit and subtly hinting at her ""little fancies."" Emma, increasingly reckless with money, begins to accumulate debt. She uses the pretext of music lessons to travel to Rouen once a week to meet Léon. Their rendezvous take place in a hotel room, where they indulge in their passion. Emma is more charming than ever to Charles, who believes himself the most fortunate of men.

Léon's mother, receiving an anonymous letter, warns him about his affair. His employer also advises him to break it off. Léon, fearing for his career, becomes bored with Emma's emotional intensity and the ""platitudes of marriage"" he finds in adultery. Emma, sensing his waning interest, longs for a catastrophe to end the affair.

Emma's debts with Lheureux escalate. She is served a summons for eight thousand francs, threatening the seizure of her furniture. Panicked, she confronts Lheureux, who reveals he knows about her ""little theft"" (selling her gold chain) and threatens to expose her to Charles. Desperate, Emma tries to borrow money from Monsieur Guillaumin, the notary, who makes lewd advances, which she rejects with outrage.

In a fit of despair, Emma runs to Homais's shop, asks Justin for the key to the Capharnaum (Homais's private laboratory), and, finding a jar of arsenic, consumes the white powder. Justin tries to stop her, but she silences him, telling him not to blame his master. She returns home, strangely calm.

Charles, distraught by the news of the distraint, finds Emma out. He sends Félicité to search for her. When Emma returns, she writes a letter, seals it, and tells Charles to read it tomorrow. She lies down, feeling a bitter taste. She begins to vomit, experiencing intense pain and cold. Charles notices white sediment in the basin. She denies it's poison. Her condition rapidly deteriorates, with convulsions and screams. Charles, in agony, finds her letter, which reads: ""Accuse no one."" He realizes she has poisoned herself.

Homais and Canivet are called. Dr. Lariviere, Charles's old master, arrives, immediately recognizing the severity of the situation and declaring there is nothing more to be done. Emma's suffering intensifies. The curé administers extreme unction, anointing her eyes, nostrils, mouth, hands, and feet. As the blind man's song is heard from outside, Emma raises herself, laughs an ""atrocious, frantic, despairing laugh,"" and falls back dead.

Charles is inconsolable. Homais tries to manage the situation, inventing a story about Emma mistaking arsenic for sugar. Charles, in his grief, insists Emma be buried in her wedding dress with white shoes and a wreath. Homais and the curé argue over the funeral arrangements and religious matters. Charles's father arrives, deeply saddened. At the cemetery, Charles throws handfuls of earth into Emma's grave, crying ""Adieu!"" He is led away, feeling a vague satisfaction that it is over. Old Rouault, too, is devastated. Justin is discovered weeping at Emma's grave, revealing he was the one who stole the potatoes from the cemetery.

After Emma's death, Charles is consumed by grief. He refuses to sell her belongings, accumulating more debt. His mother leaves after a quarrel. Félicité runs away with Theodore, stealing Emma's remaining clothes. Charles receives news of Léon's marriage. He discovers Rodolphe's letter in Emma's desk, realizing her infidelity, but is too overwhelmed by sorrow to fully comprehend it, vaguely attributing it to ""fatality."" He adopts Emma's tastes, wearing patent leather boots and white cravats, as if she were still alive. He sells off his possessions piece by piece, but keeps Emma's room untouched. He spends his days with Berthe, who is neglected by the charwoman.

Homais, meanwhile, continues his campaign against the blind man, eventually having him confined to an asylum. This success emboldens Homais, who becomes a local public figure, writing articles and a book, and eventually receiving the cross of the Legion of Honour.

Charles, visiting the market, encounters Rodolphe. Charles, still grieving, stares at Rodolphe's face, seeing something of Emma in it. He tells Rodolphe he doesn't blame him, attributing Emma's fate to ""fatality."" The next day, Berthe finds Charles dead in the arbour, holding a tress of Emma's black hair. A post-mortem finds nothing.

After everything is sold, only twelve francs seventy-five centimes remain, used to send Berthe to her grandmother. The grandmother dies the same year, and old Rouault is paralyzed. Berthe is taken in by an aunt and sent to work in a cotton-factory. In Yonville, Homais prospers, becoming a respected figure, while three doctors fail to establish practices due to his attacks. He finally receives the cross of the Legion of Honour."
Mrs. Dalloway-Virginia Woolf,"The story begins on a mid-June morning with Clarissa Dalloway, a woman in her early fifties, deciding to buy flowers herself for a party she is hosting that evening. Her maid, Lucy, is busy preparing their Westminster home, as Rumpelmayer's men are coming to take doors off their hinges. Clarissa reflects on her youth at Bourton, recalling a vivid memory of bursting open French windows and feeling a sense of impending awe. She remembers Peter Walsh, an old friend who is expected to return from India, and his past comments to her.

As Clarissa walks through London, she is described as vivacious despite her age and recent illness. She observes the city's vibrant life, which she deeply loves, and notes the striking of Big Ben. She reflects on the recent end of the War, thinking of women like Mrs. Foxcroft and Lady Bexborough who lost loved ones. In the park, she encounters Hugh Whitbread, an old acquaintance, who informs her that his wife, Evelyn, is unwell and they are seeing doctors. Clarissa feels a familiar sense of inadequacy next to Hugh, but also a long-standing affection for him, contrasting him with her husband, Richard, who finds Hugh irritating, and Peter Walsh, who never forgave her for liking Hugh.

Clarissa's thoughts return to Peter Walsh and their past relationship. She recalls his intensity and her decision not to marry him, choosing instead the independence offered by Richard. She remembers a painful scene by a fountain at Bourton where she broke off their engagement, convinced that marrying Peter would have destroyed them both. She also recalls the ""horror"" of learning Peter married a woman he met on a boat to India, whom she dismisses as a ""silly, pretty, flimsy nincompoop."" She feels Peter, despite claiming happiness, has made a failure of his life.

At a bookshop, Clarissa looks for a book for Evelyn Whitbread but finds nothing suitable. She feels a familiar annoyance at herself for doing things to please others rather than for their own sake. She contemplates her identity as ""Mrs. Richard Dalloway,"" feeling a loss of her former self. Her thoughts then turn to Miss Kilman, her daughter Elizabeth's tutor, whom Clarissa intensely dislikes. She sees Miss Kilman as an embittered, religious, and domineering figure who inflicts ""positive torture"" with her sense of superiority and poverty. This hatred causes Clarissa physical pain.

Clarissa enters Mulberry's, a florist, where the beauty and scent of the flowers provide a temporary escape from her hatred. Suddenly, a violent explosion sounds from the street outside, making her jump. A motor car has stopped, and passers-by glimpse a ""face of the very greatest importance"" before the blinds are drawn. Rumours immediately spread about the identity of the occupant.

Septimus Warren Smith, a pale, apprehensive man in his early thirties, is among the onlookers. The event brings his world to a standstill, terrifying him as he feels he is being watched and is blocking the way. His young Italian wife, Lucrezia (Rezia), urges him to move on, but he is fixated. The car eventually proceeds, and Clarissa, leaving the florist, speculates it is the Queen. The car's passage leaves a profound emotional ripple through the city, touching on themes of empire and loss.

In Regent's Park, the same aeroplane that had been writing letters in the sky (which people variously interpret as ""Glaxo,"" ""Kreemo,"" or ""toffee"") appears to Septimus to be signalling directly to him with messages of ""unimaginable beauty."" Rezia, following Dr. Holmes's advice to engage Septimus with external things, points out the plane. Septimus perceives the world around him as alive, with trees and leaves connected to his body, and sparrows singing in Greek about the absence of crime and death. He believes he sees Evans, his dead friend from the War, behind the railings.

Rezia is increasingly distressed by Septimus's mental state, wishing he were dead rather than enduring his strange behaviour. She feels isolated and longs for her home in Milan. Septimus, meanwhile, scribbles revelations about God, love, and the world on envelopes, believing he is a ""lord of men"" chosen to hear the truth. He experiences intense visions and fears, including a dog turning into a man. He interprets everyday sounds as profound music or elegies.

Rezia attempts to connect with Septimus, but he remains lost in his delusions. He believes his marriage is over because she took off her wedding ring (she had put it in her purse because she had grown thin). He feels condemned for his inability to feel emotion, particularly after Evans's death in the war. He believes ""human nature"" (represented by doctors like Dr. Holmes and Sir William Bradshaw) is persecuting him. Dr. Holmes, whom Rezia finds kind, dismisses Septimus's symptoms as mere ""nerve symptoms"" and advises hobbies. Septimus, however, refuses to see Holmes again, feeling deserted and hearing voices telling him to kill himself.

A ""great revelation"" occurs for Septimus: Evans speaks from behind a screen. Rezia, terrified by his increasingly erratic behaviour, sends for Dr. Holmes, believing her husband is mad. When Holmes enters, Septimus cries out against him as a ""brute."" Dr. Holmes, amiable but dismissive, suggests Septimus needs rest in a home if he threatens suicide.

Big Ben strikes twelve, the hour Septimus and Rezia have an appointment with Sir William Bradshaw, a distinguished psychiatrist. Lady Bradshaw, waiting in their luxurious car, reflects on her husband's success and her own life. Sir William quickly diagnoses Septimus with a ""complete breakdown"" and, after speaking privately with Rezia, informs her that Septimus must go to a country home for a long rest, away from her. He calls Septimus's condition a ""lack of a sense of proportion"" rather than madness, and insists it's a matter of law due to the suicide threat. Rezia feels deserted and dislikes Sir William.

Sir William's philosophy is centred on ""Proportion,"" a goddess he worships, which dictates order, rest, and the control of ""unsocial impulses."" He also serves ""Conversion,"" a more formidable goddess who ""feasts on the wills of the weakly."" Lady Bradshaw herself, years ago, had her will slowly subsumed by her husband's.

Meanwhile, Hugh Whitbread and Richard Dalloway are at lunch with Lady Bruton. They discuss Peter Walsh's return, remembering his past love for Clarissa and his subsequent failures. Lady Bruton, who is focused on her project to emigrate young people to Canada, enlists Hugh to draft a letter to the _Times_. Richard finds Hugh pompous and his ideas ""stuffing and bunkum."" Richard, eager to reconnect with Clarissa, buys a large bunch of roses, intending to tell her ""I love you"" directly. He reflects on his own life as a miracle and his love for Clarissa and Elizabeth.

Back at Clarissa's house, Big Ben strikes three. Richard arrives with the roses, but cannot bring himself to say ""I love you."" Clarissa, however, understands his unspoken affection. They discuss the party, Peter's return, and Miss Kilman. Clarissa expresses her unhappiness about her parties being criticised and her dislike for Miss Kilman's influence on Elizabeth. She asserts that her parties are an ""offering"" for ""life"" itself.

Elizabeth, described as serious and mysterious, enters her mother's room. Miss Kilman, waiting outside, reflects on her own poverty, past injustices, and her newfound faith. She despises Clarissa's superficiality and desires to ""unmask"" and ""humiliate"" her. When Clarissa and Elizabeth emerge, Clarissa laughs at Miss Kilman, who feels insulted. Elizabeth and Miss Kilman leave for the Army and Navy Stores. Clarissa, in a ""violent anguish,"" cries out to Elizabeth to ""Remember the party!"" but Elizabeth doesn't answer. Clarissa then reflects on her hatred for ""love and religion,"" seeing them as cruel and destructive to the ""privacy of the soul.""

At the Stores, Miss Kilman buys petticoats and has tea with Elizabeth. Miss Kilman expresses her unhappiness and her desire for Elizabeth's affection, but Elizabeth feels a ""little flat"" and eventually leaves. Miss Kilman is left ""stricken"" by suffering, feeling Mrs. Dalloway has triumphed. She seeks solace in Westminster Abbey, praying to rid herself of hatred and love.

Elizabeth, enjoying her freedom, boards an omnibus, feeling a desire for a profession like a doctor or farmer. She returns home as Septimus is experiencing his final moments.

Septimus, back in his sitting-room, experiences a brief moment of clarity and happiness, designing a hat with Rezia. They laugh together, feeling a rare intimacy. But the arrival of the evening paper and the return of his visions shatter this peace. He feels utterly alone, the visions of Evans replaced by a mundane screen. Rezia, still happy from their shared moment, tries to engage him, but he is again fixated on the doctors. He feels trapped by Holmes and Bradshaw.

As Dr. Holmes approaches their door, Septimus, seeing no other escape, chooses to throw himself from the window onto Mrs. Filmer's area railings. Dr. Holmes bursts in, calling Septimus a ""coward."" Rezia runs to the window, sees, and understands. Dr. Holmes tells her Septimus is ""horribly mangled"" and will not recover, advising her not to see him. Rezia, in a daze, thinks of happy memories and Septimus's war service, accepting his death.

Later, at Clarissa's party, Peter Walsh hears the ambulance bell and reflects on civilisation and loneliness. He thinks of Clarissa's theory of the unseen self. He meets Sally Seton (now Lady Rosseter), who has married a rich man and has five sons. They reminisce about their youth, and Sally expresses her belief that Clarissa was a snob for not visiting her. Peter admits his life with Clarissa was complicated and ""spoilt his life.""

The Prime Minister arrives at Clarissa's party, creating a stir among the guests. Peter observes the ""snobbery of the English"" and Hugh Whitbread's obsequious behaviour. Clarissa, escorting the Prime Minister, feels a ""hollowness"" in her triumphs, and her hatred for Miss Kilman resurfaces.

Lady Bradshaw, speaking to Richard, reveals the news of a young man's suicide. Clarissa, hearing this in the middle of her party, is deeply affected. She retreats to a small room, feeling the party's splendour fall. She is angry the Bradshaws spoke of death. She visualises the young man's violent death, seeing it as an act of defiance, an attempt to communicate, an ""embrace in death."" She wonders if men like Sir William Bradshaw made life intolerable for him. She feels his death is ""her disaster--her disgrace,"" a punishment for her own past ambitions.

Looking out the window, Clarissa sees the old lady opposite going to bed, and finds a strange comfort in this quiet, private act. The clock strikes. She does not pity the young man, but feels ""somehow very like him"" and ""glad that he had done it; thrown it away."" The ""leaden circles dissolved in the air,"" and she feels ""the beauty; made her feel the fun."" She then returns to her party, needing to find Sally and Peter.

Peter, sitting with Sally, wonders where Clarissa has gone. Sally speculates Clarissa is with important people. They continue to discuss Clarissa and their past. Peter, feeling a mix of ""terror"" and ""ecstasy,"" realises the source of his extraordinary excitement: ""It is Clarissa,"" he says, as she appears."
Pride and Prejudice-Jane Austen,"The story begins by establishing a universally acknowledged truth: a single man of good fortune must be in want of a wife, and families in a neighborhood consider him rightful property for their daughters. Mrs. Bennet, upon hearing that Netherfield Park is let by a wealthy young, single man named Mr. Bingley, immediately sets her sights on him marrying one of her five daughters. Mr. Bennet, her husband, teases her about this, initially refusing to visit Mr. Bingley and suggesting he might send a note giving consent for Bingley to marry any of their daughters, with a special mention for Lizzy (Elizabeth). Mrs. Bennet is offended, claiming Lizzy is not as handsome as Jane or as good-humored as Lydia, and accuses Mr. Bennet of vexing her. Mr. Bennet is described as a man of sarcastic humor and reserve, while Mrs. Bennet is of ""mean understanding"" and obsessed with marrying her daughters.

Despite his teasing, Mr. Bennet secretly visits Mr. Bingley early on. He reveals this to his family later, much to Mrs. Bennet's astonishment and subsequent joy. The family then speculates about Mr. Bingley's return visit and a dinner invitation. Lady Lucas, a neighbor, provides a favorable report of Mr. Bingley, describing him as young, handsome, and agreeable, and confirms he will attend the next assembly with a large party. Mrs. Bennet hopes for one of her daughters to marry him.

Mr. Bingley returns Mr. Bennet's visit but only sees the father, disappointing the ladies who only glimpse him from a window. An invitation to dinner is sent, but Mr. Bingley declines, stating he must go to town. At the subsequent Meryton assembly, Mr. Bingley is lively, dances frequently, and is well-liked. He is accompanied by his two sisters, his brother-in-law Mr. Hurst, and his friend Mr. Darcy. Mr. Darcy, a tall, handsome man with a large fortune, initially draws admiration, but his proud, disagreeable manners quickly turn public opinion against him. He dances only twice and declines introductions to other ladies. Elizabeth overhears Darcy tell Bingley that Jane (the eldest Miss Bennet) is the ""only handsome girl in the room"" and that Elizabeth herself is ""tolerable: but not handsome enough to tempt _me_."" Elizabeth is not cordial towards Darcy but recounts the slight with spirit. The Bennet family returns home pleased with Jane's success with Mr. Bingley, who danced with her twice, but Mrs. Bennet expresses strong dislike for Mr. Darcy due to his rudeness.

Elizabeth and Jane discuss the ball. Jane expresses her strong admiration for Bingley, whom she finds sensible and well-bred. Elizabeth, while agreeing he is agreeable, notes Jane's tendency to see good in everyone. Elizabeth, however, finds Bingley's sisters proud and conceited. The text reveals Bingley inherited a large fortune and intends to buy an estate, while his sisters are anxious for him to do so. Darcy and Bingley have a steady friendship despite their contrasting characters: Bingley is open and liked, Darcy is haughty and often gives offense. Darcy admits Jane is pretty but smiles too much.

During a visit to the Lucas family, Charlotte Lucas reveals she overheard Bingley declare Jane the prettiest woman at the ball. Mrs. Bennet continues to express her dislike for Darcy, based on Mrs. Long's account of his silence. Charlotte defends Darcy's pride, saying he has a ""right"" to it given his status, but Elizabeth counters that she could forgive his pride if he hadn't ""mortified _mine_."" Mary offers a pedantic distinction between pride and vanity.

The Bennet ladies visit Netherfield. Elizabeth observes Jane is falling deeply in love with Bingley, but her composure hides it. Charlotte advises Jane to show more affection to secure Bingley, but Elizabeth believes Jane's genuine feelings are enough. Meanwhile, Mr. Darcy, who initially found Elizabeth only ""tolerable,"" begins to find her intelligent and her figure pleasing, and is caught by her ""easy playfulness,"" though Elizabeth remains unaware. At a party at Sir William Lucas's, Darcy listens to Elizabeth's conversation. Elizabeth playfully challenges him about his listening and later refuses to dance with him when Sir William tries to pair them. Miss Bingley, noticing Darcy's interest, tries to provoke him against Elizabeth by mocking her family, but Darcy's reply about ""fine eyes"" confirms his interest.

The Bennet family's financial situation is revealed: Mr. Bennet's estate is entailed to a distant male relation, Mr. Collins, leaving his daughters with only their mother's £4,000 fortune. The younger Bennet girls, Kitty and Lydia, are obsessed with the officers of a militia regiment in Meryton. Mr. Bennet disapproves of their silliness. Jane receives an invitation to dine at Netherfield. Mrs. Bennet, hoping Jane will stay overnight, insists she go on horseback in bad weather. Jane falls ill and must remain at Netherfield. Elizabeth, anxious, walks three miles to be with her sister, arriving with dirty clothes, which Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley view with contempt. Bingley, however, is kind and attentive. Jane's condition worsens, and Elizabeth stays to nurse her.

At Netherfield, Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley show superficial concern for Jane, restoring Elizabeth's dislike for them. Bingley, however, remains genuinely anxious for Jane. Miss Bingley criticizes Elizabeth's manners and appearance to Darcy, but Bingley defends Elizabeth. Miss Bingley then tries to draw Darcy into criticizing Elizabeth's ""low connections,"" mentioning her attorney and tradesman uncles. Darcy agrees that low connections lessen marriage prospects. Darcy and Miss Bingley discuss what constitutes an ""accomplished woman,"" with Darcy emphasizing ""extensive reading."" Elizabeth sarcastically comments on how few accomplished women they must know. Miss Bingley, jealous, attempts to provoke Darcy by suggesting Elizabeth undervalues her own sex to attract men. Darcy dismisses cunning. Jane's health improves slowly. Elizabeth sends a note to her mother, who visits with Kitty and Lydia. Mrs. Bennet, relieved Jane isn't in danger, hopes she won't recover too quickly, to keep her at Netherfield. Mrs. Bennet praises Netherfield and Bingley, and indiscreetly discusses her daughters' prospects. Darcy comments on the confined nature of country society, offending Mrs. Bennet. Lydia abruptly reminds Bingley of his promise to give a ball, which he agrees to do once Jane recovers.

Mr. Collins, the entailer of Longbourn, arrives. He is a pompous, obsequious clergyman under the patronage of Lady Catherine de Bourgh. He intends to marry one of the Bennet daughters as ""amends"" for inheriting their estate. After Mrs. Bennet informs him Jane is likely engaged, he sets his sights on Elizabeth. Mr. Bennet, amused by his absurdity, sends Mr. Collins with the girls to Meryton. There, they meet Mr. Wickham, a handsome and agreeable officer. Darcy and Bingley ride by, and Darcy and Wickham exchange a very cold, tense salutation, astonishing Elizabeth. At Mrs. Philips's house, Wickham sits with Elizabeth and reveals that Mr. Darcy, despite his father's intentions to provide for Wickham, withheld a valuable living and treated him cruelly due to a ""thorough, determined dislike"" and jealousy. Elizabeth believes Wickham and is filled with indignation against Darcy. Wickham also reveals Lady Catherine de Bourgh is Darcy's aunt and that Miss de Bourgh is expected to marry Darcy. Mr. Collins, overhearing Darcy is Lady Catherine's nephew, attempts to introduce himself to Darcy at the ball, despite Elizabeth's warnings, and is met with ""distant civility"" and contempt. At supper, Mrs. Bennet loudly discusses Jane's impending marriage to Bingley, mortifying Elizabeth, who sees Darcy overhearing. Mary's poor singing and Mr. Collins's long speeches further embarrass Elizabeth. Mr. Collins continues to pursue Elizabeth, preventing her from dancing with others. Bingley accepts Mrs. Bennet's invitation to dinner after his London trip.

Mr. Collins formally proposes to Elizabeth, citing his duty as a clergyman, his own happiness, and Lady Catherine's advice. He also mentions his desire to make amends for inheriting Longbourn. Elizabeth immediately refuses. Mr. Collins, however, misinterprets her refusal as female modesty and persistence. Elizabeth firmly reiterates her rejection, stating she cannot make him happy. Mr. Collins, still misinterpreting, suggests her small fortune makes another offer unlikely. Elizabeth declares her feelings forbid the match. Mrs. Bennet, upon learning of the refusal, is alarmed and insists Elizabeth accept. She appeals to Mr. Bennet, who, to her surprise, tells Elizabeth he will never see her again if she *does* marry Mr. Collins. Mr. Collins, his pride hurt, formally withdraws his proposal, transferring his attentions to Miss Lucas.

Charlotte Lucas, Elizabeth's friend, accepts Mr. Collins's proposal, seeking a ""comfortable home"" and an ""establishment"" as the only honorable provision for a woman of small fortune. Her family is overjoyed. Elizabeth is shocked and disappointed, believing Charlotte has sacrificed her feelings for worldly advantage. Mr. Collins writes to Mr. Bennet, expressing his happiness in his engagement and his intention to return to Longbourn. Mrs. Bennet is displeased by this news and by Bingley's continued absence.

Miss Bingley's letter confirms the Netherfield party is settled in London for the winter and that Bingley has no intention of returning. The letter also reveals Miss Bingley's hopes for Bingley to marry Miss Darcy. Jane is heartbroken, believing Bingley has forgotten her. Elizabeth, however, interprets the letter as Miss Bingley's scheme to separate Jane and Bingley due to their lower status and to promote a match with Miss Darcy. Mrs. Gardiner invites Jane to stay with them in London for a change of scene. During the Gardiners' stay at Longbourn, Wickham is a frequent visitor, and Mrs. Gardiner observes his attentions to Elizabeth, cautioning her against an imprudent attachment due to his lack of fortune. Elizabeth, however, learns that Wickham has shifted his attentions to Miss King, who has inherited £10,000. Elizabeth is not pained, believing her heart was only slightly touched, and finds Wickham's mercenary motive natural.

Elizabeth, Sir William, and Maria Lucas travel to Hunsford to visit the Collinses. Elizabeth observes Charlotte's contentment in her practical marriage. Lady Catherine frequently visits, offering unsolicited advice and dictating to everyone. Mr. Darcy and his cousin, Colonel Fitzwilliam, arrive at Rosings. Elizabeth meets them and observes Darcy's reserved behavior, but also his subtle attention to her. Colonel Fitzwilliam reveals that Darcy ""saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage,"" leading Elizabeth to realize Darcy was responsible for separating Bingley and Jane. She is filled with indignation, blaming Darcy's ""pride and caprice"" and his objections to Jane's low connections. This revelation causes Elizabeth a headache, preventing her from attending tea at Rosings.

Mr. Darcy unexpectedly visits Elizabeth while she is alone. He declares his ardent love for her, but his proposal is filled with references to her ""inferiority,"" the ""degradation"" of the match, and the ""family obstacles."" Elizabeth, angered by his insulting manner and his role in Jane's unhappiness, vehemently refuses him. She accuses him of ruining Jane's happiness and of reducing Wickham to poverty. Darcy, in turn, defends his actions regarding Jane, stating he believed her indifferent and was repulsed by her family's ""total want of propriety."" He admits to persuading Bingley against returning and concealing Jane's presence in London. He then refutes Wickham's accusations, revealing Wickham's profligacy, his acceptance of £3,000 in lieu of the church living, and his attempt to elope with Darcy's fifteen-year-old sister, Georgiana, for her £30,000 fortune. Darcy attributes his interference to his own mistaken pride in not exposing Wickham earlier. Elizabeth is overwhelmed by the revelations, realizing she had been ""blind, partial, prejudiced, absurd."" She feels immense shame for her past judgments and gratitude for Darcy's actions. Darcy, mortified by her refusal, hastily leaves.

Elizabeth is deeply affected by Darcy's letter and her own misjudgment. She studies the letter, her feelings for Darcy fluctuating between indignation and a growing respect and gratitude. She realizes her family's impropriety justified some of Darcy's concerns about Jane's marriage. Darcy and Colonel Fitzwilliam leave Rosings. Lady Catherine, feeling dull, invites the Collinses and Elizabeth to dine again. Lady Catherine continues to give unsolicited advice. Elizabeth reflects on her family's defects and the pain Jane has suffered due to Darcy's interference.

Elizabeth, Maria, and Sir William return to London. Lydia, Kitty, and Jane return to Longbourn. Lydia excitedly reveals that the militia regiment is leaving Meryton for Brighton, and she has been invited to accompany Mrs. Forster. Elizabeth is horrified by the prospect of Lydia's unrestrained behavior in Brighton and tries to persuade her father to prevent it, but Mr. Bennet dismisses her concerns. Elizabeth has a final encounter with Wickham, during which she subtly reveals her knowledge of his true character, making him uncomfortable. Lydia departs for Brighton.

Elizabeth tells Jane about Darcy's letter regarding Wickham. Jane is shocked by Wickham's wickedness but tries to find good in him. Elizabeth decides against publicly exposing Wickham, as Darcy did not authorize it and the prejudice against Darcy is too strong. Jane remains unhappy about Bingley's absence. Mrs. Bennet continues to lament Jane's misfortune and speculates about the Collinses' finances.

The regiment leaves Meryton. Lydia's letters from Brighton are frivolous, detailing officers and parties. A letter from Mr. Gardiner brings dreadful news: Lydia has eloped with Wickham. A second letter reveals they are not married and Wickham never intended to marry her. The family is in deep distress. Mr. Bennet and Colonel Forster go to London to search for them. Mr. Gardiner joins Mr. Bennet in London. Mr. Collins sends a condescending letter, expressing sympathy but also blaming Lydia's ""licentiousness"" and warning of the disgrace to the family, while expressing satisfaction that he was not involved. Mr. Gardiner's investigations reveal Wickham has considerable gaming debts. Mr. Bennet returns home, spiritless, and places restrictions on Kitty's social life. Elizabeth feels immense shame and believes her knowledge of Darcy's character makes Lydia's infamy even more painful, creating an ""impassable gulf"" between them.

Mr. Gardiner's next letter brings good news: he has found Lydia and Wickham. They are not married, but Mr. Gardiner has negotiated terms for their marriage: Mr. Bennet must settle Lydia's share of £5,000 and allow her £100 per annum. Wickham's debts will be paid, and he will receive some money. Elizabeth realizes her uncle must have paid a significant sum. Mrs. Bennet is ecstatic about Lydia's marriage, completely forgetting her misconduct. Mr. Bennet, though ashamed of Wickham, agrees to the terms. Elizabeth is humbled and grateful to Darcy, realizing he must have paid Wickham's debts and secured the marriage for her sake, despite the disgrace of the connection. Mr. Gardiner's letter also states Wickham will quit the militia and join the Regulars in the north. Jane and Elizabeth persuade Mr. Bennet to receive Lydia and Wickham at Longbourn after their marriage.

Lydia and Wickham arrive at Longbourn as a married couple. Mrs. Bennet welcomes them with rapture, but Mr. Bennet, Elizabeth, and Jane are disgusted by their easy assurance and Lydia's unabashed, wild behavior. Lydia boasts about her wedding and accidentally reveals that Mr. Darcy was present and was to give her away if her uncle couldn't. Elizabeth, burning with curiosity, writes to Mrs. Gardiner for an explanation. Mrs. Gardiner's reply reveals the full extent of Darcy's involvement: he purposely sought out Lydia and Wickham in London, found Wickham through Mrs. Younge (Miss Darcy's former governess whom Wickham had used in his elopement attempt with Georgiana), and negotiated with Wickham to marry Lydia, paying off his considerable debts and purchasing his commission. Darcy explained he did this because he felt his own pride and reserve had prevented Wickham's true character from being known, thus contributing to Lydia's misfortune. Elizabeth is overwhelmed with gratitude and love for Darcy, realizing his noble character and the depth of his affection.

News spreads that Mr. Bingley is returning to Netherfield. Mrs. Bennet is excited, but Jane tries to appear indifferent. Bingley and Darcy visit Longbourn. Bingley's admiration for Jane rekindles. Elizabeth is vexed by Darcy's reserved behavior, but at dinner, Bingley sits by Jane, and Elizabeth observes Darcy's ""noble indifference"" to her, yet also his ""half-laughing alarm."" Mrs. Bennet's rudeness to Darcy pains Elizabeth. Darcy is silent and thoughtful.

A few days later, Bingley calls alone. Darcy has gone to London but will return. Mrs. Bennet, eager to leave Jane and Bingley alone, orchestrates their privacy. Bingley proposes to Jane, and she accepts, becoming ""the happiest creature in the world."" Elizabeth is delighted. Mr. Bennet gives his consent, teasing Jane about her complying temper. Mrs. Bennet is in ecstasy, focusing on Bingley's wealth and Jane's beauty. Bingley becomes a daily visitor. Jane learns from Bingley that he was ignorant of her being in London, and attributes his absence to his sisters' interference. Elizabeth is pleased Darcy did not betray his own interference.

Lady Catherine de Bourgh makes an unexpected visit to Longbourn, having heard a ""most alarming report"" that Elizabeth is to marry Mr. Darcy. She confronts Elizabeth, demanding to know if Darcy has proposed and insisting Elizabeth promise never to accept him, citing Darcy's supposed engagement to her daughter and Elizabeth's inferior connections and family disgrace (Lydia's elopement). Elizabeth, with dignity and firmness, refuses to make any such promise, asserting her right to choose. Lady Catherine, highly incensed, leaves without taking leave. Mr. Bennet receives a letter from Mr. Collins, congratulating him on Jane's marriage and hinting at Elizabeth's supposed engagement to Darcy, while also criticizing Mr. Bennet for receiving Lydia. Mr. Bennet is amused, but Elizabeth is mortified.

Bingley brings Darcy to Longbourn. Elizabeth, finding herself alone with Darcy, thanks him for his kindness to Lydia. Darcy admits his actions were partly motivated by his ""wish of giving happiness to you"" and that he thought only of *her*. He then re-proposes, stating his affections and wishes are ""unchanged."" Elizabeth, her sentiments having undergone a material change, accepts him with ""gratitude and pleasure."" Darcy explains that Lady Catherine's interference, by demanding Elizabeth promise not to marry him, actually gave him hope, as it showed Elizabeth was not ""absolutely, irrevocably decided against me."" Darcy also confesses his past pride and selfishness, crediting Elizabeth with humbling him. He reveals he confessed to Bingley his mistake in supposing Jane indifferent, leading to Bingley and Jane's engagement.

Elizabeth tells Jane about her engagement to Darcy. Jane is incredulous at first, but then delighted. Elizabeth reveals Darcy's full role in securing Lydia's marriage. Mrs. Bennet is initially displeased to see Darcy, but upon learning of Elizabeth's engagement, she is ecstatic about his wealth and status. Mr. Bennet gives his consent, teasing Elizabeth but ultimately approving.

In the conclusion, Mrs. Bennet remains silly but happy with her two eldest daughters married. Mr. Bennet enjoys visiting Pemberley. Bingley and Jane eventually move to an estate closer to Derbyshire. Kitty, removed from Lydia's influence, improves her character. Mary remains at home, forced to socialize more. Wickham and Lydia's characters do not change; they are extravagant and often need financial assistance from Elizabeth and Jane. Darcy assists Wickham in his profession. Miss Bingley, though mortified by Darcy's marriage, drops her resentment to maintain access to Pemberley. Georgiana and Elizabeth become close. Lady Catherine is initially indignant about Darcy's marriage but eventually reconciles, visiting them at Pemberley. The Gardiners remain intimate friends with Darcy and Elizabeth, who are grateful for their role in bringing them together."
Robinson Crusoe-Daniel Defoe,"The narrative begins with Robinson Crusoe, born in York in 1632, recounting his early life. Despite his father's earnest advice to pursue a stable ""middle state"" in life and his mother's entreaties, Crusoe, at eighteen, is consumed by a desire to go to sea. His father, a wise and grave man, had warned him against such a life, citing the tragic death of Crusoe's elder brother in war as an example, and was deeply saddened by his son's obstinacy.

Almost a year later, in September 1651, Crusoe, without his parents' consent, embarks on a ship from Hull to London with a companion. A violent storm strikes, causing him immense fear and seasickness, leading him to vow repentance and a return home if spared. The storm abates, but his companion's mockery and a shared bowl of punch lead him to forget his resolutions. A second, more terrible storm hits at Yarmouth Roads, disabling their ship. All eleven men are eventually rescued by a boat from another ship just before their own vessel sinks. Despite this near-fatal experience and warnings from the master's son, Crusoe's ""ill fate"" and shame prevent him from returning home. He travels to London, still determined to go to sea.

He embarks on a voyage to Guinea (the coast of Africa) as a gentleman passenger. His first trip is successful; he invests £40 in goods, which, through the honest captain's guidance, yields nearly £300 in gold dust. He also gains some navigation knowledge. However, the captain dies, and Crusoe, now a ""Guinea trader,"" undertakes a second voyage with the former mate as captain. This ship is attacked by a Turkish rover from Sallee. After a fierce battle, their ship is captured, and Crusoe is taken prisoner and made a slave by the rover's captain.

For two years, he is kept ashore, tending a garden or looking after the ship, constantly plotting escape but finding no opportunity. An opportunity arises when his master frequently takes him and a young Moorish boy, Xury, fishing in the ship's pinnace. One day, when sent out alone with the Moor and Xury, Crusoe tricks the Moor into bringing extra provisions and arms. Once at sea, he throws the Moor overboard, threatening him with a gun to swim to shore, which the Moor does. He then secures Xury's loyalty with promises.

Crusoe and Xury sail south along the African coast. They land for fresh water, encountering terrifying wild animals. Crusoe shoots a monstrous creature (believed to be a lion) that approaches their boat. Later, they encounter natives who trade dried meat and corn for Crusoe's assistance in killing a leopard that attacks them. The natives are astonished by his gun. Continuing south, they eventually sight the Cape de Verde Islands.

Xury spots a Portuguese ship, and Crusoe signals for help. He is rescued by a kind Portuguese captain, who takes him and his goods to Brazil, refusing payment. In Brazil, Crusoe sells his salvaged goods and skins, accumulating wealth. He settles as a planter, buying land and acquiring a negro slave and a European servant. After four years of successful planting, his restless nature leads him to agree to a secret proposal from other planters to act as supercargo on a slave-trading voyage to Guinea. He makes arrangements for his plantation and a will, then embarks on September 1, 1659, exactly eight years after his first voyage.

A violent hurricane strikes, driving the ship westward. One man dies, and two are lost overboard. The ship is severely damaged. Another storm hits, and the ship strikes a sandbank. Crusoe and ten other men launch a boat, but a massive wave overturns it, drowning everyone but Crusoe. He is miraculously swept ashore, half-dead but alive.

Alone on a desolate island, he finds no food or weapons, only a knife and tobacco. He spends his first night sleeping in a tree for safety. The next morning, he discovers the ship has floated closer to shore. He swims to the wreck and, over several days, makes multiple trips using rafts to salvage provisions (biscuit, rum, cheese, dried meat, corn), tools (carpenter's chest, grindstone, hatchets, saws), arms (muskets, pistols, powder, shot, swords), clothes, bedding, and even money, which he initially deems useless. On his last trip, a storm breaks up the ship, and it disappears.

He builds a fortified habitation: a tent under a rock, surrounded by a double fence of stakes and cables, with a cave behind it. He divides his gunpowder into many small parcels and hides them after a lightning storm makes him fear an explosion. He hunts goats, learning their habits, and kills a she-goat and her kid. He reflects on his desperate condition but also on God's providence in saving him and providing supplies. He sets up a calendar by notching a post. He makes a wooden shovel and a hod for digging. He makes a table and a chair. He discovers barley and rice stalks growing from discarded chicken feed, which he carefully saves for future planting.

An earthquake severely damages his cave, causing him to fear being buried alive. He resolves to build a safer dwelling but is reluctant to leave his concealed spot. He invents a foot-powered grindstone to sharpen his tools. He falls ill with an ague and fever, prompting a profound spiritual awakening. He prays earnestly, reads the Bible, and finds comfort and a new understanding of ""deliverance"" as freedom from sin. He learns to make earthenware pots that can withstand fire and constructs a wooden mortar and pestle for grinding corn, and sieves from old neckcloths. He devises a method to bake bread using hot pots and embers.

He cultivates his crops, learning the island's two rainy and two dry seasons. He protects his corn from goats and birds, even hanging shot birds as scarecrows. His corn harvest increases significantly. He attempts to build a large canoe to reach the mainland but fails to launch it, realizing his folly in not planning for its movement. He builds a smaller canoe and uses it to explore around the island. During this voyage, a strong current sweeps him far out to sea, terrifying him. He repents his unthankfulness and is miraculously returned to the island by a counter-current.

He returns to his bower, where his parrot, Poll, surprises him by calling his name, a phrase Crusoe had taught him. He becomes more content with his solitary life, improving his skills in various crafts. His ammunition dwindles, leading him to devise pit traps to catch and tame goats, eventually building a large enclosure and establishing a thriving flock, providing him with meat, milk, butter, and cheese.

In his twenty-third year, he discovers a fire on his side of the island. He observes nine naked savages engaged in a cannibal feast. He is horrified and resolves to remain concealed, moving his boat to a hidden cove. He plans to ambush the savages but reconsiders the morality of it, deciding to leave their judgment to God. He finds a natural cave in the woods, which he uses as a secure, concealed magazine for his powder and spare arms.

In his twenty-fourth year, he hears gunshots at sea during a storm. He lights a signal fire and the next day discovers the wreck of a Spanish ship. He visits the wreck, rescues a starving dog, and finds two drowned men. He salvages some useful items, including money, which he still considers worthless compared to practical necessities.

Two years later, he dreams of rescuing a savage from cannibals. This dream inspires him to actively seek an opportunity for a servant and companion. After a year and a half of waiting, he sees five canoes and thirty savages on the shore, preparing to eat three prisoners. One prisoner escapes and runs towards his dwelling. Crusoe, feeling a divine call, intervenes, shooting two of the pursuers. The rescued savage, whom Crusoe names Friday, pledges eternal servitude by placing Crusoe's foot on his head. Friday, at Crusoe's command, kills the stunned third pursuer. They bury the bodies.

Crusoe takes Friday to his cave, gives him clothes, and begins teaching him English and Christian religion. Friday quickly learns and becomes a loyal, loving servant. Friday reveals that his nation also eats captives but only those taken in war. He also tells Crusoe about ""white bearded men"" (Spaniards) living on the mainland, who were shipwrecked and saved by his people.

Crusoe and Friday build a large canoe suitable for a voyage to the mainland. Crusoe teaches Friday how to sail. In his twenty-seventh year, with his deliverance seemingly at hand, Crusoe agrees to send Friday's father and the rescued Spaniard to the mainland to bring back the other sixteen Spaniards and Portuguese, on the condition that they swear loyalty to Crusoe and agree to his command. They sow extra crops to feed the expanded group.

Eight days after their departure, Crusoe sees an English ship and boat approaching. He is suspicious, believing them to be mutineers. He hides and observes. The boat lands, carrying eleven men, three of whom are bound prisoners. The mutineers carelessly let their boat get stranded by the tide. Crusoe approaches the three prisoners, who turn out to be the ship's captain, his mate, and a passenger, marooned by their mutinous crew.

Crusoe, with Friday, the captain, and his two loyal men, plans an attack. They disable the mutineers' boat. They ambush the mutineers, killing some and capturing others. The captain, under Crusoe's direction, offers mercy to those who submit, except for the ringleaders. He pretends Crusoe is the ""governor"" of the island with a large army. The mutineers surrender. The worst mutineers are imprisoned in the cave, while others are brought to the bower.

Crusoe reveals his identity and his long history on the island to the captain. He shows him his fortifications and all his ingenious contrivances. The captain is amazed. They devise a plan to retake the ship, which still has twenty-six mutineers on board. They lure the remaining mutineers ashore, capture them, and successfully board the ship at midnight, killing the new rebel captain and securing the vessel.

The captain fires seven guns, the agreed-upon signal of success. Crusoe, now openly the ""Governor,"" is overjoyed. The captain brings him fresh clothes, food, and cordial waters from the ship. Crusoe then offers the captured mutineers a choice: be taken to England for trial and hanging, or be left on the island. They choose to stay. He gives them firearms, ammunition, tools, and instructions for living on the island, including how to manage the goats and cultivate crops. He also leaves a letter for the expected Spaniards, instructing the mutineers to treat them as comrades.

Crusoe leaves the island on December 19, 1686, after twenty-eight years, two months, and nineteen days, taking his goat-skin cap, umbrella, a parrot, and his money as relics. He arrives in England on June 11, 1687, after thirty-five years' absence. He finds his father and mother dead, but two sisters and two nephews are alive. He helps his old widow benefactor and receives £200 from the ship owners.

He travels to Lisbon to inquire about his Brazil plantation. He reunites with his old Portuguese captain, who informs him that his plantation has thrived, making his partner rich, but his original trustees are dead. His share of the profits had been appropriated by the king and a monastery. The captain, having used some of Crusoe's money after his own shipwreck, repays him and offers security in his son's ship. Crusoe, moved by the captain's honesty, generously rewards him with an annuity and releases him from debt.

Crusoe receives a large sum of money from his plantation's profits and sells his estate in Brazil for 33,000 pieces of eight, securing annuities for the old captain and his son. He is now wealthy but feels a restlessness and a desire to see his island again. After seven years in England, during which he marries, has three children, and his wife dies, he embarks on another voyage to the East Indies in 1694 with his nephew.

On this voyage, he revisits his island colony. He finds the Spaniards and the mutineers living there, having experienced conflicts, battles with Caribbeans, and significant improvements to the island. He finds about twenty young children on the island. He stays for twenty days, leaving them supplies, arms, tools, a carpenter, and a smith. He divides the land among them and secures their commitment to stay. He then travels to Brazil, buys a bark, and sends more people (including seven women), cows, sheep, and hogs to the island. He learns of a major Caribbee invasion that ruined plantations, but the islanders, after initial defeat, fought back and recovered their settlement after a storm destroyed the invaders' canoes.

The narrative concludes by stating that these and further adventures will be detailed in the Second Part of his Story."
Six Characters in Search of an Author-Luigi Pirandello,"The play begins with a theatrical company rehearsing ""Mixing It Up,"" a play by Pirandello, on a stage that is half-dark and empty. The Manager expresses his frustration with the abstract nature of the play, particularly the requirement for the Leading Man to wear a cook's cap and beat eggs, which he finds ridiculous. He attempts to explain the play's themes of ""empty form of reason"" and ""fullness of instinct"" to his bewildered actors.

During this rehearsal, six mysterious figures, referred to as the Six Characters, enter the stage. They are: The Father (a man of about 50), The Mother (crushed and terrified, dressed in black mourning), The Step-Daughter (dashing, impudent, also in mourning), The Boy (14, timid, in black), The Child (about 4, in white with a black sash), and The Son (22, severe, contemptuous). They are surrounded by a faint, dream-like light.

The Father explains to the astonished Manager that they are ""characters in search of an author"" because the author who created them alive either no longer wished or was unable to complete their drama. The Step-Daughter eagerly suggests they can be the company's new play. The Manager initially dismisses them as mad, but The Father argues that characters, once born, are more real and enduring than actual people, and they desire to live out their drama through the actors.

The Step-Daughter, with a mix of disdain and allure, begins to reveal their story, even singing and dancing briefly. She states she is a two-months' orphan and hints at a dark drama involving the eventual death of the Child and the Boy's ""stupidest things."" She bitterly declares that she, the Boy, and the Child are ""bastards"" and accuses The Son of despising them and their common mother.

The Mother, overwhelmed, nearly faints. The Father attempts to comfort her and lift her veil, which she resists, begging the Manager to prevent The Father from carrying out his ""loathsome"" plan. The Manager learns that The Mother is The Father's wife, which confuses him since The Father is alive, but The Step-Daughter clarifies that The Mother's lover (her father) died two months ago.

The Father explains that The Mother's true drama lies in her four children by two men. The Mother vehemently states that The Father ""forced me to go away with him"" and gave her to the other man. The Step-Daughter denies this, claiming The Mother says it to gain sympathy from The Son, whom she abandoned when he was two. The Step-Daughter asserts that The Mother lived happily with her (the Step-Daughter's) father.

The Father confesses he married The Mother for her humility but later sent her away with his secretary (her lover) because their silent communication exasperated him. He also sent The Son away to the country for his upbringing. The Step-Daughter mocks The Father's ""moral sanity,"" revealing his visits to Madame Pace's shop, a place that caters to ""poor girls of good family."" The Father defends his ""incongruity"" as proof of his humanity.

The Step-Daughter then reveals that after her father (The Mother's lover) died, The Mother and her children returned in poverty. The Mother worked as a modiste for Madame Pace, who exploited The Step-Daughter. The drama culminates when The Father, driven by ""miserable flesh,"" encounters The Step-Daughter in Madame Pace's shop, where he was about to proposition her with money. The Mother arrived ""in time"" to witness the near-shameful encounter, and The Father, recognizing her, took them all back to his house.

The Father explains that the drama stems from his conscience and the ""many-sided"" nature of identity, feeling trapped by the shameful reality The Step-Daughter now attaches to him. The Son, however, expresses profound disgust, claiming he has nothing to do with their ""vulgar"" affairs and considers himself an ""unrealized"" character. The Step-Daughter accuses The Son of making her life on the streets by denying them a proper home. The Father highlights the Boy's painful humiliation at being brought into the home ""out of charity."" He reveals that the Child and Boy will eventually ""disappear"" from the scene, and the drama will end with the Mother, Son, and Father remaining, estranged from each other.

Intrigued, the Manager agrees to try staging their drama, suggesting he will act as their author, taking down the scenes as they play them. The actors are skeptical and dismissive of this ""madness.""

After a brief intermission, the Step-Daughter, Child, and Boy emerge from the Manager's office, with the Step-Daughter expressing her frustration with the Manager's attempts to ""arrange everything."" She finds a revolver in the Boy's pocket and suggests he should have used it on The Father and Son. The Son expresses his shame at having their private lives exposed on stage.

The Manager begins to set the stage for Madame Pace's shop. The Characters argue with him and the Property Man about the details of the set, insisting on accuracy. The Father and Step-Daughter express their discomfort with the actors portraying them, arguing that the actors cannot truly capture their inner reality. The Father suggests hanging the actresses' hats and a mantle on pegs, believing it might conjure Madame Pace herself. Miraculously, Madame Pace appears, speaking in a comical half-Italian, half-Spanish jargon. The Mother, seeing Madame Pace, erupts in a fit of rage, calling her a ""devil"" and ""murderess,"" and Madame Pace, offended, exits.

The Step-Daughter then directs The Father in the scene of their encounter at Madame Pace's shop. The Father, initially hesitant, becomes more natural as he acts. The Mother watches in anguish, sobbing. The scene progresses to The Father offering The Step-Daughter a hat, which she refuses due to her mourning. The Manager, pleased, attempts to modify the scene, but The Step-Daughter insists on the ""truth"" of The Father's proposition to ""take off this little frock,"" and her subsequent shame. The Manager finds this ""impossible"" for the stage.

The Step-Daughter, furious, threatens to leave, accusing the Manager of wanting to stage The Father's ""cerebral drama"" and ""remorses"" while ignoring her ""part"" and the true horror of her situation. She asserts that The Father is responsible for all her subsequent ""faults."" The Mother, overcome, cries, stating her torment is ""not a pretended one"" and that the children keep her suffering ""actual and vivid."" The Father explains that The Step-Daughter wants to fix him ""eternally in the stocks"" for his shameful moment. The Step-Daughter describes her disgust at The Father's touch and urges The Mother to ""Cry out as you did then!"" The Mother, in a fit of emotion, separates The Step-Daughter from The Father, calling him a ""brute."" The Manager, thrilled, declares ""curtain!"" but the Machinist mistakenly drops the curtain completely.

When the curtain rises again, the stage is set as a garden with trees and a fountain. The Characters continue to argue with the Manager about the staging of the second act. The Step-Daughter insists that The Son is always in his room and the Boy's part takes place indoors, making a garden setting problematic. The Father objects to the word ""illusion,"" asserting that for the Characters, their drama is their ""sole reality,"" unlike the actors' ""game of art."" He argues that human reality is fleeting, while their reality as characters is ""immutable"" and ""fixed for ever.""

The Manager, exasperated by The Father's philosophizing, urges them to focus on the action. The Step-Daughter describes her only pleasure as seeing the Child ""happy and careless in the garden"" after their previous misery. The Manager decides to stage everything in the garden, with the Boy hiding behind trees.

The Manager tries to direct the Boy, but The Step-Daughter states he won't speak as long as The Son is present. The Son eagerly offers to leave, but the Manager stops him. The Step-Daughter ironically states The Son ""can't go away! He is obliged to stay here, indissolubly bound to the chain."" The Mother, despite her reluctance, agrees to act her part, approaching The Son. The Son, however, remains resolute, declaring, ""I act nothing!"" The Father tries to force him, leading to a physical struggle between them, which The Mother tries to break up. The Son accuses The Father of indecency for exposing their shame and claims he stands for the author's will not to put them on stage.

The Manager presses The Son to reveal what happened after The Mother entered his room. The Son reluctantly admits he went ""walking in the garden."" The Manager, noticing The Mother's trembling and glance towards the fountain, asks about ""The baby?"" The Son reveals, ""There in the fountain...."" The Father adds that The Mother was following him. The Son then describes running to save the Child, but seeing ""the boy there standing stock still, with eyes like a madman's, watching his little drowned sister, in the fountain!""

As The Step-Daughter bends over the fountain, sobbing, a revolver shot rings out from behind the trees where the Boy is hidden. The Mother screams and runs towards the sound. Some actors declare the Boy ""dead! dead!"" while others insist, ""No, no, it's only make believe, it's only pretence!"" The Father cries out, ""Pretence? Reality, sir, reality!"" The Manager, utterly exasperated and frustrated, exclaims, ""Pretence? Reality? To hell with it all! Never in my life has such a thing happened to me. I've lost a whole day over these people, a whole day!"" The curtain falls."
The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn-Mark Twain,"The story begins with the narrator, Huckleberry Finn (Huck), introducing himself and referencing a previous book, *The Adventures of Tom Sawyer*, which detailed how he and Tom found a robbers' hidden money in a cave, making them rich with $6,000 apiece. Judge Thatcher invested their money, yielding a dollar a day. The Widow Douglas adopted Huck to ""sivilize"" him, but he found her ways too restrictive and ran away. Tom Sawyer convinced him to return by promising he could join a band of robbers.

Huck returned to the Widow, enduring her attempts to civilize him, including lessons from her sister, Miss Watson. Miss Watson's talk of heaven and hell made Huck wish for the ""bad place"" if Tom Sawyer wouldn't be in the ""good place."" Feeling lonesome and scared by night sounds and a bad omen (a spider burning in a candle), Huck performed rituals to ward off bad luck. He then met Tom Sawyer by mimicking a cat's meow.

Tom and Huck crept through the Widow's garden. Huck tripped, alerting Miss Watson's ""big nigger,"" Jim, who was in the kitchen doorway. Jim investigated, but Huck and Tom remained still until he fell asleep. Tom played a trick on Jim by hanging his hat on a tree limb above him. Jim later embellished this into a tale of witches riding him across the state, making him a respected figure among other ""niggers"" and leading him to wear a five-cent piece as a charm.

Huck and Tom met other boys, including Joe Harper and Ben Rogers. They went to a cave and formed ""Tom Sawyer's Gang,"" swearing an oath in blood to keep secrets and kill anyone who wronged a member or their family. Huck, lacking a family, offered Miss Watson as his ""family"" to be killed. The gang decided to be ""highwaymen,"" robbing stages and carriages, killing people, and sometimes ""ransoming"" them (which Tom admitted he didn't fully understand, suggesting it meant keeping them until they died). Little Tommy Barnes cried and wanted to quit, but Tom bribed him. They planned to meet again.

Months passed. Huck attended school, learning to read and write a little. He grew somewhat accustomed to the Widow's ways but still preferred his old life. One morning, he spilled salt, a bad omen. He then found tracks in the snow with a cross in the boot-heel, recognizing them as his Pap's. Fearing Pap would take his money, Huck ran to Judge Thatcher and insisted on giving all his $6,000 to the Judge, who ""bought"" it for a dollar. That night, Huck consulted Jim's ""hair-ball"" (a magical ox hairball) about Pap's intentions. After Huck provided a counterfeit quarter (which Jim prepared by sticking it in a potato), the hair-ball prophesied Huck would face trouble and joy, marry a poor girl then a rich one, and should avoid water as he was destined to be hung. Huck then found Pap in his room.

Pap, a disheveled, abusive drunk, criticized Huck's ""starchy clothes"" and education, threatening to beat him if he continued school. He demanded Huck's money, which he believed Judge Thatcher held. Pap took Huck's dollar and left for whiskey. The Judge and Widow attempted to gain legal guardianship of Huck, but a new judge refused to separate father and son. Pap, pleased, continued to demand money from Huck, getting drunk and jailed repeatedly. The new judge tried to reform Pap, but he quickly relapsed, trading his new clothes for whiskey, breaking his arm, and nearly freezing.

Pap then abducted Huck, taking him three miles upriver to a secluded log hut on the Illinois shore. He kept Huck captive, locking him in and frequently leaving to trade fish and game for whiskey, returning to get drunk and beat Huck. Huck grew to prefer this wilder life to the Widow's ""sivilized"" ways, despite the beatings. He resolved to escape after Pap left him locked in for three days. He found a rusty wood-saw and began sawing a section of a log to create an escape hole. He hid his work when Pap returned. Pap, in a foul mood, ranted about his lawsuit for Huck's money and the government, expressing outrage over a free ""nigger"" who could vote. During a fit of delirium tremens, Pap chased Huck with a knife, calling him the ""Angel of Death."" Huck escaped by slipping out of his jacket.

The next morning, Huck, pretending to have been guarding against an intruder, was sent to check the fish lines. He found a drift-canoe and hid it, planning to use it for his escape. Pap left to sell a raft of logs, locking Huck in. Huck finished sawing his escape hole and gathered all his supplies. He then elaborately faked his own murder: he shot a wild pig, bled it on the cabin floor, smashed the door with an ax, dragged a sack of rocks to the river to simulate a body being dragged, bloodied the ax with his hair, and dumped the pig into the river. He then created a trail of corn meal to a shallow lake, dropping Pap's whetstone there, to suggest robbers had killed him and taken his belongings. He then drifted downriver in the hidden canoe.

Huck eventually saw Pap rowing a skiff downriver. He quickly paddled downstream, then out into the middle of the river to avoid the ferry landing. He heard people talking at the landing, then saw Jackson's Island. He landed the canoe in a hidden spot and went to sleep.

The next morning, Huck woke to the sound of a cannon, realizing the townspeople were firing it over the water to make his ""carcass"" float. He found a loaf of ""baker's bread"" (used to find drowned bodies) and ate it. He watched the ferryboat, carrying Pap, Judge Thatcher, Tom Sawyer, and others, searching for his body. After they left, Huck felt safe. He explored the island and found a still-smoking campfire. Frightened, he hid his belongings and climbed a tree. Later, he saw men approaching and fled in his canoe. He decided to find out who was on the island. He eventually found Jim, Miss Watson's ""nigger,"" asleep by a campfire.

Jim, initially thinking Huck was a ghost, was overjoyed to learn he was alive. Jim revealed he had run away after overhearing Miss Watson planning to sell him to New Orleans for $800. He had swum to the island after the wreck, hiding from search parties. He had been living on wild berries and receiving food from ""niggers"" who knew his hiding place. He also revealed that the raft was not destroyed in the steamboat collision but was found by ""niggers"" and hidden. Jim declared himself rich because he ""owns [him]sef,"" being worth $800.

Huck and Jim moved their belongings to a cavern on a ridge in the middle of the island. A severe storm hit, and they were safe and dry. They salvaged items from a floating frame-house, including clothes, tools, and a dead man shot in the back. Jim refused to discuss the dead man, fearing bad luck. They found eight dollars in silver sewn into a coat. Huck, recalling Jim's superstition about snake-skins, killed a rattlesnake and placed it on Jim's blanket as a prank. The snake's mate bit Jim, causing his foot and leg to swell. Jim was laid up for four days, pouring whiskey on the bite and drinking it. Huck felt guilty and vowed never to touch a snake-skin again.

After the river receded, they caught a huge catfish. Huck, bored, decided to go to town for news, disguised as a girl. He met Mrs. Judith Loftus, who was new to town. Huck, calling himself ""Sarah Williams,"" claimed to be a runaway apprentice heading to Goshen. Mrs. Loftus, however, saw through his disguise, revealing she knew he was a boy by his mannerisms (threading a needle, throwing a lead lump, catching it). She also informed him that the town believed Pap killed Huck, but then suspected Jim, who had run away the night of the ""murder."" She mentioned a reward for Jim and that her husband and another man planned to search Jackson's Island after midnight.

Huck, terrified, rushed back to Jim. They quickly loaded the raft and slipped away silently. They camouflaged the raft with branches and built a wigwam on it, with a dirt floor for a fire and a lantern for steamboats. They drifted downstream, passing St. Louis. Huck regularly slipped ashore to ""borrow"" food. Jim talked about earning money in free states to buy his family. Huck's conscience troubled him for helping a ""nigger"" escape, especially after Jim spoke of stealing his children. Huck decided to turn Jim in.

He took the canoe to investigate a light, believing it was Cairo. Jim, overjoyed, thanked Huck for his impending freedom. Huck, deeply moved by Jim's gratitude, hesitated. Two men in a skiff approached, looking for runaway ""niggers."" Huck, after a moment of internal struggle, lied and said the man on his raft was his Pap, sick with smallpox. The men, fearing contagion, gave Huck two twenty-dollar gold pieces and told him to float 20 miles downstream for help, but not to land near them. Huck, feeling he had done wrong but also glad he saved Jim, decided he would ""always do whichever come handiest at the time.""

They soon realized they had passed Cairo in the fog. The canoe was stolen. They continued downriver on the raft. During a storm, a steamboat crashed through their raft, and Huck and Jim dove overboard. Huck surfaced, called for Jim, and eventually found a plank to swim to shore. He landed near a large log house, where dogs barked at him.

Huck, calling himself ""George Jackson,"" claimed he fell off a steamboat. The family, the Grangerfords, were suspicious, thinking he might be a Shepherdson (a rival family in a long-standing feud). After confirming he wasn't, they welcomed him. Huck invented a new backstory about his family dying and him falling overboard. He learned about the Grangerford family, their house, and the deceased daughter, Emmeline, who wrote mournful poetry and drew pictures. He also learned about the ongoing, violent feud with the Shepherdsons, which had claimed many lives on both sides.

One Sunday, after a church sermon on brotherly love (attended by both armed families), Miss Sophia Grangerford asked Huck to retrieve her Testament from church. Inside, Huck found a note with ""Half past two"" written on it. He later discovered Jim hiding in a swamp near the Grangerford property, having been found and helped by the Grangerfords' ""niggers."" Jim explained the raft was recovered by the ""niggers"" and he had claimed it for them.

Huck learned that Miss Sophia had run off to marry young Harney Shepherdson. This ignited a fierce gun battle between the Grangerfords and Shepherdsons. Huck witnessed the brutal fighting from a tree, seeing Buck and his cousin Joe shot and killed. He felt responsible for the tragedy, believing he should have warned Miss Sophia's father about the note. He dragged Buck's and Joe's bodies ashore and covered their faces. He then found Jim, who had moved the raft. They quickly shoved off, glad to be away from the feuds.

Drifting south, they encountered the king and duke again, who were now broke from failed schemes. The duke dressed Jim as a ""Sick Arab"" (a drowned man painted blue) with a sign to deter visitors, allowing them to travel in daylight. The king and duke then learned about the death of Peter Wilks, a rich man, and the expected arrival of his English brothers, Harvey and William. They decided to impersonate the brothers.

Huck, disguised as ""Adolphus,"" the duke's servant, helped the king (as Harvey Wilks) and the duke (as the deaf and dumb William Wilks) gather information from a young man going to the steamboat. They learned about Peter's will, which left the house and $3,000 to his nieces (Mary Jane, Susan, and Joanna) and the tanyard, other property, and $3,000 to his brothers, with $6,000 in cash hidden in the cellar.

The king and duke arrived in town, performing a dramatic display of grief. They convinced the townspeople and the nieces of their identity. They found the $6,000 in the cellar, but it was $415 short. The king and duke secretly made up the deficit from their own money. They then publicly gave the entire $6,000 to the nieces, further solidifying their deception. Dr. Robinson, a local doctor, recognized the king's fake English accent and denounced them as frauds, but Mary Jane, Peter's eldest niece, bravely defended them, returning the money to the king and duke.

Huck, feeling terrible about letting the frauds rob the good girls, resolved to steal the money back. He hid behind a curtain and overheard the king and duke discussing their plans. The duke wanted to leave with the money, but the king wanted to stay and sell the rest of the property, arguing the buyers would be the real victims, not the orphans. The king then hid the money in a straw tick under his feather-bed. Huck retrieved it and hid it in his cubby.

Later, Huck, unable to sleep, decided to hide the money in the coffin. He crept downstairs, found the watchers asleep, and slipped the money bag under the coffin lid, just beyond the dead man's crossed hands. Mary Jane then entered, knelt by the coffin, and cried silently. Huck slipped away. He worried the money would be found when the coffin was screwed shut.

The next day, the funeral was held. During the sermon, a dog howled in the cellar. The undertaker silently went to the cellar, and a whack and a howl were heard, after which he whispered to the preacher, ""_He had a rat!_"" The undertaker then screwed down the coffin lid, leaving Huck unsure if the money was still inside.

The king announced he and ""William"" would soon return to England and take the girls with them. He put all the property, including the ""niggers,"" up for auction. The next day, the king sold Jim's family (the mother to New Orleans, the sons to Memphis) for three-day drafts, causing immense grief to the girls and the ""niggers."" Huck was sickened but knew the sale was invalid and they would return.

The king and duke, realizing the $6,000 was gone, questioned Huck. Huck, feigning innocence, blamed the ""niggers,"" claiming he saw them sneaking out of the room. The king and duke, believing him, regretted selling the ""niggers.""

Huck found Mary Jane crying over the separation of the ""niggers."" He blurted out that they would see each other again in two weeks. He then confessed the king and duke were frauds. Mary Jane was furious and wanted to expose them. Huck, to protect Jim, convinced her to go to a friend's house out of town and stay there until he could arrange things. He gave her a note revealing the money was in the coffin and told her to send for witnesses from ""Bricksville"" if the frauds were questioned. He also told her to leave before breakfast so her face wouldn't betray their secret.

At the auction, a steamboat arrived, bringing the real Harvey Wilks (the old gentleman) and William Wilks (the younger man with a broken arm). The king and duke maintained their act, but Dr. Robinson and Levi Bell (the lawyer) were suspicious. Hines, a local man, exposed the king's lie about his arrival by canoe. Dr. Robinson declared the king and duke frauds and insisted on an investigation.

The king claimed the money was stolen by the ""niggers"" from his straw tick. Huck corroborated the story. The lawyer then asked the king and duke to write their names. Their writing was illegible. The real Harvey Wilks explained his brother William copied for him, and his own writing was unreadable. The lawyer determined the king and duke were not Wilkses. Harvey then asked what was tattooed on Peter's breast. The king, after hesitation, claimed it was a blue arrow. Ab Turner and his pard, who laid out Peter, denied seeing any marks. Harvey then revealed it was ""P—B—W,"" but the men still denied seeing any marks.

The crowd, enraged, demanded the frauds be lynched. The lawyer intervened, suggesting they dig up the corpse to check for the tattoo marks. The crowd agreed, and they all marched to the graveyard. As they dug in the dark, a lightning flash revealed the bag of gold on Peter Wilks's breast. Hines dropped Huck's wrist in the excitement, and Huck seized the chance to run.

Huck fled to his raft, where he found Jim. He declared Jim free. Jim praised the escape plan. Tom then revealed he had been shot in the calf of his leg during the escape. Jim, insisting on a doctor, refused to move. Huck went for the doctor, lying that Tom accidentally shot himself while hunting. The doctor, suspicious, took Huck's canoe. Huck, worried, decided to tie up the doctor if he took too long.

Huck later ran into Uncle Silas, who mistook him for Tom. Huck invented more lies about hunting the ""nigger"" with ""Sid."" At the Phelps's house, Aunt Sally (Silas's wife) mistook Huck for Tom and was overjoyed. She then became frantic about ""Sid"" (the real Tom) not returning. Huck offered to get him.

Aunt Sally then discovered the butter melting in Huck's hat, thinking his brains were oozing out. She sent him to bed. Huck rushed to Tom, telling him the house was full of armed men. Tom, excited, refused to abandon his elaborate escape plan. The men approached the cabin. Huck, Jim, and Tom escaped through the hole, with Tom's britches catching on the fence, making a noise. Shots were fired. Their own dogs, recognizing them, ignored them and ran towards the shouting. Huck, Jim, and Tom paddled to the raft.

Huck again declared Jim free. Tom, despite his injury, urged them to continue their ""evasion."" Jim, however, insisted on getting a doctor for Tom, saying he wouldn't budge otherwise. Huck agreed, recognizing Jim's ""white inside."" Tom gave Huck elaborate instructions for bringing the doctor, including blindfolding him and taking his chalk.

Huck fetched the doctor, lying about Tom's hunting accident. The doctor, suspicious, took Huck's canoe. Huck returned to the Phelps's house, where Aunt Sally was still worried about ""Sid."" At dinner, the farmers discussed the ""crazy nigger"" Jim and the elaborate escape, concluding it must have been ""sperits"" because the dogs never tracked them. Aunt Sally revealed she had locked her ""boys"" in their room the night before. Huck, realizing she was wondering how they got out, invented a story about going down the lightning-rod.

The next morning, Aunt Sally received a letter from Aunt Polly. Before she could read it, she saw Tom Sawyer on a mattress, with the doctor and Jim (in a calico dress, tied), surrounded by people. Aunt Sally, thinking Tom was dead, then realized he was alive. The men wanted to hang Jim, but the doctor intervened, praising Jim for helping him nurse Tom, risking his freedom. The men agreed Jim deserved kind treatment.

Tom, waking up, revealed that he and Huck had set Jim free. Aunt Sally was furious, but Tom then announced that Miss Watson had died two months ago and freed Jim in her will. Aunt Sally was shocked, asking why he went to such trouble for an already free ""nigger."" Tom said he wanted the ""adventure."" Just then, Aunt Polly arrived, confirming Jim's freedom and revealing Huck's true identity and Tom's elaborate deception. Aunt Polly also revealed she had written to Aunt Sally twice about ""Sid"" (Huck) being there, but Tom had hidden the letters.

In the final chapter, Huck learned Tom's original plan was to free Jim, have adventures downriver, then reveal his freedom, take him back in style, and make him a hero. Huck thought the actual outcome was just as well. Jim was freed from his chains and treated well by the Phelps family for helping the doctor. Tom gave Jim forty dollars for being a patient prisoner. Jim, overjoyed, declared his hairy breast prophecy of wealth had come true. Tom then suggested they go for ""howling adventures amongst the Injuns"" in the territory. Huck worried he had no money because Pap had likely taken it. Tom revealed Pap hadn't been back, and Huck's $6,000 was safe. Jim then solemnly revealed that the dead man in the floating house was Pap.

Huck concludes the narrative by stating he must ""light out for the territory ahead of the rest,"" because Aunt Sally is going to adopt him and ""sivilize"" him, and he ""can’t stand it."""
The Count of Monte Cristo-Alexandre Dumas,"On February 24, 1815, the three-masted ship *Pharaon* arrived in Marseilles. Edmond Dantès, the young and resolute first mate, reported to the owner, M. Morrel, that Captain Leclere had died during the voyage. Dantès, who was highly regarded by the crew, was praised for his skillful handling of the ship and was promised the captaincy by Morrel, pending his partner's approval.

Danglars, the envious supercargo, subtly attempted to undermine Dantès by suggesting he had lost time at the Island of Elba. When questioned by Morrel, Dantès explained he had stopped at Elba to deliver a packet for the deceased captain to Marshal Bertrand, and had even briefly met Napoleon himself. Morrel, though delighted by Napoleon's remembrance of his uncle, warned Dantès of potential trouble. Danglars then falsely insinuated that Dantès had also received a *letter* from Captain Leclere, which he had not delivered to Morrel.

Dantès, overjoyed by the prospect of becoming captain, planned to marry his beloved fiancée, Mercédès, a beautiful Catalan woman, and then travel to Paris to deliver Captain Leclere's final commission. He first visited his elderly father, only to discover that his father had been living in poverty, having used the money Edmond left him to pay off a debt to their neighbor, Caderousse. Edmond, heartbroken, gave his father all his money.

Meanwhile, Mercédès was being pressured by her cousin, Fernand Mondego, who was deeply in love with her. She repeatedly rejected his advances, affirming her unwavering love for Edmond and threatening to kill herself if any harm befell him. Fernand, consumed by jealousy, encountered Danglars and Caderousse at a tavern. Danglars, seizing the opportunity to eliminate a rival for the captaincy, cunningly drafted an anonymous denunciation letter, accusing Dantès of being a Bonapartist agent carrying secret correspondence. He wrote it with his left hand to disguise his writing and then pretended to discard it. Fernand, unseen, retrieved the letter.

At Dantès' joyous wedding feast at La Réserve, attended by M. Morrel, Danglars, Caderousse, and Fernand, Edmond announced his imminent civil marriage. Fernand, pale and agitated, was seated next to Mercédès. As the celebration was underway, a magistrate arrived with soldiers and arrested Edmond Dantès on charges of being a Bonapartist agent.

Dantès was taken before M. de Villefort, the deputy procureur du roi. Villefort, a young, ambitious royalist, was engaged to Renée, the daughter of the Marquis de Saint-Méran. During the interrogation, Dantès explained his stop at Elba was to fulfill his captain's dying wish to deliver a packet to Marshal Bertrand, and that he received a letter in return addressed to a ""M. Noirtier"" in Paris, whose contents he claimed ignorance of. Villefort, initially inclined to believe Dantès' innocence, was horrified when he realized ""M. Noirtier"" was his own father, a prominent Bonapartist. To protect his career and avoid being implicated in his father's political activities, Villefort burned the letter and, despite his promise of leniency, ordered Dantès imprisoned. He instructed Dantès to deny all knowledge of the letter.

Dantès was taken to the infamous Château d’If, a prison for political prisoners. He attempted to escape by jumping into the sea but was restrained and threatened. He was thrown into a dark, reeking dungeon, where he slowly succumbed to despair. He lost track of time and contemplated suicide by starvation.

After some time, Dantès heard a scratching sound in the wall. It was another prisoner, the Abbé Faria, who had been imprisoned since 1811. Faria, a learned Italian priest, had spent years digging an escape tunnel but had miscalculated, ending up in the corridor outside Dantès' cell. Faria, though considered mad by the jailers for his talk of immense treasure, was a brilliant and resourceful man. He taught Dantès history, languages, mathematics, and philosophy, transforming him into an educated and refined individual.

Faria helped Dantès deduce the true nature of his arrest: Danglars, Fernand, and Villefort had conspired against him. He revealed that ""M. Noirtier"" was Villefort's father, and that Villefort had sacrificed Dantès to protect his own reputation. Faria also revealed the secret of the Spada family treasure, hidden on the island of Monte Cristo, which amounted to millions of francs. He made Dantès his heir.

Faria suffered a third, fatal attack of catalepsy. Before dying, he instructed Dantès on how to take his place in the winding sheet and escape from the prison, which had no cemetery and simply threw bodies into the sea. Dantès, filled with a new resolve for vengeance, swapped places with Faria's corpse. He was thrown into the sea with a cannonball tied to his feet. Using a knife Faria had made, he cut himself free and swam to the uninhabited island of Tiboulen.

Disguising himself as a shipwrecked sailor, Dantès was rescued by a Genoese smuggling ship, *La Jeune Amélie*. He learned it was 1829, fourteen years since his imprisonment. He renewed his oath of vengeance. He sailed with the smugglers, learning their trade. At Leghorn, he transformed his appearance, cutting his long hair and beard, becoming unrecognizable. He then bought a yacht and returned to Monte Cristo, where he found the Spada treasure.

Now immensely wealthy, Edmond Dantès, under the new identity of the Count of Monte Cristo, began to execute his vengeance. He first visited Marseilles, where he learned his father had died of starvation and Mercédès had disappeared. He anonymously provided money to the Morrel family, who were on the brink of bankruptcy, saving them from ruin. He then set in motion events that would expose his enemies.

He visited Caderousse, disguised as the Abbé Busoni, and extracted the full confession of the conspiracy against him, including Danglars' letter and Fernand's involvement. He gave Caderousse a diamond from the Spada treasure, but Caderousse, consumed by greed, murdered a jeweller for it. Caderousse was later arrested.

Monte Cristo then orchestrated Danglars' financial ruin through manipulated telegraph messages and stock market speculation. He also arranged for Danglars to be kidnapped by the Roman bandit Luigi Vampa, whom Monte Cristo had previously saved from execution. Vampa systematically extorted Danglars' remaining fortune, leaving him penniless and with his hair turned white from terror.

Monte Cristo also targeted Villefort. He bought the house in Auteuil where Villefort had buried his illegitimate child (Benedetto) alive. Through his steward, Bertuccio (who had stabbed Villefort that night and rescued the child), Monte Cristo revealed the secret of the buried infant, causing immense distress to Villefort and his wife, Héloïse. Héloïse, who had been poisoning members of her own family (the Saint-Mérans and Barrois) to secure Valentine's inheritance for her son Edward, was exposed by Monte Cristo's subtle manipulations and the doctor's (d'Avrigny's) investigations. Valentine, who was also being poisoned by her stepmother, was saved by Noirtier's foresight in gradually accustoming her to brucine. At Benedetto's trial, Benedetto publicly revealed Villefort as his father and the details of his live burial, driving Villefort to madness. Villefort returned home to find his wife, Héloïse, had poisoned herself and their son, Edward. In a fit of madness, Villefort began digging in the garden for his buried child.

Albert de Morcerf, Fernand's son, learned of his father's treason in Yanina through articles published by Beauchamp, instigated by Danglars and Monte Cristo. Albert, devastated by his father's dishonor, challenged Monte Cristo to a duel. Mercédès, recognizing Monte Cristo as Edmond Dantès, pleaded with him to spare her son. Monte Cristo, moved by her anguish, agreed to sacrifice himself. However, at the duel, Albert, having learned the full extent of his father's treachery from his mother, publicly apologized to Monte Cristo, acknowledging his right to vengeance. Albert then renounced his father's name and fortune, and enlisted in the army, leaving his mother to live in humble retirement in Marseilles, supported by the money Edmond had buried for her years ago.

Finally, Monte Cristo brought Maximilian Morrel, who was in despair over Valentine's supposed death, to the island of Monte Cristo. There, he revealed that Valentine was alive, having been saved by his intervention. He reunited the lovers and bequeathed his immense fortune to Maximilian, on condition that he marry Haydée, Ali Pasha's daughter, whom Monte Cristo had adopted. Monte Cristo, having completed his vengeance and atonement, departed with Haydée, leaving a letter for Maximilian and Valentine, urging them to ""Wait and hope."""
The Decameron-Giovanni Boccaccio,"Here is a very detailed plot summary of the provided text, strictly adhering to the content and avoiding any external knowledge, analysis, or historical context.

**PROEM**

The author begins by stating his compassionate nature towards the afflicted, particularly those who have experienced suffering and found comfort. He recounts his own youth, inflamed by a ""high and noble passion"" that caused him great travail due to an ""ill-ordered appetite"" and lack of reasonable bounds. He found solace and refreshment in the ""pleasant discourse of a certain friend."" This passion eventually abated, leaving him only a ""pleasance."" Out of gratitude for the comfort he received, and to avoid appearing ungrateful, he now wishes to offer relief to those in need, especially lovesick ladies. He argues that women, being more delicate, fearful, and constrained by societal expectations, suffer more intensely from melancholy bred of ardent desire, as they lack the diversions available to men (hunting, gaming, trafficking). Therefore, to amend Fortune's ""unright,"" he purposes to recount one hundred stories, or fables, or histories, over ten days, told by an ""honourable company of seven ladies and three young men,"" who formed during the ""late deadly pestilence."" These stories will contain ""love-chances, both gladsome and grievous,"" and other ""accidents of fortune,"" offering both solace and useful counsel to the ladies who read them, helping them learn what to avoid and what to pursue.

**Day the First**

**Introduction**
The author addresses the ladies, acknowledging that the beginning of his work will be grievous due to the ""dolorous remembrance of the late pestiferous mortality"" (the plague of 1348 in Florence). He compares this grim start to a rugged mountain that leads to a delightful plain, promising pleasure after a brief account of misery.

The plague arrived in Florence in 1348, spreading from the East. No human wisdom, foresight (such as purging the city, forbidding entry to the sick, or health counsels), or humble supplications to God could stop it. The malady first appeared as swellings (plague-boils) in the groin or armpits, then black or livid blotches on the body. Neither physicians nor medicine availed; most victims died within three days, often without fever. The contagion spread rapidly through contact with the sick or their belongings. Even animals touching infected rags died quickly.

These horrors led to various, often barbarous, reactions. Some isolated themselves in clean houses, living temperately with music and diversions, avoiding all news of the sick. Others adopted a contrary philosophy, carousing, singing, and satisfying every appetite, believing it a remedy, and using abandoned houses as common property, while still shunning the sick. A middle group used aromatic herbs to fortify themselves against the stench of death. Some fled the city entirely, believing God's wrath would only affect those within the walls.

The plague dissolved all law and order, as ministers were dead or sick. Family bonds broke down: brother forsook brother, parents abandoned their children. The sick were left to the charity of few friends or the greed of ill-qualified servants, many of whom also perished. This led to a new custom where women, regardless of status, were tended by men, exposing their bodies without shame, which might have led to less modesty in survivors. The sheer number of daily deaths overwhelmed traditional burial customs. Bodies were often taken to the nearest church by a few hired ""pickmen"" (gravediggers) and buried in mass trenches. The countryside was equally afflicted, with peasants dying like beasts, and livestock wandering untended as people abandoned their fields and consumed existing provisions, expecting imminent death. The author estimates over 100,000 deaths in Florence between March and July, leaving many noble houses empty and families without heirs.

Weary of these miseries, the author shifts to the story of seven young ladies, aged eighteen to twenty-eight, all discreet, noble, fair, and sprightly, who met by chance on a Tuesday morning in the venerable church of Santa Maria Novella. Their names are Pampinea, Fiammetta, Filomena, Emilia, Lauretta, Neifile, and Elisa. Pampinea, the eldest, proposes they leave the afflicted city for their country estates to live joyously and honorably. Filomena, being discreet, agrees but suggests they need men for guidance, as women alone are ""fickle, wilful, suspicious, faint-hearted and timorous."" Elisa concurs, noting that most of their kinsmen have fled.

At that moment, three young men enter the church: Pamfilo, Filostrato, and Dioneo, all agreeable and well-bred, seeking their mistresses (three of the seven ladies) or kinswomen. Pampinea suggests they invite these men to join their company as guides and servants. Neifile expresses concern about scandal due to the men's love for some of the ladies, but Filomena dismisses this, stating that if they live honestly, God and truth will defend them. The other ladies agree. Pampinea, related to one of the men, invites them to join in a ""pure and brotherly spirit."" The young men, initially thinking it a jest, joyfully accept and prepare for departure.

The next morning (Wednesday), the company, with their servants, leaves Florence and travels two miles to a beautiful palace on a hill. The place is well-appointed with pleasant rooms, gardens, cold water wells, and fine wines, all swept and adorned with flowers. Dioneo, the merriest, suggests they live merrily and appoint a leader. Pampinea proposes a daily election of a chief (alternating sexes) to order their activities. The company elects Pampinea as the first queen. Filomena crowns her with a laurel wreath. Pampinea then appoints Parmeno as seneschal, Sirisco as purveyor/treasurer, Tindaro for the gentlemen's chambers, Misia and Licisca for the kitchen, and Chimera and Stratilia for the ladies' chambers and cleanliness. She commands them to bring only joyous news from outside.

Pampinea dismisses the company to enjoy the gardens. At tierce (9 a.m.), they return for a joyful dinner, served diligently by Parmeno. After dinner, they dance to lute and viol music played by Dioneo and Fiammetta, and sing songs. At the queen's signal, they retire for a siesta. After none (3 p.m.), Pampinea gathers them in a cool meadow and proposes storytelling to pass the hottest part of the day, allowing each to tell a story on any subject they choose. Pamfilo, seated to her right, is asked to begin.

**Story 1: Master Ciappelletto (Pamfilo)**
Pamfilo begins by praising God and emphasizing that even when humans mistakenly pray to a reprobate, God, seeing the purity of intent, may still grant their petitions. He tells of Musciatto Franzesi, a Florentine merchant in France, who needed someone wicked enough to recover debts from litigious Burgundians. He chose Master Ciapperello da Prato, nicknamed Ciappelletto by the French. Ciappelletto was an utterly depraved man: a fraudulent notary, a perjurer, a stirrer of discord, a murderer, a blasphemer, a frequenter of lewd places, a sodomite, a thief, a glutton, and a gambler. Musciatto had often protected him from the law.

Ciappelletto, now unemployed, accepted Musciatto's offer and went to Burgundy. While lodging with two Florentine usurer brothers, he fell mortally ill. The brothers were distraught, fearing that if Ciappelletto died unconfessed (due to his wickedness) or unabsolved (due to his numerous sins), his body would be cast into a ditch, bringing scandal upon them and potentially leading to their plunder by the townspeople, who already disliked their trade. Ciappelletto, overhearing their fears, promised to resolve the situation. He asked them to bring the holiest and most worthy friar they could find.

A venerable, learned, and highly respected friar was brought. Ciappelletto, feigning deep piety, told the friar he confessed weekly but had missed eight days due to illness. He insisted on a general confession from birth. He then proceeded to confess a series of invented, minor sins with exaggerated remorse: claiming to be a virgin (ashamed of his ""vainglory""), admitting to gluttony only for enjoying water too much after fasting and desiring simple potherbs, confessing avarice only to say he gave most of his inherited wealth to charity and shared his mercantile gains with the poor, and admitting to anger only at others' sins and lack of fear of God. He even confessed to once cursing his mother (a sin he wept over profusely) and spitting in a church. The friar, believing him to be a saint, absolved him and asked if he wished to be buried in his convent. Ciappelletto agreed, requesting the Eucharist and extreme unction.

The two brothers, hidden behind a wainscot, overheard the confession and were amazed by Ciappelletto's audacious lies, but relieved that he secured a church burial. Ciappelletto received the sacraments and died shortly after. The friar, convinced of Ciappelletto's sanctity, announced his holy death to his brethren, persuading them to give him a reverent burial. The next morning, Ciappelletto's body was borne to the church with great pomp, followed by most of the town. The friar preached a sermon extolling Ciappelletto's virginity, fasts, innocence, and sanctity, recounting his ""greatest sin"" (cursing his mother) as proof of his pure conscience. The townspeople, fully believing, flocked to kiss his body and tore pieces of his clothing as relics. He was honorably buried in a marble tomb and became known as Saint Ciappelletto, with many miracles attributed to him. Pamfilo concludes that God, looking at the purity of the suppliant's intent rather than the reprobate nature of the intercessor, hears prayers.

**Story 2: Abraham the Jew (Neifile)**
Neifile tells of Jehannot de Chevigné, a loyal Parisian merchant, and his rich Jewish friend, Abraham. Jehannot, concerned for Abraham's soul, repeatedly urged him to convert to Christianity, arguing its prosperity contrasted with the decline of Judaism. Abraham, a master of his own law, was swayed by Jehannot's arguments but insisted on first visiting Rome to observe the Pope, cardinals, and clergy. Jehannot was dismayed, certain that the depravity of the Roman court would deter Abraham from conversion.

Abraham traveled to Rome, where he observed the clergy, from highest to lowest, to be shamefully lustful (including Sodomitical practices), gluttonous, and greedy, selling sacred things and church benefices for money. He saw simony disguised as ""procuration"" and gluttony as ""sustentation."" Disgusted, he returned to Paris. Jehannot, expecting Abraham to be more entrenched in Judaism, was surprised when Abraham declared his intention to convert. Abraham explained that if the Christian religion, despite being led by such corrupt men who actively sought its destruction, continued to grow and flourish, it must be founded and supported by the Holy Spirit, proving its truth and holiness. Jehannot, overjoyed, had Abraham baptized and named Giovanni. Abraham became a devout Christian.

**Story 3: Melchizedek the Jew (Filomena)**
Filomena tells of Saladin, Sultan of Babylon, who, having exhausted his treasury in wars and munificence, needed a large sum of money. He thought of the rich but miserly Jewish usurer, Melchizedek of Alexandria. Unwilling to use force, Saladin devised a trap. He summoned Melchizedek and, feigning interest in theological matters, asked which of the three laws (Jewish, Saracen, or Christian) was the true one. Melchizedek, a wise man, realized Saladin sought to entrap him and could not praise one without offending the others.

He responded with a story: A rich man owned a precious ring, which he decreed would designate his heir. This custom continued for generations. Eventually, a father with three equally beloved and virtuous sons, having promised the ring to each, secretly commissioned two identical copies. On his deathbed, he gave each son a ring. After his death, each son claimed to be the heir, but the rings were indistinguishable, leaving the question of the true heir unresolved. Melchizedek concluded, ""And so say I to you, my lord, of the three Laws to the three peoples given of God the Father... each people deemeth itself to have his inheritance, His true Law and His commandments; but of which in very deed hath them, even as of the rings, the question yet pendeth.""

Saladin, seeing his trap foiled, revealed his true need. Melchizedek freely provided the money, and Saladin repaid him fully, gave him gifts, and kept him as a friend and advisor.

**Story 4: A Monk (Dioneo)**
Dioneo tells of a young, lusty monk in a monastery in Lunigiana. One day, while the other monks slept, he saw a beautiful peasant girl gathering herbs. Overcome by desire, he seduced her and brought her to his cell. The abbot, awakening, heard their noise, stealthily approached the cell, and realized a woman was inside. He decided to wait for the monk to emerge. The monk, however, noticed the abbot watching and, realizing his predicament, devised a plan. He locked the girl in his cell, went to the abbot's chamber, and, presenting the key (as was customary when leaving the monastery), requested permission to go to the woods to fetch faggots.

The abbot, eager to catch the monk, granted permission and took the key. Once the monk was gone, the abbot debated whether to expose the monk publicly or investigate privately. Fearing the girl might be of noble birth, he decided to see her first. He opened the cell door, entered, and locked it behind him. Seeing the young, beautiful girl, the abbot, despite his age, was overcome by lust. He comforted her, then revealed his desire. The girl, not made of ""iron nor adamant,"" readily complied. The abbot, mindful of his dignity, lay with her on the monk's pallet, placing her on his own breast.

The monk, who had only feigned going to the woods and was hiding in the dormitory, observed the abbot entering his cell alone and locking the door. He then watched through a crevice as the abbot lay with the girl. When the abbot finished, he locked the girl in the cell and returned to his room, planning to punish the monk severely to keep the girl for himself. He summoned the monk and rebuked him harshly, ordering him imprisoned. The monk calmly replied that he was new to the order and hadn't learned that monks used women for mortification, but now that the abbot had shown him, he would follow his example. The abbot, realizing the monk had seen everything, was shamed. He pardoned the monk, charged him to keep silent, and they discreetly released the girl. It is believed she returned to the monastery more than once.

**Story 5: The Marchioness of Monferrato (Fiammetta)**
Fiammetta tells of the Marquis of Monferrato, a valiant crusader. King Philippe le Borgne of France, hearing of the Marquis's beautiful and noble wife, fell in love with her sight unseen. He decided to travel to Genoa for the crusade via land, planning to visit the Marchioness in her husband's absence and fulfill his desire. The Marchioness, discreet and wise, understood his true intention. She welcomed him, but for dinner, she instructed her cooks to prepare only dishes made from hens, despite the region's abundance of game.

At dinner, the King was pleased but, noticing only hens, asked the Marchioness, ""Madam, are hens only born in these parts, without ever a cock?"" The Marchioness, understanding his veiled meaning, boldly replied, ""Nay, my lord; but women, albeit in apparel and dignities they may differ somewhat from others, are natheless all of the same fashion here as elsewhere."" The King immediately understood her meaning: that women, regardless of status, are all the same in their capacity for love, implying she was not easily swayed. Ashamed, he abandoned his ill-conceived passion, finished his meal, thanked her, and departed for Genoa, regretting his unseemly visit.

**Story 6: An Honest Man and the Inquisitor (Emilia)**
Emilia tells of a Minor Friar in Florence, an inquisitor of heresy, who was more interested in wealthy individuals than in matters of faith. He found a rich but simple man who, in jest, said he had wine so good ""that Christ himself might drink thereof."" The inquisitor, seeing an opportunity for gain, accused the man of heresy. The man confessed, explaining it was a jest. The inquisitor, feigning outrage, threatened him with burning, calling him an Epicurean. The terrified man, through intermediaries, paid the inquisitor a large sum of money (""St. John Goldenmouth's ointment""). This ""ointment"" (money) caused the inquisitor to commute the sentence to wearing a yellow cross on black cloth as penance.

The inquisitor kept the man for several days, ordering him to attend mass daily at Santa Croce and report to him at dinner. One morning, the man heard the Gospel verse, ""For every one ye shall receive an hundred."" At dinner, the inquisitor asked if he had heard anything doubtful. The man replied he had heard something that made him pity the friars. When asked why, he explained that since he saw the friars daily give away ""superfluous"" cauldrons of broth to the poor, if they received a hundredfold for each in the afterlife, they would surely drown in it. All at the table laughed, but the inquisitor, realizing the jab at his gluttonous hypocrisy, was enraged. Fearing further prosecution, he dismissed the man, telling him to do as he pleased and not return.

**Story 7: Bergamino and Messer Cane della Scala (Filostrato)**
Filostrato tells of Messer Cane della Scala, a magnificent nobleman in Verona. He planned a grand entertainment but suddenly cancelled it, dismissing all guests except Bergamino, a witty and accomplished entertainer. Messer Cane, for unknown reasons, decided not to reward Bergamino, nor even dismiss him. Bergamino, running out of money while waiting, had to pawn his fine clothes. One day, while eating his last meal (from his third suit of clothes), he appeared before Messer Cane with a rueful face. Messer Cane, to tease him, asked what troubled him.

Bergamino, without hesitation, told a story: Primasso, a learned and famous grammarian, was poor in Paris. Hearing of the Abbot of Cluny's immense wealth and open hospitality, he decided to visit. Fearing he might get lost and find no food, he brought three cakes of bread. He arrived at the abbey, saw the grand preparations, and was seated at a table. It was customary for no food or drink to be served until the Abbot was seated. The Abbot, entering, saw Primasso, poorly dressed, and a sudden thought of avarice struck him. He returned to his chamber, asking if anyone knew the ""losel."" No one did. Primasso, hungry, ate his first cake. The Abbot, informed, said Primasso could eat his own food but not the abbey's. Primasso ate his second cake, and then his third. The Abbot, seeing this, reflected on his uncharacteristic avarice towards this man, realizing it must mean the man was significant. He discovered it was Primasso, whom he knew by reputation. Ashamed, the Abbot honored Primasso with sumptuous clothes, money, and a palfrey, giving him the choice to stay or leave. Primasso, well-pleased, returned to Paris on horseback, having arrived on foot.

Messer Cane, understanding Bergamino's subtle rebuke, laughed. He admitted that avarice had only assailed him on Bergamino's account. He paid Bergamino's host, gave Bergamino fine clothes, money, and a palfrey, and allowed him to choose whether to stay or go.

**Story 8: Guglielmo Borsiere and Messer Ermino de' Grimaldi (Lauretta)**
Lauretta tells of Messer Ermino de' Grimaldi, a Genoese gentleman of immense wealth but extreme avarice, who was known as ""Messer Ermino Avarizia."" Guglielmo Borsiere, a worthy and well-spoken minstrel (not like the corrupt ones of the present day, the author interjects), came to Genoa. Hearing of Ermino's miserliness, he wished to see him. Ermino, having heard of Borsiere's worth, received him amicably and showed him his fine new house. Ermino then asked Borsiere if he could suggest something never before seen to be depicted in his saloon. Borsiere replied that he could not suggest something *never* seen, but he could suggest something Ermino himself had *never* seen: ""Cause Liberality to be here depictured.""

Ermino was so shamed by this witty rebuke that his disposition changed entirely. He promised to depict Liberality in such a way that no one would ever say he hadn't seen or known it. From that day, he became the most liberal and courteous gentleman in Genoa.

**Story 9: The King of Cyprus (Elisa)**
Elisa tells of the first King of Cyprus, a mean-spirited and pusillanimous ruler who tolerated countless affronts. A Gascon gentlewoman, returning from a pilgrimage to the Holy Sepulchre, was shamefully abused in Cyprus. Unable to get redress from the king, she decided to rebuke his pusillanimity. She presented herself to him in tears, not seeking justice for herself, but asking him to teach her how he endured the affronts offered to him, so she might learn to bear her own. She added that she would gladly bestow her suffering on him, since he was ""so excellent a supporter thereof.""

The King, awakened as if from sleep, was moved by her words. He cruelly avenged the wrong done to the lady and from that day forward became a rigorous prosecutor of all who offended his crown's honor.

**Story 10: Master Alberto of Bologna (Pampinea)**
Pampinea tells of Master Alberto, a famous physician in Bologna, nearly seventy years old, who fell passionately in love with a beautiful widow, Madam Malgherida de' Ghisolieri. He constantly passed by her house, which amused her and her friends, who mocked an old man being in love. One holiday, the ladies invited him into a courtyard and civilly asked him why he, an old man, loved a lady courted by many young men.

Master Alberto, with a cheerful countenance, replied that love was no marvel, especially for her, who deserved it. He explained that while old men lack the vigor for ""amorous exercises,"" they retain the will and wit to appreciate what is worthy of love, perhaps even more than the young. As for his hope, he compared it to ladies who eat leeks: they hold the head (the good part) in their hand but munch the leaves (the bad part). He suggested that perhaps they did the same in choosing lovers, implying he, the ""head,"" might be chosen over the ""leaves"" (young men). The lady and her companions were abashed but commended his wit. The lady then graciously told him that his love was dear to her and he could command her, saving her honor. Master Alberto thanked her and departed, having turned their mockery back on them.

**Conclusion of Day the First**
As the sun began to decline, the storytelling ended. Pampinea, declaring her governance concluded, placed the laurel wreath on Filomena's head, naming her the new queen. Filomena, blushing, confirmed all the offices and set the theme for the next day: ""OF THOSE WHO AFTER BEING BAFFLED BY DIVERS CHANCES HAVE WON AT LAST TO A JOYFUL ISSUE BEYOND THEIR HOPE."" Dioneo, alone, requested the privilege of telling any story he liked, regardless of the theme, and promised to speak last. The queen granted this, believing he would cheer the company. They then went to a clear stream, bathed, returned to the palace for supper, and danced. Emilia sang a song about self-love and finding contentment within, which caused some thought among the listeners. The queen then dismissed them to rest.

**Day the Second**

**Introduction**
The next morning, a Sunday, the company arose with the dawn, enjoying the gardens and birdsong. After breakfast and dancing, they rested. After none, they reassembled by the fountain. Filomena, crowned with laurel, bade Neifile begin the day's stories.

**Story 1: Martellino (Neifile)**
Neifile tells of three Florentine entertainers, Stecchi, Martellino, and Marchese, who arrived in Treviso during a commotion. A poor German, Arrigo, had died, and the church bells had rung miraculously, leading the townspeople to declare him a saint. His body was brought to the Cathedral, where people brought the sick for healing. Martellino, eager to see the spectacle, devised a plan: he would feign to be a cripple, and his friends would carry him to the saint for a ""miraculous"" cure.

Martellino contorted his body and face to appear palsied. Marchese and Stecchi carried him to the church, humbly asking people to make way. They reached Arrigo's body, and Martellino was laid upon it. After a moment, he began to ""recover,"" first a finger, then a hand, then an arm, until he stretched out completely. The crowd erupted in praise of Saint Arrigo. A Florentine who knew Martellino, but hadn't recognized him in his crippled state, now saw him cured and exclaimed, ""God confound him! Who that saw him come had not deemed him palsied in good earnest?"" Trevisans overheard, realized the deception, and furiously attacked Martellino, beating him severely.

Stecchi and Marchese, fearing for their lives, cried out with the crowd but quickly devised a plan to save Martellino. Marchese ran to the Provost's officer, claiming Martellino had cut his purse for a hundred gold florins. Sergeants rescued Martellino from the mob, bringing him to the palace. Other townspeople, seeing an opportunity, also accused him of cutpursery. The crabbed judge, incensed by Martellino's jesting replies, had him tortured on the strappado to confess. Martellino, realizing denial was useless, offered to confess if his accusers specified when and where he robbed them. They gave conflicting dates, some even claiming that very day, which Martellino pointed out was impossible as he had only just arrived in Treviso.

Marchese and Stecchi, realizing their plan had backfired, sought help from Sandro Agolanti, a Florentine with influence with the Prince. Sandro, after much laughter, persuaded the Prince to send for Martellino. Martellino, terrified before the judge, recounted his entire story to the Prince. The Prince laughed heartily, gave each of the three men new clothes, and allowed them to return home safely, having escaped a great peril.

**Story 2: Rinaldo d'Asti (Filostrato)**
Filostrato tells of Rinaldo d'Asti, a merchant returning from Bologna. Near Ferrara, he joined three men he thought were merchants but were actually highwaymen. Rinaldo, a simple man, told them he always said a Pater and Ave for St. Julian's parents each morning to ensure good lodging. The highwaymen, knowing their plan, scoffed. Later, near Castel Guglielmo, they robbed Rinaldo of his money, clothes, and horse, leaving him in his shirt and barefoot in the snow, telling him to see if St. Julian would help him now. His servant fled to Castel Guglielmo.

Rinaldo, freezing and distraught, ran towards Castel Guglielmo but arrived after the gates were shut. He found a projecting house wall and huddled beneath it. This house belonged to a beautiful widow, mistress of the Marquis Azzo, who was expected that night. The Marquis, however, was called away and sent word he would not come. The lady, having prepared a bath and supper, decided to use them herself. In the bath, she heard Rinaldo's chattering. Her maid investigated and found Rinaldo, who explained his predicament. The lady, taking pity, let him in. She offered him the warm bath, then clothes belonging to her recently deceased husband, which fit him perfectly.

The lady, whose desires had been aroused by the expectation of the Marquis, found Rinaldo handsome and well-mannered. She hinted at her desire, and Rinaldo, no simpleton, eagerly embraced her. They spent the night together. In the morning, she gave him some poor clothes and a purse of money, then let him out. As he entered the town, he found his servant. Miraculously, the three highwaymen who robbed him were caught for another crime and confessed, leading to the return of Rinaldo's horse, clothes, and money (except for a pair of garters). Rinaldo, thanking God and St. Julian, returned home rich and safe, while the robbers were hanged.

**Story 3: Three Young Men (Pampinea)**
Pampinea tells of Messer Tedaldo of Florence, a rich gentleman with three handsome and sprightly sons: Lamberto, Tedaldo, and Agolante. After their father's death, they squandered their inheritance on lavish living. When they became poor, the eldest, Lamberto, persuaded his brothers to sell their remaining possessions and move to London, where they became successful usurers. They returned to Florence, bought back their estates, and married. They sent their nephew, Alessandro, to manage their affairs in England.

In Florence, the brothers resumed their extravagant spending. Alessandro, lending money to barons, prospered for a while. However, a war broke out between the King of England and his son, causing Alessandro to lose his investments. The brothers in Florence, still spending heavily, lost their credit and were imprisoned. Their wives and children were left in misery. Alessandro, fearing for his life in England, decided to return to Italy.

Leaving Bruges, he encountered an abbot of white friars, accompanied by knights. He learned the ""abbot"" was a young gentleman newly elected abbot, traveling to Rome for a dispensation due to his youth. The abbot, seeing Alessandro's good looks and manners, was instantly smitten. Alessandro, recounting his misfortunes, was comforted by the abbot, who invited him to travel to Tuscany together.

One night, at a poorly equipped village inn, Alessandro arranged the abbot's lodging. The abbot, unable to sleep due to his desire for Alessandro, called him to his bed. Alessandro, initially fearing unnatural love, was reassured when the abbot revealed herself to be a woman, the King of England's daughter, fleeing a forced marriage. She confessed her love for him and proposed marriage. Alessandro, recognizing her noble company and beauty, agreed. They secretly married before a picture of Christ.

In Rome, the princess, still disguised as an abbot, revealed her true identity and purpose to the Pope, presenting Alessandro as her chosen husband. The Pope, after appeasing her incensed kinsmen, solemnized the marriage. Alessandro and the princess traveled to Florence, where she secured the release of his uncles by paying their debts and restored their estates. She and Alessandro, with Agolante (one of the uncles), then went to Paris, where they were honored by the King. The princess's kinsmen reconciled her with her father, the King of England, who welcomed Alessandro, knighted him, and made him Earl of Cornwall. Alessandro reconciled the King with his son, gaining favor. Agolante recovered his wealth and returned to Florence. Alessandro and his wife lived long and gloriously, with some believing he later became King of Scotland.

**Story 4: Landolfo Ruffolo (Lauretta)**
Lauretta tells of Landolfo Ruffolo, a rich man from Ravello on the Amalfi coast, who sought to double his wealth. He bought a ship, loaded it with merchandise, and sailed to Cyprus. There, he found too many similar goods, forcing him to sell at a great loss, almost ruining him. Desperate, he sold his ship, bought a small vessel, and became a corsair, preying on Turkish ships. Fortune favored him, and he not only recovered his losses but doubled his original wealth. Content, he decided to return home.

Near the Archipelago, a storm forced him to shelter near a small island. Two large Genoese carracks, also seeking shelter, spotted his ship. Knowing his wealth, the rapacious Genoese attacked and captured him, taking all his goods and scuttling his ship. Landolfo was left with only a doublet on one of the carracks. The next day, another storm separated the carracks. The one carrying Landolfo struck a shoal near Cephalonia and broke apart. Landolfo, who had wished for death earlier, now clung to a plank.

He drifted for a day and a night. The next day, a gust of wind threw a chest against his plank, overturning it. He swam to the chest and clung to its lid. He drifted for another day and night, without food, drinking seawater, until he reached the coast of Corfu, almost dead. A poor woman, cleaning pots on the beach, saw him and, initially frightened, then took pity. She dragged him and the chest ashore. After reviving him, she returned his chest. Landolfo, having no memory of it, was disappointed by its lightness but opened it to find it full of precious stones. He praised God. Fearing further misfortune, he wrapped the jewels in rags, told the woman she could keep the empty chest, and gave her thanks. He traveled to Brindisi, then Trani, where he met townsmen who clothed him and sent him home to Ravello. There, he sold his jewels, becoming twice as rich as before. He sent money to the woman in Corfu and those in Trani, living honorably and never trading again.

**Story 5: Andreuccio of Perugia (Fiammetta)**
Fiammetta tells of Andreuccio di Pietro, a young horse-courser from Perugia, who went to Naples with 500 gold florins to buy horses. In the market, he foolishly displayed his purse. A beautiful Sicilian courtesan, Madam Fiordaliso, noticed his money. An old woman, who knew Andreuccio's father, greeted him, and the courtesan, learning his name and lodging, plotted to rob him. She sent her maid to invite him to her house. Andreuccio, thinking he was handsome and that the lady was in love with him, followed the maid to a disreputable street called Malpertugio.

The lady, feigning to be his long-lost sister (daughter of his father Pietro by a noble Palermitan lady), embraced him tearfully and told a fabricated story of her life, her marriage to a Guelph gentleman, and their flight to Naples. Andreuccio, believing her, was overjoyed to find a sister. She insisted he stay for supper, sending a fake message to his inn. After a sumptuous supper, she convinced him to stay the night, citing the dangers of Naples.

Andreuccio, alone in her perfumed chamber, stripped to his doublet and laid his hose with his purse by the bed. Needing to relieve himself, he asked a boy, who directed him to a door. He stepped onto a loose plank, which gave way, dropping him into a cesspit. The boy, hearing him fall, told his mistress, who quickly took Andreuccio's clothes and money and locked the door. Andreuccio, realizing the trick, climbed out, stinking, and tried to re-enter the house, but it was locked. He cried out, lamenting his lost florins and ""sister."" Neighbors, awakened, told him to leave. A bully from inside the house threatened him. Terrified, Andreuccio fled.

Desperate and stinking, he sought to wash in the sea but encountered two men with a lantern. Fearing them, he hid in a hovel. The men, thieves, entered the hovel, smelled him, and discovered him. He told them his story. They, recognizing the courtesan's house, told him he was lucky to have fallen, as he would have been murdered. They then invited him to join them in robbing the tomb of a recently buried archbishop, who had a valuable ruby.

At the cathedral, they found the tomb. The bucket at a nearby well was missing, so they tied Andreuccio to a rope to lower him for a wash. As he was lowered, watchmen approached, and the thieves fled. The watchmen, thirsty, pulled up the rope, expecting water. Andreuccio, reaching the top, let go and grabbed the well's edge, scaring the watchmen, who fled. He climbed out, found the watchmen's arms, and, confused, wandered off. He met his two comrades, who were amazed to see him. They explained their flight and the watchmen's fright.

They proceeded to the archbishop's tomb, lifted the heavy lid, and forced Andreuccio to enter. Fearing they would abandon him, he quickly took the ruby from the archbishop's finger and passed out the crozier, mitre, and gloves, claiming there was nothing else. The thieves, demanding the ring, pulled away the prop, trapping him inside. Andreuccio, despairing, fainted on the corpse. He awoke, fearing death by hunger or hanging. He then heard more thieves approaching. They opened the tomb, and a priest, brave enough to enter, put his legs in. Andreuccio grabbed his leg, scaring the priest, who shrieked and fled, followed by the others. Andreuccio escaped, with the ruby, and returned to his inn. He told his comrades and the host his adventures. Advised to leave Naples, he departed. Miraculously, the two thieves who robbed him were caught for another crime, and his horse, clothes, and money were restored (except for the garters). He returned to Perugia, having exchanged his florins for a ruby.

**Story 6: Madam Beritola (Emilia)**
Emilia tells of Madam Beritola Caracciola, wife of Arrighetto Capece, a Neapolitan gentleman in high favor with King Manfred of Sicily. When King Charles I defeated Manfred, Arrighetto was imprisoned. Beritola, pregnant and fearing for her safety, fled with her eight-year-old son, Giusfredi, to Lipari. There, she gave birth to another son, Scacciato. On their way back to Naples, their ship was driven by a storm to the deserted island of Ponza. Beritola, grieving for her husband, often went ashore to lament. One day, a pirate galley captured her ship and all its occupants, including her children and nurse, while she was ashore.

Returning, she saw the galley towing her ship away, realizing she had lost everything. She fainted, then, recovering, searched for her children in vain. Resigned, she found shelter in a cave. One day, she saw a she-goat enter a nearby cave and found two newborn kids. Her milk still flowing, she suckled them, and they adopted her. She lived like a wild creature, eating herbs, drinking water, and weeping for her lost family.

Months later, a Pisan vessel carrying Currado Malespina and his wife, returning from a pilgrimage, landed on Ponza. Their dogs chased the now-grown kids into Beritola's cave. Beritola, appearing wild and haggard, defended the kids. Currado and his wife, moved by her story, offered to take her home. She refused to return to Naples but agreed to go to Lunigiana with them, bringing her goats. She lived discreetly in Currado's castle as a waiting-woman, known as Cavriuola (wild she-goat).

Meanwhile, the pirates who captured her children sold them and the nurse to Messer Guasparrino d'Oria in Genoa, who used them as slaves. The nurse, to protect the children, changed Giusfredi's name to Giannotto di Procida and taught him to conceal his identity. Giannotto, at sixteen, fled Genoa and became a soldier. After three or four years, hearing his father was alive but imprisoned, he despaired and took service with Currado Malespina. He often saw his mother, but neither recognized the other due to the changes wrought by time and hardship.

Currado's daughter, Spina, a young widow, fell in love with Giannotto, and they became lovers. Their indiscretion led to their discovery by Currado and his wife. Enraged, Currado imprisoned them, intending to kill them. His wife, however, persuaded him to spare their lives, and they were kept in harsh conditions. After a year, Giannotto heard of King Pedro of Aragon's rebellion in Sicily against King Charles. He sighed, lamenting his imprisonment, as his father Arrighetto Capece had been a lord in Sicily. His gaoler reported this to Currado.

Currado, realizing Giannotto's true identity, spoke to Madam Beritola, who confirmed she had a son named Giusfredi, now twenty-two. Currado saw a way to redeem his daughter's honor and do a great mercy. He questioned Giannotto, confirming his identity, and offered him Spina's hand in marriage, along with wealth and status. Giannotto, despite his imprisonment, accepted, affirming his love for Spina. Currado, impressed by his spirit, embraced him and arranged the marriage.

To gladden their mothers, Currado revealed the news. Beritola, hearing of her son's marriage, recognized Giannotto by an ""occult virtue"" and embraced him, fainting from joy. They recounted their misfortunes. Giusfredi then asked Currado to find his brother Scacciato and his father Arrighetto. Messengers were sent to Genoa and Sicily. In Genoa, Messer Guasparrino d'Oria, hearing the full story from the nurse (who now revealed the truth), was amazed. To amend his mean usage of Scacciato, he married him to his own daughter and brought them to Currado's castle.

The family's reunion was joyous. The messenger from Sicily arrived, reporting that Arrighetto Capece had been freed during the revolt, made a captain, and restored to his honors by King Pedro. He had sent a brigantine for his wife and sons. The family, including Spina, embarked for Sicily, where Arrighetto received them with immense joy. They all lived happily, remembering God's mercy and gratitude.

**Story 7: Alatiel (Pamfilo)**
Pamfilo tells of Alatiel, daughter of Soldan Berminedab of Babylon, renowned as the most beautiful woman of her time. She was promised in marriage to the King of Algarve as a reward for his service. She embarked on a ship with an honorable company and rich dowry. Near Majorca, a violent storm struck. The sailors, fearing the ship would sink, abandoned it in a shallop, which then foundered, killing them all. Alatiel and her women, unconscious, were left on the waterlogged ship.

The ship eventually stranded on Majorca. Alatiel awoke to find her companions dead or dying. A gentleman, Pericone da Visalgo, discovered the ship and brought Alatiel and the most precious goods ashore. He was captivated by her beauty and, unable to communicate with her, resolved to marry or seduce her. Alatiel, realizing she was among Christians and unable to reveal her identity, resolved to protect her chastity and instructed her remaining women to do the same. Pericone, frustrated by her resistance, decided to use cunning. Knowing she enjoyed wine (forbidden by her law), he plied her with it at a supper. Intoxicated, she danced and then, unashamed, undressed and went to bed. Pericone joined her, and she, having never known a man, found pleasure in his embraces. She then willingly sought his company.

Pericone's brother, Marato, also fell in love with Alatiel. He plotted with two Genoese shipmasters to abduct her. They secretly entered Pericone's house, killed him in his sleep, and carried off Alatiel and many valuables. They embarked for Chiarenza in Roumelia. Marato comforted Alatiel, and she soon became familiar with him. However, the two Genoese shipmasters also became enamored of her. They conspired, threw Marato overboard, and then argued over who would possess her. They fought, one killing the other and the survivor being grievously wounded.

Alatiel, now alone and fearing the dead man's kinsmen, went ashore with the wounded shipmaster to an inn in Chiarenza. Her beauty attracted the Prince of Morea, who was instantly smitten. The wounded man's kinsmen, hearing of the Prince's desire, sent Alatiel to him. The Prince, impressed by her royal manners, treated her as his wife. Her beauty became famous throughout Roumelia. The Duke of Athens, the Prince's kinsman, came to see her and also fell deeply in love. Overcome by passion, he conspired with a chamberlain, Ciuriaci, to kill the Prince. They stabbed the Prince and threw him and Ciuriaci (whom they also killed) from a window into the sea. The Duke then lay with Alatiel, who thought him to be the Prince. He then abducted her to a country house near Athens, keeping her secret from his wife.

The Prince's death was discovered, and the Duke was suspected. The new Prince (the dead Prince's brother) declared war on the Duke. The Emperor of Constantinople sent his son Constantine and nephew Manuel to aid the Duke. The Duchess, Constantine's sister, complained to them about the Duke's secret mistress. Constantine, hearing of Alatiel's beauty, also desired her. Feigning illness, he returned to Athens, then conspired with the Duchess to abduct Alatiel, ostensibly to remove the source of her husband's infidelity. He seized Alatiel from the garden and took her by ship to Chios.

In Chios, Alatiel again found solace with Constantine. However, Osbech, King of the Turks, attacked Chios, capturing Alatiel and Constantine. Osbech, captivated by Alatiel's beauty, married her. Meanwhile, the Emperor of Constantinople allied with Bassano, King of Cappadocia, against Osbech. Osbech went to war, leaving Alatiel with his servant Antiochus. Antiochus, falling in love with Alatiel, began an affair with her. When Osbech was defeated and killed, Antiochus and Alatiel fled to Rhodes with valuables. Antiochus then fell ill and, on his deathbed, entrusted Alatiel and his possessions to a Cypriot merchant, his friend. The merchant, taking Alatiel to Cyprus, claimed her as his wife. During the journey, they also became lovers.

In Baffa, Cyprus, Alatiel was seen by Antigonus, an old gentleman who had served her father. She recognized him and revealed her true identity and her misfortunes. Antigonus, realizing her royal lineage, promised to restore her to her father and the King of Algarve. He advised her to tell a fabricated story of her journey, omitting her many lovers, claiming she was shipwrecked, rescued by Christians, and lived chastely in a convent. The King of Cyprus, at Antigonus's request, sent her back to the Soldan. Alatiel, following Antigonus's instructions, told her false story. Antigonus corroborated it, emphasizing her chastity. The Soldan, overjoyed, sent her to the King of Algarve. Alatiel, having lain with eight men, was presented as a virgin and married the King of Algarve, living happily with him. Pamfilo concludes, ""Lips for kissing forfeit no favour; nay, they renew as the moon doth ever.""

**Story 8: The Count of Antwerp (Elisa)**
Elisa tells of Gautier, Count of Antwerp, appointed vicar-general of France by the King and his son, who were at war with the Germans. Gautier, a handsome and accomplished gentleman, was entrusted with the care of the queen and the king's daughter-in-law. The daughter-in-law, young and lusty, fell passionately in love with Gautier. She confessed her love to him, arguing that her wealth and leisure excused her passion, and his worth justified her choice. Gautier, a loyal gentleman, sternly rejected her, declaring he would rather die than betray his lord. Enraged, she tore her clothes and cried out that Gautier was trying to rape her.

Gautier, fearing the courtiers' envy and the lady's malice, fled immediately with his two young children, Louis (9) and Violante (7), to Calais, then to England, disguised in mean apparel. He instructed his children to keep their identities secret and to endure poverty patiently. In London, a marshal's wife, taking pity on the children, adopted Violante (renamed Jeannette). Gautier, now alone with Louis (renamed Perrot), traveled to Wales, where another marshal, impressed by Perrot's prowess in boyish sports, adopted him. Gautier then went to Ireland, taking service as a horseboy, enduring much hardship.

Jeannette grew up beautiful and virtuous, beloved by all. The marshal's son, Jamy Lamiens, fell in love with her. Believing her to be of low birth, he kept his love secret, which made him gravely ill. Physicians despaired. One doctor, observing Jamy's pulse quicken whenever Jeannette entered the room, deduced the cause. Jamy's parents, though reluctant to marry him to a commoner, agreed to give him Jeannette to save his life. Jeannette, valuing her honor, initially refused to be a mistress but agreed to marry Jamy.

Perrot, in Wales, also grew into a valiant man. A plague killed his lord, the marshal, and his family, leaving only a daughter. Perrot married her and became the new marshal.

Eighteen years after his flight, Gautier, now old and changed, returned to England to find his children. He found Perrot a great lord and Jeannette married to Jamy, both in good standing. He did not reveal himself. Jamy, taking pity on the old, poor man, hired him as a horseboy. Jamy's father, still despising Jeannette's low birth, made a disparaging remark about her children ""harking back to that whence they sprang"" (i.e., vagabonds). Gautier, though hurt, endured it.

The King of France died, and his son (whose wife had accused Gautier) became king. War broke out again. Perrot and Jamy led English forces. Gautier, still disguised as a horseboy, accompanied them, performing valiantly. The Queen of France, on her deathbed, confessed her false accusation against Gautier to the Archbishop of Rouen and other noblemen, begging them to restore him to his rightful place. The King, hearing this, proclaimed a reward for anyone who could find Gautier or his children.

Gautier, hearing the proclamation, revealed himself to Jamy and Perrot. Jamy, ashamed of his past insults, begged forgiveness. Gautier, still in his horseboy's attire, was presented to the King, who recognized him and, with tears, embraced him. The King restored Gautier to all his honors, making him even greater than before. Jamy received a magnificent reward for finding Gautier and his children. Jeannette and Perrot's wife joined them in Paris. Gautier, with his family, lived honorably in Paris.

**Story 9: Bernabo of Genoa (Filomena)**
Filomena tells of Italian merchants in Paris discussing their wives' fidelity. Bernabo Lomellini of Genoa boasted of his wife's unparalleled virtue and chastity. Ambrogiuolo of Piacenza scoffed, arguing that all women are naturally unstable and that a discreet woman's chastity is only a matter of secrecy. He wagered 5,000 gold florins against Bernabo's 1,000 that he could seduce Bernabo's wife within three months and bring back proof. Bernabo, confident, accepted the wager despite others' warnings.

Ambrogiuolo went to Genoa, learned about Bernabo's wife, Madam Ginevra, and found her to be as virtuous as described. He bribed a poor woman who frequented the house to hide him in a chest in Ginevra's bedchamber. For two nights, he emerged from the chest while Ginevra slept, observing the room and her person. He noted a mole under her left breast with golden hairs. He also stole a purse, a night-rail, rings, and girdles. On the third day, the woman retrieved the chest.

Ambrogiuolo returned to Paris before the deadline and claimed victory. He described the chamber and presented the stolen items. Bernabo acknowledged the description and the items but argued they could have been obtained through servants. Ambrogiuolo then revealed the mole under Ginevra's left breast. Bernabo, struck as if by a knife, instantly knew it was true. He paid Ambrogiuolo and returned to Genoa, consumed by rage.

He sent a trusted servant with letters to his wife, telling her to meet him at a country house. Secretly, he ordered the servant to kill her in a lonely place. The servant, unwilling to murder her, revealed Bernabo's command. Ginevra, swearing secrecy, persuaded him to take her clothes and present them to Bernabo as proof of her death, while she fled in the servant's doublet and hood. She gave him money and disappeared. The servant reported to Bernabo that he had killed her and left her body to wolves. Bernabo returned to Genoa, where he was blamed for his cruelty.

Ginevra, disguised as a sailor named Sicurano da Finale, took service with a Catalan gentleman. She served him so well that he took her on a voyage to Alexandria, where he presented falcons to the Soldan. The Soldan, impressed by Sicurano, requested him from his master. Sicurano gained the Soldan's favor. At a merchant fair in Acre, Sicurano saw a purse and girdle that had been hers in a Venetian merchant's shop. The merchant, Ambrogiuolo, came forward, laughing, and recounted how he won them from Ginevra and how Bernabo had her killed.

Sicurano, realizing Ambrogiuolo was the cause of her misfortunes, feigned amusement and befriended him, bringing him to Alexandria. Sicurano then arranged for Bernabo to come to Alexandria on a plausible pretext. Before the Soldan, Sicurano (still disguised) forced Ambrogiuolo to confess his deception. Bernabo, present, admitted to ordering his wife's death. Sicurano then dramatically revealed herself as Ginevra, tearing open her clothes to show the mole. The Soldan, astonished, praised Ginevra's virtue and constancy. He pardoned Bernabo at her request. Bernabo, weeping, begged her forgiveness, which she granted. The Soldan ordered Ambrogiuolo to be bound to a stake, smeared with honey, and left to die by insects. He gave Ginevra all of Ambrogiuolo's wealth and more, then sent her and Bernabo back to Genoa, rich and reconciled. Ambrogiuolo died a slow, agonizing death.

**Story 10: Paganino of Monaco (Dioneo)**
Dioneo tells of Messer Ricciardo di Chinzica, a wealthy but physically weak judge in Pisa, who married the young and beautiful Bartolomea. Ricciardo, more interested in his studies than his wife, taught her a ""calendar"" of saints' days, Emberdays, and other occasions when marital relations were forbidden, effectively limiting their intimacy to maybe once a month. Bartolomea was deeply unhappy.

One day, while Ricciardo and Bartolomea were fishing near Monte Nero, a famous corsair, Paganino da Mare, abducted Bartolomea in sight of her husband. Paganino, finding her beautiful and having no wife, decided to keep her. He comforted her with words, and that night, he comforted her with deeds, making her forget her husband and his ""calendar."" She began to live merrily with Paganino in Monaco, where he treated her honorably as his wife.

Ricciardo, learning where she was, traveled to Monaco to ransom her. He befriended Paganino, who feigned ignorance of his identity. Ricciardo, revealing his purpose, asked for his wife back. Paganino agreed, on the condition that if the lady recognized Ricciardo and wished to return, he would release her for a ransom of Ricciardo's choosing; but if she did not, he would keep her. Ricciardo, confident, agreed.

Paganino brought Ricciardo to Bartolomea. She greeted Ricciardo as a stranger, much to his astonishment. He tried to remind her of their marriage, but she, smiling, denied knowing him. Ricciardo, thinking she feared Paganino, asked to speak with her alone. Paganino agreed, with the condition he wouldn't kiss her against her will. Alone, Ricciardo pleaded with her, but she laughed and confirmed she knew him. She then bitterly recounted his neglect and his ""calendar"" of prohibitions, contrasting it with Paganino's constant affection and vigor. She declared she would stay with Paganino, who knew no ""holidays"" in bed, and would only return to Ricciardo when she was old.

Ricciardo, distraught, recognized his folly. He returned to Pisa, where he died of chagrin, constantly repeating, ""The ill hole will have no holidays."" Paganino, hearing of Ricciardo's death, married Bartolomea, and they lived happily, never observing any ""saints' days or vigils"" in their love.

**Conclusion of Day the Second**
The company laughed heartily at Dioneo's story, agreeing that Bernabo had been foolish. Filomena, her reign ended, crowned Neifile as the new queen. Neifile, after recovering from her blushes, confirmed the existing rules. She announced that the next two days (Friday and Saturday) would be dedicated to devotion and rest, as Friday commemorated Christ's passion and Saturday was for cleansing and preparing for Sunday. She proposed that on Sunday, they would move to a new location and the theme would be ""OF SUCH AS HAVE, BY DINT OF DILIGENCE, ACQUIRED SOME MUCH DESIRED THING OR RECOVERED SOME LOST GOOD."" Dioneo's privilege to tell any story he wished was maintained. They then enjoyed the evening with music and dancing.

**Day the Third**

**Introduction**
On Sunday morning, at dawn, the company, led by Queen Neifile, walked to a beautiful palace on a knoll, a short distance away. They admired its grand halls, elegant chambers, spacious courtyard, cool cellars, and abundant water. They then entered a magnificent walled garden, filled with trellised vines, roses, jasmine, and fruit trees, all fragrant and green. In the center was a perfectly green lawn with a white marble fountain, from which a powerful jet of water rose and flowed into channels throughout the garden, powering two mills before descending to the plain. The garden also contained many tame animals like rabbits, hares, kids, and fawns. The company agreed it was like an earthly paradise. After enjoying the garden, they dined by the fountain, then engaged in music, singing, and dancing. After a siesta, they reassembled by the fountain for storytelling. Filostrato was chosen to begin.

**Story 1: Masetto of Lamporecchio (Filostrato)**
Filostrato tells of Masetto, a young, robust, and handsome laborer. He heard Nuto, a former gardener at a convent of young nuns, complain about the low wages and the nuns' constant demands. Nuto also mentioned that the nuns were all young and seemed ""possessed of the devil,"" implying their suppressed desires. Masetto, realizing the convent was isolated and he was young and attractive, decided to feign dumbness to get the job. He arrived at the convent with an axe, making signs that he sought alms and would cleave wood. The bailiff, impressed by his strength, hired him. The abbess, Madam Usimbalda, also saw him and, believing him deaf and dumb and therefore harmless to her ""lasses,"" approved his employment as gardener.

Masetto, working in the garden, was often teased and spoken naughtily to by the nuns, who thought he couldn't understand. One day, two young nuns, discussing their strict confinement and the pleasures of men (which they had heard from visitors), decided to test their desires with the ""mute"" gardener, believing he couldn't tell. They led him to a hut, and one by one, they lay with him. They found the experience delectable. Soon, other nuns discovered their secret, and eventually, all eight nuns became Masetto's lovers.

One day, the abbess, walking in the garden, saw Masetto asleep, his clothes disarranged, revealing his body. She, too, was overcome by desire. She took him to her chamber and kept him for several days, much to the other nuns' annoyance, who complained the gardener wasn't tending the garden. The abbess also frequently sought his company. Masetto, unable to satisfy all nine women, decided to break his silence. One night, with the abbess, he spoke, complaining that one man could not satisfy nine women, and he was exhausted.

The abbess, astonished to hear him speak, asked if he was truly dumb. Masetto claimed a malady had taken his speech, and it had only just returned. The abbess, realizing the truth about her nuns, discreetly consulted them. They all confessed their secret affairs with Masetto. To avoid scandal, they agreed to pretend Masetto's speech was miraculously restored through their prayers. They made him bailiff, dividing his duties to make them manageable, and continued their discreet affairs. Masetto, having used his youth well, returned home rich and a father, without the expense of raising children.

**Story 2: King Agilulf (Pampinea)**
Pampinea tells of Agilulf, King of the Lombards, and his discreet and virtuous wife, Queen Theodolinda. A horsekeeper, a man of low birth but noble spirit and handsome, fell deeply in love with the Queen. Knowing his love was hopeless, he resolved to die, but first to try to lie with her, disguised as the King. He observed the King's routine: Agilulf would enter the Queen's chamber at night, wrapped in a mantle, with a taper and a wand, strike the door twice, and then be admitted.

The horsekeeper acquired a similar mantle, taper, and wand. After bathing to remove any tell-tale odors, he hid in the palace. When he knew everyone was asleep, he lit his taper, wrapped himself in the mantle, struck the Queen's door twice, and was admitted by a sleepy chamberwoman. He entered the bed, and feigning to be troubled (as the King sometimes was, making him disinclined to talk), he lay with the Queen several times. Then, fearing discovery, he arose, took his mantle and light, and returned to his bed.

Soon after, the King himself came to the Queen's chamber. She, thinking it was his second visit, asked, ""O my lord, what new fashion is this of to-night? You left me but now, after having taken pleasure of me beyond your wont, and do you return so soon?"" The King realized she had been deceived. Being wise, he chose not to expose her or himself to shame. He feigned to be capable of multiple visits and left, enraged but silent, determined to find the culprit.

He suspected it was a member of his household. He took a small lantern and went to the gallery above the stables where his servants slept. He felt each man's breast, looking for a rapidly beating heart. The horsekeeper, still awake and guessing the King's purpose, was terrified, his heart pounding even harder. The King, feeling the rapid pulse, knew he had found his man. To identify him later without causing a stir, he quietly clipped a lock of the horsekeeper's long hair. He then returned to his chamber.

The horsekeeper, realizing he had been marked, immediately arose, found shears, and clipped a similar lock of hair from every other man in the gallery. In the morning, the King ordered all his household to present themselves. Seeing most of them with clipped hair, he realized the trick. He understood the culprit's wit and, unwilling to cause a scandal for a ""paltry revenge,"" simply said, ""Let him who did it do it no more and get you gone in peace."" Only the horsekeeper understood the warning. He never revealed the matter and never repeated his venture during Agilulf's lifetime.

**Story 3: A Lady and a Friar (Filomena)**
Filomena tells of a noble, witty, and beautiful Florentine lady, married to a wealthy but common wool-monger. Disdaining her husband's embraces, she fell in love with a worthy gentleman. Unable to communicate with him directly due to societal constraints and fear of discovery, she noticed he often conversed with a friar, a dull but reputedly holy man. She decided to use the friar as an unwitting go-between.

She went to the friar for confession. After confessing, she complained about a gentleman (describing her lover) who persistently pursued her, appearing everywhere she went. She claimed it caused her great annoyance and threatened her honor, and she feared telling her brothers might lead to violence. She begged the friar to rebuke him and make him stop. She also asked him to tell the gentleman that she had complained. She then gave the friar money for masses. The friar, believing her, promised to intervene.

The friar found the gentleman and, without letting him speak, sternly rebuked him for pursuing the lady, saying she had complained personally. The gentleman, quicker-witted than the friar, immediately understood the lady's clever message. Feigning shame, he promised to desist. He then went to the lady's house, where she, seeing him, showed great joy, confirming his understanding. From then on, he passed by her house frequently under various pretexts.

Later, to further inflame her lover and prove her love, the lady returned to the friar, weeping. She complained that the gentleman had intensified his pursuit, sending her gifts (a purse and a girdle). She claimed to be so angry she almost ""played the devil"" but had restrained herself for the friar's sake. She gave the gifts to the friar, asking him to return them and warn the gentleman to stop, or she would tell her husband and brothers. The friar, enraged, promised to ""warm his ears"" and took the gifts. He then angrily confronted the gentleman, who, feigning embarrassment, accepted the gifts and promised to stop.

The gentleman, overjoyed, displayed the gifts to his mistress, confirming their understanding. When her husband left for Genoa, the lady again went to the friar, weeping. She claimed the gentleman had tried to enter her chamber by climbing a tree, and she had barely repelled him. She threatened to tell her husband. The friar, furious, again confronted the gentleman, who, now fully informed of the lady's intentions, promised to stop. That night, the gentleman, using the tree, entered the lady's chamber. They made love, laughing at the foolish friar, and arranged future rendezvous without his help.

**Story 4: Dom Felice (Pamfilo)**
Pamfilo tells of Fra Puccio, a rich but ignorant man in Florence, who became a devout Franciscan tertiary. His young, beautiful, and lusty wife, Mistress Isabetta, suffered from his piety and lack of marital attention. Dom Felice, a young, handsome, and learned Conventual monk, became Fra Puccio's friend. Felice, observing Isabetta's situation, desired her. He subtly expressed his interest, and she, receptive, agreed to an affair, but only in her own house, which was difficult as Fra Puccio was always home.

Felice devised a plan. He told Fra Puccio there was a short path to sainthood, known only to a few, which he would reveal if Puccio swore secrecy. Puccio eagerly agreed. Felice instructed him to confess diligently, fast strictly for forty days (abstaining from his wife), and spend every night from complines (9 p.m.) until matins (3 a.m.) standing upright, crucifix-fashion, leaning against a plank in a place where he could see the sky, meditating on God and Christ's passion. He was to say 300 Paternosters and 300 Ave Marias. After matins, he could sleep. During the day, he was to attend three masses and say 50 Paternosters and Aves. Felice claimed this penance would purge past sins and make future venial sins easily forgiven.

Puccio, delighted, told his wife, who, understanding Felice's true intent, readily agreed to his penance, even promising to fast with him. Fra Puccio began his penance. Felice, as arranged with Isabetta, came nightly to sup and lie with her until matins, when he would leave, and Puccio would return to bed. One night, as Felice and Isabetta were making love, Fra Puccio, in his adjoining room, felt the house shake. He called to his wife, asking what she was doing. Isabetta, laughing, replied she was ""tossing"" because ""who suppeth not by night must toss till morning light."" Puccio, in his simplicity, believed her lack of sleep was due to fasting and told her to rest.

After that night, Felice and Isabetta moved their rendezvous to another part of the house. Fra Puccio continued his penance, while his wife enjoyed the monk. Isabetta often joked to Felice, ""Thou hast put Fra Puccio upon performing a penance, whereby we have gotten Paradise."" After Puccio completed his penance, Isabetta continued her affair with Felice discreetly. Pamfilo concludes that Fra Puccio, seeking Paradise for himself, instead sent the monk and his wife there.

**Story 5: Ricciardo, surnamed Il Zima (Elisa)**
Elisa tells of Messer Francesco Vergellesi, a wealthy but avaricious gentleman in Pistoia. He needed a handsome palfrey for his new provostship in Milan. Ricciardo, known as Il Zima, a rich but low-born young man, was desperately in love with Messer Francesco's virtuous wife. Il Zima owned the finest palfrey in Tuscany. Messer Francesco, hearing that Il Zima might give him the horse for his wife's love, sought to buy it. Il Zima offered it as a gift, on condition that he be allowed to speak privately with Messer Francesco's wife in her husband's presence, but out of earshot of others.

Messer Francesco, driven by avarice, agreed. He instructed his wife, Caterina, to listen but not to reply. Il Zima then passionately declared his undying love for Caterina, lamenting her past cruelty and begging for her pity, threatening to die if she refused. Caterina, though moved by his words and feeling a nascent love, remained silent due to her husband's command. Il Zima, realizing the husband's trick, cleverly began to speak *as if* he were Caterina, replying to himself. He said that she had always loved him but had to maintain her honor. He then promised that when Messer Francesco left for Milan, she would meet him. He instructed him to look for two napkins displayed at her garden window as a signal, and then to come to the garden door at nightfall.

Il Zima then resumed his own voice, thanking the ""lady"" for her gracious reply. Caterina remained silent. Il Zima then turned to Messer Francesco, saying he had spoken with a ""marble statue."" Messer Francesco, pleased with his wife's apparent virtue, took the palfrey. A few days later, he departed for Milan. Caterina, reflecting on Il Zima's words, her husband's neglect, and her own youth, decided to seize the opportunity. She displayed the two napkins. Il Zima saw them and that night, entered the garden, where Caterina awaited him. They made love, and their affair continued many times, even after Messer Francesco's return.

**Story 6: Ricciardo Minutolo (Fiammetta)**
Fiammetta tells of Ricciardo Minutolo, a noble and wealthy young man in Naples, who fell in love with Catella, the beautiful and virtuous wife of Filippello Fighinolfi. Catella loved her husband deeply and was fiercely jealous of him. Ricciardo, unable to win her love directly, devised a plan. He feigned despair and pretended to fall in love with another lady, publicly jousting and courting her. This convinced everyone, including Catella, that he no longer loved her. Catella, now less reserved, greeted him familiarly.

One day, at a seaside gathering, Ricciardo, alone with Catella, hinted that Filippello was having an affair. Catella, consumed by jealousy, begged him to explain. Ricciardo, extracting a promise of secrecy, told her that Filippello was trying to seduce Ricciardo's wife and had arranged a rendezvous at a bagnio (bathhouse) the next day at none (3 p.m.). Ricciardo claimed he had instructed his wife to agree but intended to send *Catella* in her place, so Catella could shame Filippello. Catella, enraged and believing him, agreed to the plan.

The next morning, Ricciardo arranged with the bagnio keeper to prepare a dark room. He hid there after dinner. Catella, full of fury, went to the bagnio at the appointed time. The keeper, following Ricciardo's instructions, confirmed Filippello was inside. Catella, with her head covered, entered the dark room and was embraced by Ricciardo, whom she believed to be her husband. She, feigning to be Ricciardo's wife, passionately made love with him.

After a while, Catella, still believing she was with Filippello, launched into a furious tirade, revealing her true identity and accusing him of infidelity and neglect, contrasting his current vigor with his usual feebleness. Ricciardo, enjoying her anger, continued to embrace her. Finally, he revealed his true identity. Catella was horrified and tried to flee, but Ricciardo held her, explaining his deception was born of love. He warned her that exposing him would ruin her honor (as he would claim she was a prostitute) and cause a deadly feud between him and her husband. He promised to be her devoted lover. Catella, though furious, recognized the truth in his words. She made peace with him, and from that day, she loved him tenderly. They continued their discreet affair, finding more pleasure in a lover's kisses than a husband's.

**Story 7: Tedaldo Elisei (Emilia)**
Emilia tells of Tedaldo Elisei, a noble Florentine youth, who loved Madam Ermellina, wife of Aldobrandino Palermini. After a period of mutual affection, Ermellina suddenly became cold and distant, refusing his messages and presence. Tedaldo, heartbroken, left Florence without telling anyone but a close friend. He went to Ancona, became a merchant, and prospered in Cyprus. Seven years later, hearing a song he had composed about his love, his desire to see Ermellina rekindled.

He returned to Florence disguised as a pilgrim from the Holy Sepulchre. He found his mistress's house closed and then saw his four brothers in mourning. He learned from a cordwainer that his brothers believed he had been murdered by Aldobrandino Palermini, who was now imprisoned, accused of killing Tedaldo for having an affair with his wife. Tedaldo was amazed that someone had been mistaken for him and grieved for Aldobrandino. That night, at his inn, he overheard three men confessing to killing a stranger, mistaking him for Tedaldo, because he had annoyed one of their wives. They rejoiced that Aldobrandino was being blamed.

Tedaldo, realizing the injustice, decided to save Aldobrandino. The next morning, he went to Ermellina's house, found her weeping, and, still disguised, told her he was a pilgrim sent by God to turn her tears to laughter and save her husband. He recounted Aldobrandino's troubles and her own history, convincing her he was a prophet. He then told her her current affliction was due to her sin of abandoning Tedaldo Elisei, whom she had loved. He explained that friars, whom she had believed, were often corrupt and sought their own gain. He argued that her actions against Tedaldo were worse than adultery, as she had robbed him of herself and effectively sought his death. He then revealed that Tedaldo was not dead but alive.

Ermellina, convinced, promised to restore her love to Tedaldo if he returned. Tedaldo then revealed his identity by showing her a ring she had given him. Ermellina, initially terrified, then joyfully embraced him. Tedaldo, promising to return that night, went to the prison. Disguised as a ghostly comforter, he told Aldobrandino that God, pitying his innocence, would save him if he forgave Tedaldo's brothers. Aldobrandino agreed. Tedaldo then went to a magistrate, revealing the true murderers (the innkeepers he overheard). The innkeepers confessed, and Aldobrandino was released, while the murderers were executed.

That night, Tedaldo returned to Ermellina, who embraced him joyfully. They made love. The next day, Aldobrandino, grateful to the pilgrim, hosted him. Tedaldo then arranged a banquet where Aldobrandino's family and Tedaldo's brothers were present. During the meal, Tedaldo revealed his true identity. His brothers, initially ashamed, embraced him. Aldobrandino, with great magnanimity, forgave them. Tedaldo then tore off his brothers' mourning clothes, and they celebrated. The truth about the murdered man (Faziuolo of Pontremoli) was later discovered, confirming Tedaldo's story. Tedaldo and Ermellina lived long and happily, discreetly enjoying their love.

**Story 8: Ferondo (Lauretta)**
Lauretta tells of an abbot in Tuscany, a holy man except for his secret affairs with women. He became close to Ferondo, a wealthy but dull-witted farmer, whose beautiful wife he desired. Ferondo, despite his simplicity, was fiercely jealous. The abbot, a clever man, invited Ferondo and his wife to the abbey garden, where he preached about eternal life. The wife, Madam Ferondo, confessed to him, complaining about her husband's jealousy.

The abbot, seeing an opportunity, told her he could cure Ferondo's jealousy by sending him to purgatory. He explained that Ferondo would ""die"" for a time, and after suffering penance, God would restore him to life, cured of jealousy. The wife, initially shocked, agreed, provided she didn't remarry during his ""widowhood."" The abbot then demanded her love as his reward, claiming it was a ""sin of the body"" that did not diminish his sanctity. She, after some hesitation, agreed, but only after Ferondo was in purgatory. The abbot gave her a handsome ring.

The abbot then drugged Ferondo with a powerful powder (from the Old Man of the Mountain) that induced a three-day death-like sleep. Ferondo fell asleep in the cloister, and the monks, believing him dead, sent for his wife. After a public mourning, he was buried in a tomb. That night, the abbot and a trusted Bolognese monk secretly removed Ferondo from the tomb, dressed him as a monk, and placed him in a dark prison vault, instructing the Bolognese monk to keep him there and convince him he was in purgatory.

The abbot then visited Madam Ferondo, who was in mourning, and they began their affair. He visited her often, sometimes being seen by villagers who thought he was Ferondo doing penance. In the vault, the Bolognese monk would beat Ferondo twice daily, telling him it was punishment for his jealousy. He fed him food sent by his wife (for masses), which Ferondo complained about (especially the wine). Ferondo, believing he was dead and in purgatory, promised to be a better husband if he returned to life.

After ten months, Madam Ferondo became pregnant by the abbot. To avoid scandal, they decided to ""recall"" Ferondo from purgatory. The abbot, using a disguised voice, told Ferondo he would return to the world and have a son named Benedict. He then drugged Ferondo again, placed him back in his tomb, and sealed it. Ferondo awoke at dawn, called out, and was found by the monks, who fled in terror. The abbot, feigning surprise, led them back. Ferondo, believing he had been resurrected, thanked the abbot, his wife, and St. Benedict. He returned home, where he was treated as one risen from the dead. He continued to tell fantastical stories of purgatory. His wife gave birth to a son, Benedict, whom Ferondo believed was his. Cured of his jealousy, he lived honestly with his wife, who continued her discreet affair with the abbot.

**Story 9: Gillette de Narbonne (Neifile)**
Neifile tells of Gillette, daughter of Master Gerard de Narbonne, who loved Bertrand, Count of Roussillon, since childhood. Bertrand was left in the King of France's care after his father's death. Gillette's father died, and she, now of marriageable age, refused many suitors, still loving Bertrand. She heard the King of France suffered from an incurable fistula. Having learned medicine from her father, she prepared a powder and went to Paris.

She offered to cure the King in eight days without pain. The King, skeptical after many failed treatments, initially refused. Gillette, however, insisted she used her father's science and God's aid. The King, deciding to try, agreed to her terms: if she failed, she would be burned; if she succeeded, she would choose a husband from his court, excluding only his sons or royal kin. Gillette cured him. She then chose Bertrand.

Bertrand, disdainful of her lower birth (she was a ""she-leach""), refused. The King, bound by his promise, compelled him. Bertrand, against his will, married Gillette but immediately fled to Tuscany, joining the Florentine army against Sienna. He vowed he would only return to live with her if she had his ring (which he never removed) and a son by him in her arms – two seemingly impossible conditions.

Gillette, though heartbroken, went to Roussillon and, with great diligence, restored order to his neglected county, earning the love of his vassals. She sent two knights to Bertrand, offering to leave if her presence was the reason for his absence. He repeated his harsh conditions. Gillette, determined, left Roussillon, telling his vassals she was going on pilgrimage. She traveled to Florence, disguised as a poor pilgrim, and learned that Bertrand was having an affair with a poor but virtuous young lady.

Gillette secretly met the lady's mother, revealing her identity and misfortunes. She offered a generous dowry for the daughter if the mother would help her. The plan: the mother was to tell Bertrand her daughter would sleep with him if he sent his ring. Once Gillette had the ring, the mother would arrange a secret rendezvous, but put Gillette in the bed instead of her daughter. The mother, though hesitant, agreed. Gillette, lying with Bertrand, conceived two sons. She repeated the deception several times, collecting jewels Bertrand gave his supposed mistress.

When she was pregnant, Gillette revealed her success to the mother, who was pleased. Gillette, giving the mother a generous sum and jewels, returned to her inn. The mother then moved away, and Bertrand, hearing Gillette had left the county, returned. Gillette, after giving birth to two sons resembling Bertrand, traveled to Montpellier. She learned Bertrand was holding a festival in Roussillon. She went there, still in pilgrim's habit, and presented herself before him, revealing her sons and his ring, declaring she had met his conditions.

Bertrand was confounded but recognized the ring and his sons. Gillette recounted her entire story. Bertrand, seeing her constancy, wit, and the beautiful children, and urged by his vassals, accepted her as his lawful wife. He clothed her sumptuously, and they celebrated joyously. He honored her as his wife, and they lived happily. The story concludes that even in poor cottages, ""divine spirits"" can be found, and that Griselda's patience was extraordinary.

**Story 10: Alibech (Dioneo)**
Dioneo tells of Alibech, a beautiful and simple fourteen-year-old girl from Capsa in Barbary. Hearing Christians praise their faith, she asked how to serve God best. She was told that those who strictly eschewed worldly things, like hermits in the deserts of Thebais, served God best. She secretly set off alone to find a hermit. Two older hermits, fearing temptation, sent her away. She finally found a young, devout hermit named Rustico.

Rustico, wishing to test his own constancy, took her in. That night, temptation overwhelmed him. He decided to seduce her under the guise of serving God. He explained that the devil was God's enemy, and the most acceptable service was to ""put the devil in hell."" Alibech, innocent, asked how. Rustico stripped naked, and had her do the same. He knelt as if in prayer, and had her stand opposite him.

(The text then switches to Italian for a highly explicit passage, which is translated in a footnote by John Payne. The summary will use the translated content.)

Rustico, inflamed by her beauty, experienced ""the resurrection of the flesh."" Alibech, marveling, asked what the protruding thing was. Rustico called it the ""devil"" that gave him great annoyance. Alibech, noting she didn't have one, was pleased. Rustico then told her she had ""hell"" instead, and that God had sent her to him so he could ""put the devil in hell"" to relieve his annoyance. Alibech, in good faith, agreed. Rustico laid her on a bed and taught her how to ""imprison that accursed one of God."" Alibech felt a little pain at first, calling the devil an ""ill thing."" Rustico assured her it wouldn't always be so, and they repeated the act six times until the ""devil"" was ""at peace.""

As the ""sport"" continued daily, Alibech began to enjoy it, declaring that serving God was a ""sweet thing"" and ""putting the devil in hell"" was the greatest delight. She often urged Rustico, ""Father mine, I came here to serve God and not to abide idle; let us go put the devil in hell."" Rustico, exhausted, told her the devil was only to be chastised when it ""lifted up its head for pride,"" and his was now ""at peace."" Alibech then complained that her ""hell"" would not leave her alone and asked Rustico to help ""abate its raging."" Rustico, living on roots and water, could barely keep up.

Meanwhile, a fire in Capsa killed Alibech's father and family, leaving her heir to his wealth. Neerbale, a young man who had squandered his fortune, heard she was alive. He found her and, against her will, brought her back to Capsa, where he married her and inherited her wealth. When asked by other women how she served God in the desert, Alibech (who Neerbale had not yet lain with) replied she served Him by ""putting the devil in hell"" and lamented that Neerbale had taken her from such service. The women, laughing, asked how, and she explained. This became a common saying in the city, and then overseas. Dioneo concludes by advising all young ladies needing God's grace to learn to ""put the devil in hell.""

**Conclusion of Day the Third**
Dioneo's story caused much laughter. The queen, her reign ended, crowned Filostrato, joking that they would see if the ""wolf"" (Filostrato) could govern the ""ewes"" (ladies) better than the ewes had governed the wolves. Filostrato, laughing, accepted the crown and set the theme for the next day: ""OF THOSE WHOSE LOVES HAVE HAD UNHAPPY ENDINGS,"" as he expected an unhappy end to his own love. They then enjoyed the garden, some chasing animals, others playing chess or singing. After supper, Lauretta sang a plaintive song about lost love and regret, which was interpreted differently by various listeners. The king then dismissed them to rest.

**Day the Fourth**

**Introduction (Author's Defense)**
The author begins with a lengthy defense against critics. He notes that envy attacks even humble works. He addresses specific criticisms:
1.  **Pleasing women too much:** He confesses he enjoys pleasing women and finds them pleasing, especially their beauty, grace, and courtesy. He argues that if a hermit's son, raised in isolation, was instantly captivated by women, how can he, whose body was ""created all apt to love,"" be blamed?
2.  **Age inappropriateness:** He dismisses this, saying that ""the leek hath a white head, the tail thereof is green"" (implying he is still vigorous). He cites famous poets (Guido Cavalcanti, Dante Alighieri, Messer Cino da Pistoja) who honored women in their old age. He states that women are like the Muses, inspiring him to poetry.
3.  **Peddling baubles/feeding on wind:** He sarcastically suggests these critics would tell him to ""seek bread among thy fables"" if he asked them for it. He points out that poets have found more wealth in fables than rich men in treasures, and that many who seek too much bread perish miserably. He asserts his self-sufficiency.
4.  **Inaccuracy of stories:** He challenges critics to produce ""originals"" to prove his stories are false.

He concludes by stating that his stories, like all things, can be used for good or ill depending on the reader's disposition. He defends his ""unseemly"" language as natural and appropriate for the setting (gardens, not churches). He argues that his stories are for ""idle women"" to pass time, not for scholars, and that his use of ""quips and cranks"" is justified by the example of friars' sermons. He admits to writing the truth about friars, which might offend some, but says he will leave each to their own opinion. He thanks God and his readers.

He then describes the morning activities: the company arises at dawn, enjoys the garden, dines, rests, and reassembles by the fountain. Filostrato, as king, bids Fiammetta begin the day's stories, whose theme is ""unhappy endings.""

**Story 1: Tancred and Ghismonda (Fiammetta)**
Fiammetta tells of Tancred, Lord of Salerno, a humane prince who, in his old age, had one beloved daughter, Ghismonda. He delayed marrying her, and after a brief marriage, she returned a widow. Ghismonda, beautiful, young, and sprightly, secretly fell in love with Guiscardo, a low-born but noble-hearted serving-man. Their love was mutual. Ghismonda devised a secret way for them to meet: a hidden staircase from her chamber to a grotto, which had a tunnel to the outside. Guiscardo used a rope to enter. They met many times in her chamber.

One day, Tancred, visiting his daughter's chamber while she was in the garden, fell asleep on a hassock, hidden by the bed curtains. Ghismonda, unaware, entered with Guiscardo. They made love on the bed. Tancred awoke and witnessed their act. He kept silent, then left unseen, heartbroken and enraged. That night, Guiscardo was seized as he left the tunnel and brought to Tancred. Tancred, weeping, confronted Guiscardo, who simply replied, ""Love can far more than either you or I."" Guiscardo was imprisoned.

The next day, Tancred confronted Ghismonda, weeping, expressing his sorrow and shame that she had chosen a low-born man. Ghismonda, realizing her secret was out and Guiscardo was captured (and likely dead), composed herself. Undaunted, she defended her love, arguing that her natural desires, her father's delay in remarrying her, and Guiscardo's true nobility justified her actions. She scorned her father's focus on social status over true worth. She challenged him to inflict his cruelty on her, for she would not beg. She declared that whatever he did to Guiscardo, she would do to herself.

Tancred, though moved by her spirit, ordered Guiscardo to be secretly strangled and his heart brought to him. He then sent the heart to Ghismonda in a golden bowl, with a message: ""Thy father sendeth thee this, to solace thee of the thing thou most lovest, even as thou hast solaced him of that which he loved most."" Ghismonda, who had prepared a poison, received the bowl calmly. She praised her father for a ""sepulchre less of worth than one of gold"" for such a heart. She kissed the heart, thanked her father for this ""last gift,"" and lamented that she could only see it with her physical eyes, not her mind. She spoke to the heart, saying her soul would soon join his. She then poured the poisoned water over the heart, drank it all, and lay on her bed, pressing the heart to her breast, awaiting death.

Her women, alarmed, sent for Tancred. He arrived too late, finding her dying. She told him to save his tears for a less desired fate. Her last request was to be buried openly with Guiscardo's body. She died, holding the heart. Tancred, repenting his cruelty, buried them honorably in the same tomb, amidst the mourning of Salerno.

**Story 2: Fra Alberto (Pampinea)**
Pampinea tells of Fra Alberto, a wicked and hypocritical Minor Friar in Venice, who had a reputation for sanctity. He was a great preacher, often weeping during mass, but secretly a thief, pimp, forger, and murderer. He gained influence as a confessor and trustee of wills. One day, a vain and simple young lady, Madam Lisetta da Ca Quirino, confessed to him, boasting of her celestial beauty. Fra Alberto, realizing her folly, was instantly smitten and decided to seduce her.

He later visited her, claiming that the Angel Gabriel had appeared to him in a dream, chastising him for disparaging Lisetta's beauty and beating him severely. The angel, he said, loved Lisetta and wished to visit her, but would come in human form to avoid frightening her. Lisetta, believing this, was overjoyed. She agreed to receive the ""angel"" and, at Fra Alberto's suggestion, allowed him to use his body as a vessel, so his soul could go to Paradise while the angel possessed him. She only stipulated that the angel should not leave her for the Virgin Mary. She left her door open for him.

Fra Alberto, after fortifying himself with food, disguised himself as an angel and visited Lisetta. They made love, and he told her fantastical stories of heaven. Lisetta, delighted, believed she had lain with the Angel Gabriel. She later told Fra Alberto that she had given the ""angel"" a kiss under his left breast, leaving a mark. Fra Alberto continued his visits.

However, Lisetta, in a dispute with a gossip, boastfully revealed that the Angel Gabriel was her lover. The gossip spread the story throughout Venice. Lisetta's brothers-in-law, hearing this, decided to catch the ""angel."" Fra Alberto, getting wind of the trap, fled Lisetta's chamber by jumping into the Grand Canal. He swam to the other side and sought refuge with a poor man, telling him a fabricated story. The poor man, needing to go out, hid Fra Alberto in his bed.

The brothers-in-law, finding the ""angel's wings"" (his disguise) but no angel, were furious. The poor man, returning from the Rialto, heard the rumors of the angel's escape and realized Fra Alberto was the culprit. He extorted 50 ducats from Fra Alberto. He then suggested a plan for escape: on a festival day, he would disguise Fra Alberto as a ""wild man of the woods"" for a public hunt in St. Mark's Square. Fra Alberto, terrified, agreed. The man smeared him with honey, covered him with down, chained him, and put a mask on him. He then proclaimed that the Angel Gabriel would be shown.

In St. Mark's Square, the man unmasked Fra Alberto, revealing him to the jeering crowd. Fra Alberto was recognized, cursed, and pelted with filth. His brethren rescued him and took him to the convent, where he died in prison. Pampinea concludes that Fra Alberto, who feigned sanctity, was publicly shamed for his wickedness.

**Story 3: Three Young Men and Three Sisters (Lauretta)**
Lauretta tells of three sisters in Marseilles: Ninetta, Maddalena, and Bertella. Ninetta loved Restagnone, a poor gentleman, and they had a secret affair. Two rich young men, Folco and Ughetto, fell in love with Maddalena and Bertella, respectively. Restagnone, seeing an opportunity, proposed to Folco and Ughetto that they pool their wealth, make him a third partner, and flee to Crete with the three sisters. The young men, inflamed by love, agreed. Ninetta convinced her sisters. They stole money and jewels from their father and embarked on a brigantine for Crete. They bought estates near Candia and lived lavishly.

However, Restagnone, sated by Ninetta's constant availability, grew weary of her. He fell in love with a local noblewoman. Ninetta, consumed by jealousy, reproached him, but this only fueled his new passion. Blinded by rage, Ninetta sought revenge. She obtained a deadly poison from an old Greek woman and gave it to Restagnone, who died that night. The others mourned him, unaware of the poison.

Later, the old woman was arrested for another crime and confessed to compounding the poison for Ninetta. The Duke of Crete, learning this, secretly arrested Ninetta, who confessed. Folco and Ughetto tried to save her from being burned, but the Duke was resolute. Maddalena, who the Duke had long courted, offered herself to him in exchange for Ninetta's life and secrecy. The Duke agreed. He feigned to put Ninetta in a sack and sink her at sea, then brought her to Maddalena. The next morning, he released Ninetta to Maddalena, warning her to send Ninetta away.

Folco and Ughetto, believing Ninetta drowned, were released. Folco soon discovered Ninetta hidden in the palace. Maddalena, forced to confess the truth, enraged Folco, who drew his sword and killed her. Fearing the Duke's wrath, he fled with Ninetta, taking what little money he could. They embarked on a vessel and disappeared. Maddalena's murder was discovered, and Ughetto and Bertella were accused. They bribed their captors and fled to Rhodes, where they lived and died in poverty.

**Story 4: Gerbino (Elisa)**
Elisa tells of Gerbino, grandson of King Guglielmo II of Sicily, renowned for his prowess. His fame reached the daughter of the King of Tunis, a beautiful and noble princess, who fell in love with him by hearsay. Gerbino, hearing of her beauty, also fell in love. They exchanged messages and gifts, planning to meet.

The King of Tunis, however, betrothed his daughter to the King of Granada. The princess sent a message to Gerbino, challenging him to prove his valor. Gerbino, knowing his grandfather had pledged safe passage to the King of Tunis, was conflicted but, driven by love, armed two galleys and sailed to Sardinia to intercept the princess's ship. He found her ship becalmed. He rallied his men, promising them all the riches if he could have the princess.

He hailed the ship, demanding the princess. The Saracens, showing King Guglielmo's glove as a sign of safe passage, refused. Gerbino, seeing the princess on deck, was further inflamed. He replied that ""there were no falcons there at that present and consequently there needed no gloves,"" and attacked. After a fierce battle, Gerbino set fire to the ship. The Saracens, seeing no escape, brought the princess on deck and, before Gerbino's eyes, butchered her and threw her into the sea, saying, ""Take her; we give her to thee, such as we may and such as thine unfaith hath merited.""

Gerbino, enraged, boarded the burning ship, slew many Saracens, and rescued what goods he could. He then retrieved the princess's body from the sea, wept over it, and buried it honorably on the island of Ustica. He returned home, a broken man. The King of Tunis complained to King Guglielmo, who, unable to deny the breach of faith, condemned Gerbino to death. Despite pleas from his barons, King Guglielmo had Gerbino beheaded, choosing to uphold his word over his lineage. Thus, both lovers died miserably without having enjoyed their love.

**Story 5: Lisabetta (Filomena)**
Filomena tells of three wealthy merchant brothers in Messina and their beautiful sister, Lisabetta. Lisabetta fell in love with Lorenzo, a handsome young Pisan who managed their affairs. Their love was mutual and secret. One night, the eldest brother saw Lisabetta going to Lorenzo's bed. He told his brothers, and they decided to silently eliminate Lorenzo to avoid scandal. They feigned a pleasure trip, took Lorenzo to a lonely place, murdered him, and buried him. They told Lisabetta he had been sent away on business.

Lisabetta, distraught by Lorenzo's prolonged absence, repeatedly questioned her brothers. One day, one brother angrily told her to stop asking. Lisabetta, sad and fearful, ceased questioning but continued to mourn. One night, Lorenzo appeared to her in a dream, pale and disheveled, revealing that her brothers had murdered him and showing her his burial place. She awoke, weeping, believing the dream.

The next morning, she obtained permission to go outside the city for recreation. With her maid, she went to the spot from her dream, dug, and found Lorenzo's body, still uncorrupted. Unable to move the whole body, she cut off his head, wrapped it in a napkin, and carried it home in her maid's lap. She then buried the head in a pot of basil, which she watered daily with her tears, rose water, and orange-flower water. She sat by the pot, gazing at it amorously, weeping profusely. The basil flourished, growing fair and sweet-scented from the decaying head.

Neighbors noticed her constant mourning over the pot and told her brothers. They, having already reproached her in vain, secretly took the pot away. Lisabetta, frantic, demanded its return and wept incessantly until she fell ill. In her sickness, she only asked for the basil pot. Her brothers, suspicious, emptied the pot and found Lorenzo's head. Terrified of discovery, they buried the head and secretly fled Messina for Naples. Lisabetta, never ceasing her lamentations, died weeping. Her ill-fated love thus ended. The story became a famous song.

**Story 6: Andrevuola (Pamfilo)**
Pamfilo tells of Andrevuola, a noble and beautiful young woman in Brescia, who secretly married Gabriotto, a handsome but low-born man. They often met in her father's garden. One night, Andrevuola dreamt she was with Gabriotto in the garden, but a dark, frightful thing emerged from his body, tore him from her, and carried him underground. She awoke, relieved it was a dream, but fearful. Gabriotto, however, scoffed at dreams, recounting his own dream of a black greyhound tearing out his heart. He dismissed both dreams as meaningless.

Later that night, as they sat by a fountain in the garden, Gabriotto suddenly sighed, embraced her, and cried, ""Alas, my soul, help me, for I die!"" He fell to the ground and died, his body swelling and discoloring. Andrevuola, distraught, wept over him. Her maid, privy to their love, came. Andrevuola, determined to preserve her honor and bury Gabriotto, refused to kill herself. She decided to lay his body before his own house. She dressed him in a silk cloth, covered him with roses, and placed her wedding ring on his finger. She and her maid carried him out of the garden.

As they carried the body, they were intercepted by the Provost's officers. Andrevuola, recognizing them, declared her innocence and willingness to explain. Physicians confirmed Gabriotto died of a burst internal imposthume, not violence. The Provost, seeing her beauty, tried to force her to his will in exchange for her freedom. Andrevuola, indignant, fiercely defended herself. Meanwhile, her father, Messer Negro, arrived at the palace, demanding his daughter. The Provost, to avoid being accused of violence, praised Andrevuola's constancy and offered to marry her himself. Andrevuola, throwing herself at her father's feet, confessed her secret marriage to Gabriotto and begged forgiveness.

Messer Negro, a kind man, wept and forgave her, lamenting that he had not known Gabriotto while he lived. He ordered a grand funeral for Gabriotto. The young man's kinsmen arrived, and the body, laid out on Andrevuola's silk cloth and covered with roses, was publicly mourned. It was honorably buried. The Provost, still desiring her, proposed marriage again, but Andrevuola, with her father's consent, became a nun in a convent, living honorably.

**Story 7: Simona (Emilia)**
Emilia tells of Simona, a poor but beautiful Florentine girl who spun wool. She fell in love with Pasquino, a young wool-monger's employee. Their love was mutual and they often met. One day, Pasquino invited Simona to a garden for a secret rendezvous. She went with her friend Lagina, meeting Pasquino and his friend Stramba. While Stramba and Lagina paired off, Simona and Pasquino sat by a sage bush. Pasquino plucked a sage leaf and rubbed it on his teeth, saying it cleaned them. Soon after, he changed countenance, lost speech, and died, his face and body swelling and darkening.

Simona, weeping, called Stramba and Lagina. Stramba, seeing Pasquino's swollen body, immediately accused Simona of poisoning him. Neighbors, hearing the commotion, also concluded she was guilty. Simona was taken to the Provost's palace. The judge, finding no evidence of malice, decided to inspect the body and the scene. At the garden, Simona recounted the events. To demonstrate, she rubbed a sage leaf on her own teeth. She immediately suffered the same fate as Pasquino, dying on the spot.

The judge and bystanders were astonished. They concluded the sage was poisonous. The garden keeper cut down the bush, revealing a ""toad of marvellous bigness"" underneath, whose ""pestiferous breath"" had made the sage venomous. The toad was burned. Pasquino and Simona, both swollen, were buried together in the church of St. Paul. The story became a song.

**Story 8: Girolamo (Neifile)**
Neifile tells of Girolamo, son of a rich Florentine merchant, Lionardo Sighieri. Girolamo grew up loving Salvestra, the daughter of a tailor. His mother, fearing he would marry beneath his station, persuaded his guardians to send him to Paris for two years. Girolamo, deeply in love, reluctantly agreed. He was kept in Paris for two years, returning more in love than ever, only to find Salvestra married to an honest tent-maker.

Girolamo was heartbroken. He tried to rekindle her memory by passing by her house, but she seemed to have forgotten him. Desperate, he resolved to speak with her. One evening, while Salvestra and her husband were out, he secretly entered their house and hid among tent cloths. When they returned and her husband fell asleep, Girolamo approached her bed and softly called her name. Salvestra, awake, was terrified and begged him to leave, reminding him she was married and desired peace with her husband.

Girolamo pleaded, recalling their past love, but she remained firm. As a last request, he asked to lie beside her to warm himself, promising not to touch her. She, taking pity, agreed. Girolamo lay beside her and, overwhelmed by his lost hope and her cruelty, ""straitening in himself his vital spirits,"" died without a sound. Salvestra, after a while, tried to wake him, finding him cold as ice. Realizing he was dead, she was distraught. She woke her husband, fabricating a story about a stranger dying in her bed, and asked for his advice. He advised her to quietly carry the body to its own house. Salvestra then made him touch Girolamo's body.

Her husband, confounded, dressed Girolamo's body and carried it to his house, leaving it at the door. In the morning, Girolamo's death was discovered. His mother and kinsfolk mourned. Physicians found no wounds, concluding he died of grief. The body was taken to a church. Salvestra, now overcome with pity and regret, went to the church. Seeing his dead face, her old love rekindled. She shrieked, threw herself on his body, and died of grief. The cause of both their deaths became known. They were buried together in the same tomb, united in death as they could not be in life.

**Story 9: Sir Guillaume de Roussillon (Lauretta)**
Lauretta tells of two noble Provençal knights, Sir Guillaume de Roussillon and Sir Guillaume de Guardestaing, who were close friends. Roussillon's wife, a beautiful lady, fell in love with Guardestaing, and he with her. They became lovers, but their indiscretion was discovered by Roussillon. His love for Guardestaing turned to mortal hatred, but he concealed it, resolving to kill him.

Roussillon invited Guardestaing to supper, ostensibly to discuss a tournament. Guardestaing, unsuspecting, arrived unarmed. Roussillon ambushed him in a wood, crying ""Traitor, thou art dead!"" and killed him with a lance. He then dismounted, tore out Guardestaing's heart, wrapped it in a lance pennon, and sent it to his cook, ordering him to prepare a delicious dish from it for supper.

At dinner, Roussillon's wife, wondering why Guardestaing hadn't arrived, was told he would come tomorrow. The cook served the heart as a ragout. The lady, finding it delicious, ate it all. Roussillon then revealed that she had eaten the heart of Sir Guillaume de Guardestaing, whom she loved. The lady was horrified. She condemned Roussillon's baseness, declaring that no other food should follow such a noble meal. She then threw herself backward from a high window, dying instantly.

Roussillon, dismayed, fled. The next day, the bodies were found. Guardestaing's people and the lady's kinsfolk buried them together in the same sepulchre, with verses recounting their tragic story.

**Story 10: A Physician's Wife (Dioneo)**
Dioneo tells of Master Mazzeo della Montagna, an elderly, famous surgeon in Salerno, who married a beautiful young woman. He was neglectful in bed, claiming marital relations required long recovery. His wife, unhappy, took a lover, Ruggieri da Jeroli, a noble but disreputable young man. She helped him financially, hoping to reform him.

One day, the doctor prepared a powerful sleeping draught for a patient. He left it in his chamber. His wife, knowing he would be away, invited Ruggieri. Ruggieri, thirsty, drank the draught, thinking it was water, and fell into a deep, death-like sleep. The wife, finding him unresponsive, believed him dead. Fearing scandal, she called her maid. The maid suggested they put him in a chest outside a neighbor's carpenter shop, hoping he would be mistaken for a victim of a street brawl. The wife refused to wound him but agreed to the chest.

Two usurers, needing furniture, stole the chest that night, believing it empty, and took it to their house. Ruggieri awoke in the chest, confused. He accidentally overturned it, escaping. The usurers' wives, hearing the noise, cried ""Thieves!"" Neighbors and officers arrived, catching Ruggieri. He confessed to being a thief (to explain his presence), and the governor prepared to hang him.

The news spread. The wife and maid were distraught. The doctor returned, discovered his sleeping draught missing, and realized Ruggieri had drunk it. The maid, instructed by her mistress, confessed to the doctor that she had brought Ruggieri into the house, given him the water (unknowingly drugged), and put him in the chest. The doctor, amused, forgave her. The maid then went to the magistrate, repeating her story, adding details about the carpenter and usurers, explaining how Ruggieri ended up in the chest. The magistrate, confirming the story with the doctor, carpenter, and usurers, released Ruggieri and fined the usurers for theft. Ruggieri was overjoyed, and his mistress continued their affair, laughing at the whole incident.

**Conclusion of Day the Fourth**
The ladies laughed heartily at Dioneo's story, recovering from the melancholy of the previous tales. Filostrato, his reign ended, crowned Fiammetta as queen, asking her to console the company with joyous stories. Fiammetta, with her golden hair and radiant face, accepted and set the theme for the fifth day: ""OF THAT WHICH HATH HAPPILY BETIDED LOVERS AFTER SUNDRY CRUEL AND MISFORTUNATE ADVENTURES."" After consulting the seneschal, she dismissed the company. They enjoyed the garden, some by the mills, until supper. After supper, Filomena led a dance, and Fiammetta commanded Filostrato to sing a song. He sang a plaintive song about betrayed love and lost faith, revealing his own unhappiness. The company then retired to bed.

**Day the Fifth**

**Introduction**
At dawn, Fiammetta and her company arose, walked in the dewy fields, and enjoyed birdsong. As the sun grew hot, they returned to the palace, refreshed themselves, and spent time in the garden. After dinner and a siesta, they reassembled by the fountain. Fiammetta, as queen, asked Pamfilo to begin the ""fair-fortuned stories.""

**Story 1: Cimon (Pamfilo)**
Pamfilo tells of Aristippus, a noble and rich gentleman in Cyprus, whose son, Galesus, was a dullard, nicknamed Cimon (brute beast). Aristippus sent Cimon to a country house. One day, Cimon found a beautiful maiden, Iphigenia, asleep by a spring. He was instantly captivated. This sight awakened his intelligence and refined his manners. He returned to his father, demanding fine clothes and education. Driven by love for Iphigenia, he quickly became a skilled philosopher, musician, and warrior, transforming from a ""dunce into a man.""

Cimon, now a distinguished gentleman, sought Iphigenia's hand, but her father, Cipseus, had promised her to Pasimondas, a nobleman from Rhodes. When the wedding day approached, Cimon resolved to have her or die. He secretly equipped a ship and intercepted Iphigenia's vessel at sea. He boarded the ship, fighting fiercely, and captured Iphigenia, letting the Rhodians go. He comforted Iphigenia, telling her he, Cimon, had won her through love, not Pasimondas by promise.

Cimon and his companions sailed for Crete, where they had kinsmen. However, a violent storm struck. Iphigenia cursed Cimon's love, believing the gods were punishing his presumption. The storm drove them to Rhodes, near where the other Rhodian ship had taken shelter. They were recognized by the Rhodian sailors, who alerted Pasimondas. Cimon and his men were captured and imprisoned. Pasimondas sought their execution, but their lives were spared in return for Cimon's earlier release of the Rhodian sailors.

Meanwhile, Pasimondas's brother, Ormisdas, was to marry Cassandra, whom Lysimachus (the chief magistrate of Rhodes) loved. Lysimachus, desperate, decided to abduct Cassandra. He realized Cimon, a fellow lover, would be his best ally. He secretly met Cimon in prison, proposing they abduct their respective mistresses on the wedding day. Cimon eagerly agreed.

On the wedding day, while the festivities were in full swing, Lysimachus, Cimon, and their armed companions stormed Pasimondas's house. They seized Iphigenia and Cassandra, killing Pasimondas and Ormisdas in the ensuing chaos. They fled to their ship and sailed to Crete, where they were welcomed. Cimon married Iphigenia, and Lysimachus married Cassandra. After some exile, their friends reconciled them with their families, and they returned home, living long and happily.

**Story 2: Costanza (Emilia)**
Emilia tells of Costanza, a beautiful maiden from Lipari, who loved Martuccio Gomito, a worthy young man. Her father refused their marriage due to Martuccio's poverty. Martuccio, vowing to return rich, became a corsair. He prospered but, seeking too much, was captured by Saracens and imprisoned in Tunis. News reached Lipari that he and his crew had drowned.

Costanza, heartbroken, resolved to die. Unable to commit suicide directly, she secretly boarded a small, unattended fishing boat and set it adrift, hoping it would sink or crash. Instead, a gentle wind carried her to Susa in Barbary. A poor woman, Carapresa, found her and, taking pity, brought her to her hut. Costanza, hearing Carapresa was from Trapani, felt a flicker of hope. She was taken to a good Saracen lady, where she learned the local language and worked.

Meanwhile, Martuccio, in prison, learned of a war between the King of Tunis and a Granadan prince. He offered the King strategic advice: to use thinner bowstrings and arrows with narrow notches. This would allow the King's archers to use both their own and the enemy's arrows (whose notches would be wide enough), while the enemy could only use their own. The King followed his advice and won the war, making Martuccio a favorite and wealthy.

Costanza, hearing of Martuccio's success, felt her love rekindle. She revealed her story to the old lady, who took her to Tunis. Carapresa confirmed Martuccio's status. The old lady then informed Martuccio that a servant from Lipari wished to speak with him. Martuccio went to her house, where Costanza, overcome with joy, embraced him. They recounted their adventures. Martuccio obtained the King's permission to marry Costanza. The King, impressed, gave them magnificent gifts. Martuccio, after thanking the old lady, returned with Costanza and Carapresa to Lipari, where they married and lived happily.

**Story 3: Pietro Boccamazza (Elisa)**
Elisa tells of Pietro Boccamazza, a noble Roman youth, who loved Agnolella, a beautiful plebeian girl. His family opposed the match. Pietro, unable to marry her, persuaded Agnolella to elope with him to Anagni. They rode off, kissing and talking of love. About eight miles from Rome, they took a wrong turn into a wood. Suddenly, twelve footmen appeared from a nearby castle. Agnolella, seeing them, spurred her horse into the wood. Pietro, distracted, was captured.

The footmen, enemies of Pietro's family (the Orsini), decided to hang him. As they forced him to undress, twenty-five more footmen ambushed them. In the ensuing fight, Pietro grabbed his clothes and horse and fled into the wood, following Agnolella's path. He searched for her, weeping and calling, but found no trace. Fearing wild beasts, he tied his horse to an oak and climbed the tree to spend the night, cursing his bad luck.

Agnolella, lost in the wood, eventually found a small path leading to a hut. An old couple warned her of dangerous men in the area. She stayed, but at dawn, hearing men approaching, she hid in a hay heap in the courtyard. A band of rogues (the ones who had captured Pietro) entered, found her horse, and claimed it. One of them, throwing his lance into the hay, narrowly missed her, but she remained silent. After eating and drinking, the rogues left. The old couple, finding Agnolella, took her to a nearby castle belonging to Lionello di Campodifiore, whose wife, a kind lady, recognized Agnolella and Pietro (as a friend of her husband's). She offered Agnolella shelter, believing Pietro to be dead.

Meanwhile, Pietro, still in the oak, saw wolves devour his horse. At daybreak, freezing, he saw a fire and found shepherds, who gave him food and warmth. He told them his story. They directed him to Lionello's castle. There, he found Agnolella. Their reunion was joyful. The lady of the castle, though initially scolding Pietro for his elopement, saw their genuine love and decided to help. She married them in her castle and promised to reconcile them with their families. After enjoying their love, they returned to Rome, where the lady helped them make peace with Pietro's family. They lived happily to old age.

**Story 4: Ricciardo Manardi (Filostrato)**
Filostrato tells of Messer Lizio da Valbona, a worthy gentleman in Romagna, who had a beautiful and agreeable daughter, Caterina, late in his old age. He and his wife, Madam Giacomina, guarded her diligently. Ricciardo Manardi, a handsome young man, often visited Messer Lizio's house and fell in love with Caterina, who returned his affection. They secretly confessed their love. Ricciardo proposed they meet in the gallery adjoining Caterina's father's garden. Caterina agreed.

To achieve this, Caterina complained to her mother about the heat, suggesting she sleep in the gallery to hear the nightingale. Her father initially scoffed, saying she'd sleep to the ""chirp of the crickets."" But after another sleepless night for Caterina, her mother persuaded him. A bed was made in the gallery. That night, Messer Lizio locked the door to the gallery from his chamber. Ricciardo, using a ladder and handholds, climbed to the gallery, where Caterina joyfully received him. They made love throughout the night, making the ""nightingale sing many a time.""

As dawn approached, they fell asleep, naked and embraced, Caterina holding Ricciardo by his genitals. Messer Lizio awoke, curious to see how the nightingale had made Caterina sleep. He quietly opened the door to the gallery, drew back the curtain, and saw them. Recognizing Ricciardo, he went to his wife, telling her to come see how their daughter had caught the nightingale. Madam Giacomina, initially shocked, wanted to scold them, but Messer Lizio, calm, decided to turn the scandal into an honorable marriage. Ricciardo was young, rich, and well-born, and would make a good son-in-law.

Ricciardo awoke, terrified to be discovered. Messer Lizio, lifting the curtain, said, ""We shall do well."" Ricciardo begged for mercy. Messer Lizio offered him a choice: marry Caterina or die. Caterina, weeping, also urged him to marry her. Ricciardo, eager to escape death and possess his beloved, readily agreed. Messer Lizio, using his wife's ring, married them on the spot. The parents left them to rest. They continued their lovemaking. A few days later, they were formally married, and Ricciardo took Caterina home, where they lived happily, ""nightingale-fowling"" to their hearts' content.

**Story 5: Giannole di Severino and Minghino di Mingole (Neifile)**
Neifile tells of Guidotto da Cremona, an old Lombard soldier in Fano, who on his deathbed entrusted his ten-year-old daughter to his friend Giacomino da Pavia, along with all his wealth. Giacomino moved to Faenza with the girl, whom he loved as his own. She grew into a beautiful and virtuous fifteen-year-old. Two agreeable young men, Giannole di Severino and Minghino di Mingole, fell in love with her, becoming rivals. Their families would not permit marriage due to her unknown origins.

Giannole bribed Crivello, Giacomino's servant, to let him into the house when Giacomino was out. Minghino bribed the maidservant with a similar promise. One evening, Giacomino went to supper. Crivello signaled Giannole, and the maid signaled Minghino. Both lovers arrived with armed companions, unaware of each other. Giannole entered first and tried to abduct the girl. She and the maid screamed. Minghino, hearing the commotion, rushed in with his men. A fight ensued. Neighbors intervened, and Minghino rescued the girl, returning her to Giacomino's house. Many were arrested, including Giannole, Minghino, and Crivello.

Giacomino, returning home, was upset but, finding the girl blameless, decided to marry her quickly. The kinsmen of the imprisoned youths pleaded with Giacomino. He revealed that the girl was not from Cremona or Pavia, but a Faentine, though her parentage was unknown. He recounted Guidotto's deathbed confession: he had found the two-year-old girl in a plundered house in Faenza during Emperor Frederick's capture of the city.

Guiglielmino da Medicina, present, recognized the story and identified the plundered house as Bernabuccio's. Bernabuccio, also present, remembered losing a young daughter during the sack of Faenza and a cross-shaped scar over her left ear. He asked to see the girl. Giacomino agreed. Bernabuccio saw her resemblance to her mother and found the scar, confirming she was his daughter. He embraced her, and she, sensing a connection, wept with him. Bernabuccio sent for his wife and family, and the reunion was joyous. The town-captain, learning Giannole was Bernabuccio's son and thus the girl's brother, released him, Minghino, and Crivello. He then arranged the marriage of Agnesa (the girl's true name) to Minghino. Minghino and Agnesa lived happily.

**Story 6: Gianni di Procida (Pampinea)**
Pampinea tells of Gianni di Procida, a youth from the island of Procida, who loved Restituta, daughter of Marino Bolgaro of Ischia. She loved him equally. Gianni often swam from Procida to Ischia to see her. One summer day, Restituta, alone on the seashore, was abducted by Sicilian corsairs and taken to Calabria. Unable to agree on who should have her, they presented her to King Frederick of Sicily, who was young and enjoyed such gifts. He ordered her lodged in a beautiful pavilion in his garden, La Cuba, until he recovered from an illness.

Gianni, hearing of her abduction and the direction the corsairs took, sailed to Palermo. He discovered she was with the King at La Cuba. Despairing, he sent his pinnace away and stayed in Palermo. He saw Restituta at a window, and she saw him. She instructed him on how to enter the garden. That night, Gianni climbed into the garden and then into her chamber through an open window. Restituta, believing her honor already compromised and seeing Gianni as her only hope, decided to yield to him and asked him to take her away. Gianni agreed, promising to arrange their escape. They made love and fell asleep in each other's arms.

The King, recovered and desiring Restituta, went to La Cuba with servants. He entered her chamber and found them naked and asleep together. Enraged, he almost killed them but decided on a public execution by fire. He ordered them bound and taken to Palermo's public square to be burned at tierce (9 a.m.). The townspeople flocked to see them. The wretched lovers, ashamed and fearing death, awaited their fate.

Ruggieri dell' Oria, the King's admiral, heard the news. He recognized Gianni di Procida and asked him what had happened. Gianni confessed his love and the King's anger. Gianni then begged Ruggieri to turn them face-to-face so he could die looking at his beloved. Ruggieri, laughing, promised he would see her until he grew weary. Ruggieri then went to the King, arguing that the lovers' offense, born of love, did not deserve death, especially since Gianni's uncle, Messer Gian di Procida, was instrumental in making Frederick King of Sicily, and Restituta's father was also influential. He reminded the King of the good deeds of their families.

The King, realizing the truth and regretting his rashness, ordered their release. He clothed them sumptuously, married them, and gave them magnificent presents. They returned to Ischia, where they were received with great joy.

**Story 7: Teodoro (Lauretta)**
Lauretta tells of Messer Amerigo Abate of Trapani, who bought several boys, believing them Turks, from Genoese corsairs. Among them was Teodoro, a noble-looking boy. Amerigo freed him, baptized him Pietro, and made him chief of his affairs. Pietro fell in love with Amerigo's daughter, Violante, who returned his love. They secretly met in a ruined hut at Amerigo's country estate. Violante became pregnant. Pietro, fearing for his life, wanted to flee, but Violante convinced him to stay, promising to protect him.

Violante, unable to hide her pregnancy, confessed to her mother, fabricating a story to protect Pietro. Her mother sent her to the country house. One day, Amerigo, returning from hawking, unexpectedly found Violante giving birth. Enraged, he demanded to know the father. Violante, fearing death, revealed Pietro. Amerigo, furious, reported Pietro to Messer Currado, the King's captain. Pietro was tortured and confessed. He was condemned to be flogged through the city and then hanged. Amerigo, still enraged, sent a servant to Violante with a poisoned cup and a dagger, ordering her to choose her death, or be burned alive. He also ordered the servant to kill the newborn child.

As Pietro was being scourged through the city, three Armenian noblemen, ambassadors to Rome, saw him. One, Fineo, recognized a birthmark on Pietro's chest, a ""vermeil spot... after the fashion of what women here call roses."" He realized Pietro was his son Teodoro, abducted fifteen years prior. Fineo called out, and Pietro, hearing his true name, confirmed his identity and parentage. Fineo, weeping, embraced him, clothed him in his own rich mantle, and asked the officer to delay the execution.

Fineo then went to Messer Currado, revealing Pietro's true identity and noble birth, and stating that Pietro was willing to marry Violante. Currado, ashamed of the injustice, released Pietro. He then informed Amerigo, who, believing his daughter and grandson dead, was distraught. He sent a messenger to stop his orders. The messenger arrived just as Violante was about to choose between poison and dagger. He stopped the servant. Amerigo, relieved, agreed to the marriage. Teodoro and Violante were married with great magnificence. Violante recovered and became more beautiful. Fineo, taking his son, daughter-in-law, and grandson, returned to Lazistan, where they lived happily.

**Story 8: Nastagio degli Onesti (Filomena)**
Filomena tells of Nastagio degli Onesti, a wealthy young man in Ravenna, who loved a proud and cruel lady of the Traversari family. His lavish efforts to win her love were in vain. His friends advised him to leave Ravenna to forget her and curb his spending. He reluctantly agreed, moving to Chiassi, three miles away, where he continued to live magnificently.

One day in May, lost in thought about his cruel mistress, he wandered into a pine wood. He heard terrible w wailing and saw a beautiful naked damsel running through thorns, pursued by two fierce mastiffs and a knight in black armor, who threatened her with death. Nastagio, terrified but moved by compassion, tried to intervene. The knight revealed himself as Messer Guido degli Anastagi, a fellow Ravennese, who had loved the damsel (who was the lady Nastagio loved) in his lifetime. She had been cruel to him, and he had killed himself in despair. She, rejoicing in his death, also died. For her cruelty and his suicide, they were both condemned to a hellish penance: he must eternally pursue and kill her every Friday in that wood, tear out her heart and entrails, and feed them to the dogs, after which she would rise again to flee. This punishment would continue for as many years as she had been cruel to him months.

Nastagio, horrified, retreated. He realized this vision could serve his purpose. He marked the spot and invited his kinsmen, Messer Paolo Traversari, his wife, and his daughter (Nastagio's beloved) to a magnificent dinner in that very pine wood the following Friday. As the last dish was served, the ghostly chase began. The lady, the knight, and the dogs appeared, reenacting the gruesome scene. The ladies present, many of whom were kinswomen of the ghostly damsel, wept.

Nastagio's cruel mistress, witnessing this, was terrified. She realized the vision was a warning for her own cruelty towards Nastagio. Fearing a similar fate, she immediately sent her chamberwoman to Nastagio, offering her love. Nastagio replied he would only accept her as his wife. She agreed, and her parents, overjoyed, arranged the marriage. Nastagio and his lady married the next Sunday and lived long and happily. This terrifying event also made all the ladies of Ravenna more amenable to their lovers' desires.

**Story 9: Federigo degli Alberighi (Fiammetta)**
Fiammetta tells of Federigo degli Alberighi, a noble Florentine renowned for arms and courtesy, who fell in love with Madam Giovanna, a virtuous and beautiful lady. To win her love, he squandered all his wealth on jousts, entertainments, and gifts. She, however, remained indifferent. Federigo became poor, with only a small farm and his prized falcon, one of the best in the world. He moved to his farm, living meagerly, hunting with his falcon.

Madam Giovanna's husband fell ill and died, leaving his son as heir, with Giovanna as his substitute if the son died without issue. Giovanna moved to a country estate near Federigo's. Her son befriended Federigo and became fascinated by his falcon, longing to own it. The boy fell ill, and his mother, desperate, promised him anything to make him well. He asked for Federigo's falcon.

Giovanna was conflicted. She knew Federigo's love for her and that the falcon was his last possession. She felt it ungracious to ask for it. But her son's love compelled her. She promised to get the falcon. The next morning, she visited Federigo with another lady, ostensibly for a friendly dinner. Federigo, overjoyed but ashamed of his poverty, welcomed her. He realized he had nothing worthy to serve such a noble guest. His eyes fell on his falcon. Having no other resource, he wrung its neck and had his maid roast it diligently.

At dinner, Federigo served the falcon, and the ladies ate it, unaware. After dinner, Giovanna revealed her purpose, explaining her son's illness and his desire for the falcon. She begged Federigo to give it to her, appealing to his nobility. Federigo, weeping, confessed he could not grant her request because he had just served her the falcon for dinner. He showed her the feathers, feet, and beak as proof.

Giovanna first blamed him for killing such a falcon for a meal but then greatly admired his magnanimity, which poverty could not diminish. She returned to her son, distraught. Soon after, her son died. After a period of mourning, her brothers urged her to remarry. She, recalling Federigo's worth and his ultimate sacrifice, declared she would marry no one but him, saying, ""I would liefer have a man that lacketh of riches than riches that lack of a man."" Her brothers, though initially mocking, agreed. Federigo married Giovanna, becoming rich again, and lived happily, managing his wealth more wisely.

**Story 10: Pietro di Vinciolo (Dioneo)**
Dioneo tells of Pietro di Vinciolo, a rich man in Perugia, who married the beautiful and lusty Peronella, more to conceal his own homosexual inclinations than from desire for her. Peronella, realizing his neglect, decided to take a lover. She found an old woman, a fake saint, who encouraged her, saying women should enjoy their youth. The old woman helped Peronella find lovers.

One evening, Pietro was to sup with a friend, Ercolano. Peronella invited a handsome young man. As they sat down to supper, Pietro unexpectedly returned. Peronella quickly hid her lover under a hen-coop in an adjoining shed, covering him with sacking. She then opened the door to Pietro, feigning anger at his early return and accusing him of neglecting her. Pietro explained that it was a holiday (San Galeone's Feast) and he had found no work. He then told her he had sold an old vat that cluttered the house for five florins.

Peronella, quick-witted, claimed she had already sold the vat for seven florins to a man who was currently inside, checking its soundness. Pietro was delighted. The lover, Giannello Strignario, hearing this, emerged from the vat, pretending to have just finished his inspection. He complained the vat was dirty and needed scraping. Pietro, eager to finalize the sale, agreed to clean it himself. While Pietro was inside the vat, scraping, Peronella, leaning into the vat's mouth to direct him, allowed Giannello to make love to her.

Meanwhile, Pietro recounted to his wife how Ercolano had discovered his wife's lover hidden in a cupboard due to sneezing from sulphur fumes. Peronella, feigning outrage at Ercolano's wife's infidelity, condemned such women to be burned. Just then, an ass belonging to Pietro's farm, having escaped its stable, stepped on Giannello's fingers, causing him to cry out. Pietro, hearing the noise, discovered Giannello under the hen-coop.

Pietro, enraged, confronted his wife, accusing her of hypocrisy. Peronella, seeing he had not physically harmed her, boldly defended herself, arguing that his neglect drove her to seek satisfaction elsewhere. She reminded him of his own preferences and that she was a woman with desires. Pietro, realizing he couldn't win an argument, and perhaps secretly pleased by the young man's presence, agreed to a truce. He asked them to sup. After supper, Pietro made an arrangement with his wife, implying he would share her lover. The next morning, Giannello was escorted away, leaving Pietro to live in a strange arrangement with his wife.

**Conclusion of Day the Fifth**
Dioneo's story, though deemed unseemly by some ladies, provoked much laughter, relieving the melancholy of the previous tales. Lauretta, her reign ended, crowned Emilia as queen, praising her beauty and urging her to match it with her actions. Emilia, blushing, accepted. She declared that for the next day, they would have no fixed theme, allowing everyone to discourse as they pleased, like oxen released from the yoke to graze freely. This was commended by all. They then enjoyed their usual evening activities. Pamfilo sang a song about the joy of secret love, which hinted at his own hidden passion. The king then dismissed them to rest.

**Day the Sixth**

**Introduction**
At dawn, the company walked in the dewy grass, discussing the previous day's stories. As the sun grew hot, they returned to the palace for breakfast and then sang and danced. After their rest, they reassembled by the fountain. As Queen Elisa was about to call for the first story, a loud clamor erupted from the kitchen. The seneschal reported an argument between Licisca and Tindaro. Elisa summoned them. Licisca, an older, boisterous woman, spoke first, complaining that Tindaro, a young man, dared to tell her that Sicofante's wife (a neighbor) had lost her virginity violently on her wedding night. Licisca vehemently denied this, claiming the wife had accepted her husband ""in peace and to the great contentment of those within."" She then launched into a tirade about women's sexual experiences, claiming she knew no woman who was a virgin on her wedding night and that wives always trick their husbands.

The ladies laughed uncontrollably. Elisa tried to silence Licisca, but she continued until she had finished. Elisa then turned to Dioneo, saying this matter was for his jurisdiction. Dioneo immediately ruled in Licisca's favor, declaring Tindaro an ass. Licisca, triumphant, continued to boast until Elisa, angrily, silenced her and sent her and Tindaro away. Elisa then called on Filomena to begin the day's stories.

**Story 1: Madam Oretta (Filomena)**
Filomena tells of Madam Oretta, a noble, well-bred, and well-spoken Florentine lady, wife of Messer Geri Spina. One day, while she was walking with a company of ladies and gentlemen in the countryside, one gentleman offered to ""carry her a-horseback"" a great part of the way with one of the finest stories in the world. Madam Oretta gladly accepted. The gentleman began a good story, but he told it so poorly, repeating words, correcting himself, and confusing names, that he ruined it. Madam Oretta, feeling sick from the tedious narration, finally interrupted him pleasantly, saying, ""Sir, this horse of yours hath too hard a trot; wherefore I pray you be pleased to set me down."" The gentleman, understanding her witty rebuke, laughed, changed the subject, and left the story unfinished.

**Story 2: Cisti the Baker (Pampinea)**
Pampinea tells of Cisti, a baker in Florence, a man of humble condition but noble spirit and great wealth, who owned the finest wines. Messer Geri Spina, a prominent citizen, often passed Cisti's bakehouse with papal ambassadors. Cisti, wishing to offer them his excellent white wine but deeming it unseemly to invite them directly, devised a plan. Every morning, he would place a pail of water, a pitcher of his wine, and two silver-bright beakers outside his door. As Messer Geri passed, Cisti would drink his wine with such relish that it would make anyone thirsty.

After two mornings, Messer Geri, intrigued, asked Cisti if the wine was good. Cisti invited him and the ambassadors to taste it. Cisti personally served them, washing the beakers and ensuring no servant tasted it. The wine was excellent, and Messer Geri and the ambassadors drank it almost daily. When the ambassadors were about to depart, Messer Geri hosted a magnificent banquet and invited Cisti, who declined. Messer Geri then sent a servant to Cisti for a flask of his wine. The servant, spitefully taking a large flagon, was told by Cisti, ""My son, Messer Geri sent thee not to me."" The servant returned, and Messer Geri, realizing the servant's intent, sent him back with a smaller, appropriate flask. Cisti then cheerfully filled it. That same day, Cisti sent a small cask of the wine to Messer Geri's house, explaining that he didn't want him to think it was common wine, and that he would no longer be his steward for it. Messer Geri greatly appreciated Cisti's gift and ever after held him in high regard.

**Story 3: Madam Nonna de' Pulci (Lauretta)**
Lauretta tells of Messer Antonio d'Orso, Bishop of Florence. A Catalan gentleman, Messer Dego della Ratta, marshal for King Robert, fell in love with a beautiful Florentine lady, the Bishop's niece. Knowing her husband was miserly, Messer Dego bribed him with 500 gilded silver coins to lie with his wife. The affair became public, shaming the husband. The Bishop, a discreet man, feigned ignorance.

One St. John's Day, as the Bishop and the Marshal rode, viewing ladies, the Bishop pointed out Madam Nonna de' Pulci, a fresh, fair, well-spoken, and high-spirited young woman. He jested, ""Nonna, how deemest thou of this gallant? Thinkest thou thou couldst make a conquest of him?"" Madam Nonna, feeling her honor impugned, quickly retorted, ""Maybe, sir, he would not make a conquest of me; but, in any case, I should want good money."" Both the Marshal (who had paid for sex with the Bishop's niece) and the Bishop (whose kinswoman had been dishonored for money) felt the sting of her words. They rode off, silent and ashamed.

**Story 4: Chichibio the Cook (Neifile)**
Neifile tells of Currado Gianfigliazzi, a noble, liberal, and magnificent Florentine citizen, who enjoyed hawking. One day, he caught a fat young crane and sent it to his Venetian cook, Chichibio, to be roasted for supper. As the crane cooked, Brunetta, a neighbor's wench Chichibio loved, came into the kitchen, smelled the savory bird, and demanded a thigh. Chichibio, singing, refused. Brunetta threatened to withhold her favors. To appease her, Chichibio cut off a thigh and gave it to her.

At supper, Currado and his guests noticed the crane was missing a thigh. Currado asked Chichibio what happened. Chichibio, without hesitation, replied, ""Sir, cranes have but one thigh and one leg."" Currado, enraged, insisted he had seen cranes with two. Chichibio maintained his lie, offering to show him a live, one-legged crane the next morning. Currado, unwilling to argue before guests, swore that if Chichibio was lying, he would punish him severely.

The next morning, Currado, still angry, took Chichibio to a watercourse where cranes gathered. Chichibio, terrified, saw a dozen cranes standing on one leg, as they do when sleeping. He pointed them out to Currado, saying, ""Now, sir, if you look at those that stand yonder, you may very well see that I told you the truth yesternight, to wit, that cranes have but one thigh and one leg."" Currado cried ""Ho! Ho!"" The cranes put down their other legs and flew away. Currado asked, ""How sayst thou now, malapert knave that thou art? Deemest thou they have two legs?"" Chichibio, flustered, quickly retorted, ""Ay, sir; but you did not cry, 'Ho! Ho!' to yesternight's crane; had you cried thus, it would have put out the other thigh and the other leg, even as did those yonder."" This witty reply so amused Currado that his anger turned to laughter, and Chichibio escaped punishment.

**Story 5: Messer Forese da Rabatta and Master Giotto (Pamfilo)**
Pamfilo tells of Messer Forese da Rabatta, a learned but ugly Florentine lawyer, and Master Giotto, the renowned painter, also not handsome. Both had country houses in Mugello. One summer day, returning to Florence, they met on the road, both on sorry cart-horses and poorly dressed. A sudden shower forced them to take shelter. Wishing to reach Florence by daylight, they borrowed old, rusty cloaks and hats from a husbandman and continued their journey, now drenched and muddy.

As they rode, Messer Forese, looking at Giotto's disheveled appearance, laughed and asked, ""How sayst thou, Giotto? An there encountered us here a stranger who had never seen thee, thinkest thou he would believe thee to be, as thou art, the finest painter in the world?"" Giotto immediately retorted, ""Ay, sir, methinketh he might e'en believe it whenas, looking upon you, he should believe that you knew your A B C."" Messer Forese, realizing his own equally poor appearance, understood he had been repaid ""in his own coin.""

**Story 6: Michele Scalza (Fiammetta)**
Fiammetta tells of Michele Scalza, a merry and agreeable Florentine, known for his stories. One day, with friends at Monte Ughi, a discussion arose about the oldest and best gentlemen in Florence. Various families were named. Scalza laughed and declared, ""The best gentlemen and the oldest, not only of Florence, but of all the world or the Maremma, are the Cadgers [beggars],... upon which all the phisopholers [philosophers] and every one who knoweth them, as I do, are of accord."" He offered to wager a supper on this, to be judged by Piero di Fiorentino.

Neri Mannini accepted the wager. Piero, the judge, asked Scalza to prove his claim. Scalza argued that the older something is, the nobler it is. He asserted that God made the Cadgers when he was first learning to draw, while other men were made after he had mastered his art. As proof, he pointed to the Cadgers' distorted and disproportionate faces (long, strait, broad, crooked noses, uneven eyes), comparing them to children's first drawings, while other men have well-composed faces. Thus, the Cadgers were more ancient and therefore nobler. Piero, Neri, and all present laughed, agreeing Scalza had won the supper, acknowledging the Cadgers as the noblest and most ancient gentlemen.

**Story 7: Madam Filippa (Filostrato)**
Filostrato tells of a cruel statute in Prato: any woman caught in adultery by her husband would be burned, like a prostitute. Madam Filippa, a noble and beautiful lady, was found by her husband, Rinaldo de' Pugliesi, in bed with her lover, Lazzerino de' Guazzagliotri. Rinaldo, enraged, refrained from killing them but accused his wife under the statute.

Madam Filippa, courageous, chose to appear in court and confess the truth rather than flee. Before the provost, she firmly admitted her affair, stating it was due to her great love for Lazzerino. She then argued that laws should be common to all and made with the consent of those they concern. This statute, she claimed, was unjust because it applied only to women, who could satisfy many, and no woman had consented to its creation. She then asked the provost to question her husband if she had ever denied him ""entire commodity of myself"" whenever he desired.

Rinaldo, without waiting for the provost, immediately confirmed that she had always granted him his every pleasure. Madam Filippa then retorted, ""Then, my lord provost, if he have still taken of me that which was needful and pleasing to him, what, I ask you, was or am I to do with that which remaineth over and above his requirements? Should I cast it to the dogs? Was it not far better to gratify withal a gentleman who loveth me more than himself, than to leave it waste or spoil?"" The crowd, hearing her comical question, laughed and cried out that she was right. At the provost's instance, they modified the statute to apply only to women who sold their favors for money. Rinaldo, shamed, left the court, and Madam Filippa returned home in triumph.

**Story 8: Fresco (Emilia)**
Emilia tells of Fresco da Celatico and his niece, Ciesca, a beautiful but arrogant and disagreeable woman who constantly found fault with everyone and everything. She was so prideful that she made wry faces as if everyone she met stank. One day, she returned home early, puffing and blowing. Fresco asked why she was home so soon on a holiday. Ciesca replied that there were too many disagreeable people in the city, and she found it irksome to see them. Fresco, displeased by her airs, retorted, ""My lass, if disagreeable folk be so distasteful to thee as thou sayest, never mirror thyself in the glass, so thou wouldst live merry."" Ciesca, too foolish to understand his meaning, insisted she would mirror herself like other women, remaining in her folly.

**Story 9: Guido Cavalcanti (Neifile)**
Neifile tells of Guido Cavalcanti, a noble, witty, and learned Florentine gentleman, who was often engrossed in abstract philosophical speculations. He was rumored to be an Epicurean, seeking to prove that God did not exist. Messer Betto Brunelleschi and his company, who enjoyed banquets and jousts, tried to recruit Guido, but he avoided them. One day, as Guido walked alone among the marble tombs near San Giovanni, Messer Betto and his company, on horseback, rode up to him and, to tease him, asked, ""Guido, thou refusest to be of our company; but, harkye, whenas thou shalt have found that God is not, what wilt thou have accomplished?""

Guido, seeing himself surrounded, quickly replied, ""Gentlemen, you may say what you will to me in your own house."" He then nimbly sprang onto one of the tombs and made his escape. The gentlemen were confused, believing his answer meant nothing, as they were in a public place. But Messer Betto, a subtle man, explained, ""It is you who are the crackbrains, if you have not apprehended him. He hath courteously and in a few words given us the sharpest rebuke in the world; for that, an you consider aright, these tombs are the houses of the dead, seeing they are laid and abide therein, and these, saith he, are our house, meaning thus to show us that we and other foolish and unlettered men are, compared with him and other men of learning, worse than dead folk; wherefore, being here, we are in our own house."" They all understood and were ashamed, never bothering Guido again.

**Story 10: Fra Cipolla (Dioneo)**
Dioneo tells of Fra Cipolla, a friar of St. Anthony, who annually visited Certaldo to collect alms. He was a small, red-haired, merry, and witty man, a great talker, though unlearned. He was popular in the village. One Sunday, he announced to the villagers that after none, he would preach and show them a holy relic he brought from the Holy Land: ""one of the Angel Gabriel's feathers, which remained in the Virgin Mary's chamber, whenas he came to announce to her in Nazareth.""

Two roguish young men, Giovanni del Bragioniera and Biagio Pizzini, friends of the friar, decided to play a trick. They learned he was dining in the burgh. While his servant, Guccio Balena (a lazy, gluttonous, ill-mannered, and womanizing knave), was distracted by a cookmaid, Giovanni searched Fra Cipolla's saddle-bags. He found a small casket containing a parrot's tail-feather, which he correctly guessed was the ""angel's feather."" He took the feather, filled the casket with coals he found nearby, and replaced it, leaving everything as he found it.

After dinner, Fra Cipolla, unaware of the trick, sent Guccio for his bells and saddle-bags. Guccio, still full from the kitchen, arrived breathless. Fra Cipolla began his sermon, then, with great solemnity, prepared to reveal the feather. He praised the Angel Gabriel and his relic, then opened the casket to find it full of coals. Without changing expression, he raised his hands to heaven and, to the astonishment of the crowd, launched into an elaborate, fantastical tale. He claimed he had been sent to the East to find the ""Privileges of Porcellana"" and had traveled through many invented lands (Borgo de' Greci, Algarve, Baldacca, Parione, Sardinia, Truffia, Buffia, Menzogna, Abruzzi, Mountains of the Bachi, India Pastinaca), seeing impossible things (hedge-bills fly, Maso del Saggio selling walnut shells). He claimed to have met the ""venerable father my lord Blamemenot Anitpleaseyou, the very worshipful Patriarch of Jerusalem,"" who showed him countless relics (finger of the Holy Ghost, forelock of a seraph, Cherubim's nail, Verbum Caro's rib, vestments of Holy Catholic Faith, rays of the star of the Magi, sweat of St. Michael, jawbone of Death of St. Lazarus). In exchange for some ""Steeps of Monte Morello"" and ""chapters of the Caprezio,"" the Patriarch gave him a tooth of the Holy Rood, the sound of Solomon's Temple bells in a vial, the Angel Gabriel's feather, and coals from St. Lawrence's martyrdom.

He explained that he carried the feather in one casket and the coals in another, but they were so similar he had accidentally brought the wrong one. He declared it God's will, as St. Lawrence's feast day was near, so he could show them the blessed coals. He then offered to mark anyone with the coals, promising fire would not touch them for a year. The simple crowd, impressed, offered him money to be marked. Fra Cipolla made many crosses on their clothes, claiming the coals miraculously regenerated. Thus, by his quick wit, he escaped shame and profited from the deception. Giovanni and Biagio, who witnessed the entire performance, laughed until their jaws ached. They later returned the feather to him.

**Conclusion of Day the Sixth**
Dioneo's story caused much laughter. Elisa, her reign ended, crowned Dioneo as king, challenging him to govern the ladies well. Dioneo accepted, promising to ensure their enjoyment. He then set the theme for the seventh day: ""OF THE TRICKS WHICH OR FOR LOVE OR FOR THEIR OWN PRESERVATION WOMEN HAVE HERETOFORE PLAYED THEIR HUSBANDS WITH OR WITHOUT THE LATTER'S COGNIZANCE THEREOF."" Some ladies objected, finding the theme unseemly, but Dioneo defended it, arguing that in times of plague, with laws silent, freedom of discourse was permitted for diversion, and their virtue was beyond reproach. He also suggested that shying away from such topics might imply guilt. The ladies agreed. They then went to the Ladies' Valley, a beautiful, secluded spot with a clear stream and lakelet. They bathed naked, unseen, and then returned to the palace for supper. Pamfilo sang a song about his secret love, which was noted by the company. The king dismissed them to rest.

**Day the Seventh**

**Introduction**
At dawn, the seneschal went to the Ladies' Valley to prepare it. The king and company followed, enjoying the birdsong. They admired the valley's beauty, then had breakfast. They sang, then rested in beds prepared in the valley. After a while, they reassembled by the lake for storytelling. The king bade Emilia begin.

**Story 1: Gianni Lotteringhi (Emilia)**
Emilia tells of Gianni Lotteringhi, a simple-minded wool-comber in Florence, who was often chosen as captain of the Laudsingers and held other minor offices due to his wealth and donations to the clergy. He cherished various pious orisons taught by the friars. His discreet and beautiful wife, Mistress Tessa, was having an affair with Federigo di Neri Pegolotti. They had a secret signal system: an ass's skull on a vine pole in her garden. If the muzzle faced Florence, Federigo could come that evening; if towards Fiesole, Gianni was home. If the door was shut, he was to knock thrice.

One night, Federigo was to sup with Tessa, who had prepared two fat capons. Gianni, unexpectedly, returned late. Tessa, chagrined, hid the capons, eggs, and wine in the garden under a peach tree. Gianni and Tessa went to bed. Federigo arrived and knocked twice. Gianni heard it and nudged Tessa, who feigned awakening. She told him it was a ""phantom"" that had been frightening her. Gianni, believing his orisons (Te Lucis, Intemerata) protected them, was not afraid. Tessa, fearing Federigo might suspect something, insisted they ""exorcise"" it.

She led Gianni to the door and instructed him to spit when she told him. She then began a conjuration: ""Phantom, phantom that goest by night, with tail upright thou cam'st to us; now get thee gone with tail upright. Begone into the garden to the foot of the great peach tree; there shalt thou find an anointed twice-anointed one [fat capon] and an hundred turds of my sitting hen [eggs]; set thy mouth to the flagon and get thee gone again and do thou no hurt to my Gianni nor to me."" Gianni spat. Federigo, outside, understood the message and, despite his vexation, was amused. He waited for Gianni to spit again, then said under his breath, ""[Would it were] thy teeth!""

Tessa and Gianni returned to bed. Federigo went to the garden, found the food and wine, and supped at his ease. He later shared a laugh with Tessa about the conjuration. Emilia mentions a variant where a husbandman accidentally turned the ass's skull, and another where the story happened to Gianni di Nello, another simpleton. She concludes that the orisons are very effective in such cases.

**Story 2: Peronella (Filostrato)**
Filostrato tells of Peronella, a beautiful young woman in Naples, wife of a poor mason. She took a lover, Giannello Strignario. They arranged for Giannello to visit her when her husband left for work. One morning, Giannello was with Peronella when her husband unexpectedly returned. Peronella quickly hid Giannello in a large vat in the shed. She then opened the door to her husband, feigning anger, accusing him of returning early and neglecting their livelihood.

The husband explained it was a holiday and he had sold the old vat, which cluttered the house, for five florins. Peronella, quick-witted, claimed she had already sold it for seven florins to a man who was currently inside, inspecting its soundness. The husband was pleased. Giannello, overhearing, emerged from the vat, pretending to have just finished his inspection. He complained the vat was dirty and needed scraping. The husband, eager for the seven florins, agreed to clean it. While he was inside the vat, scraping, Peronella, leaning into the vat's mouth to direct him, allowed Giannello to make love to her. When both tasks were completed, Giannello paid the husband seven florins and had the vat carried to his house.

**Story 3: Fra Rinaldo (Elisa)**
Elisa tells of Rinaldo, a noble young man in Siena, who loved his beautiful neighbor, Madam Agnesa, wife of a rich man. To gain access, he became godfather to her child, thus becoming her ""gossip."" Later, Rinaldo became a friar, but his love for Agnesa rekindled. He began to visit her frequently, pressing his suit. Agnesa, initially hesitant due to their gossip-relationship, eventually yielded, convinced by Rinaldo's argument that he, being less akin to her child than her husband, could lie with her just as her husband did. They continued their affair discreetly.

One day, Rinaldo was with Agnesa in her bedchamber, having sent her maid and his comrade to the pigeon-loft. Agnesa's husband unexpectedly returned and knocked at the door. Agnesa, terrified, told Rinaldo, who was in his waistcoat, that they were discovered. Agnesa, seizing an idea, told Rinaldo to dress, take their child, and listen to her. She then opened the door to her husband, feigning great joy, claiming Fra Rinaldo had come just in time to save their child from a sudden fainting fit caused by ""worms."" She said Rinaldo was conjuring the worms and that only the mother could be present.

The simple husband believed her. Rinaldo, having dressed and taken the child, confirmed the story, claiming the child was now cured. The husband, overjoyed, thanked Rinaldo. Rinaldo's comrade, who had been with the maid in the pigeon-loft, also returned, claiming to have finished his orisons. The husband, completely fooled, entertained them with wine and confections. He later made a waxen image of his child and hung it in the church as an ex-voto.

**Story 4: Tofano (Lauretta)**
Lauretta tells of Tofano, a rich but jealous man in Arezzo, and his beautiful wife, Ghita. Tofano's jealousy, being unfounded, annoyed Ghita, who decided to give him reason for it. She found a lover and, discovering Tofano enjoyed drinking, encouraged him to get drunk. When he was intoxicated, she would put him to bed and meet her lover. She grew so confident that she sometimes spent the night at her lover's house.

One evening, Tofano, suspecting her, feigned extreme drunkenness. Ghita, believing him, put him to bed and went to her lover's house. Tofano immediately arose, locked the doors from within, and waited at the window. When Ghita returned at midnight, she found herself locked out. Tofano confronted her, saying she couldn't re-enter and he would expose her. Ghita pleaded, claiming she was with a neighbor. Tofano remained firm. Ghita then threatened to throw herself into a nearby well, knowing he would be blamed for her death.

Tofano, unmoved, told her to leave her distaff. Ghita took a large stone, cried, ""God pardon me!"" and dropped it into the well. Tofano, believing she had jumped, rushed out with a bucket and rope to save her. Ghita, who had hidden near the door, slipped inside and locked him out. She then went to the window and taunted him, ""You should water your wine, whenas you drink it, and not after and by night."" Tofano, realizing he was tricked, demanded entry. Ghita, now shouting, refused, threatening to expose his late-night returns. Neighbors, awakened by the commotion, blamed Tofano. Ghita's kinsfolk arrived, beat Tofano, and took Ghita home. Tofano, seeing his jealousy had backfired, made peace with his wife, promising never to be jealous again and giving her leave to do as she pleased, provided she was discreet.

**Story 5: A Jealous Husband (Fiammetta)**
Fiammetta tells of a rich merchant in Rimini who was excessively jealous of his beautiful wife without cause. He kept her confined, not allowing her out or even to look from a window. The wife, feeling unjustly suspected, resolved to give him reason for his jealousy. She noticed a handsome young man in the adjoining house. She found a small crack in the wall between their bedchambers and, through pebbles and soft calls, managed to communicate with him. He enlarged the hole, and they exchanged words and touched hands, but could go no further due to the husband's vigilance.

As Christmas approached, the wife asked her husband for permission to go to church for confession and communion. He agreed, but only to their parish chapel, early, and to their chaplain or a priest he appointed, then straight home. The wife suspected his plan. On Christmas morning, she went to church. Her husband, having arranged with the chaplain, disguised himself as a priest with a large cowl and sat in the choir. The chaplain sent him to hear her confession. The wife, recognizing him despite his disguise and muffled voice, decided to give him what he sought.

She confessed to being married but in love with a priest who visited her every night. She claimed he knew a charm that made her husband fall asleep and opened all doors. The jealous husband, enraged, almost ended the confession but wanted to know more. He rebuked her, but she claimed she loved the priest too much to stop. He offered to pray for her and send a clerk to check on her progress. She refused to have anyone sent to her house, fearing her husband's jealousy.

The husband, bursting with rage, returned home. That night, he told his wife he would be away and instructed her to lock all doors. The wife, however, signaled her lover through the wall, telling him her husband would be watching the street door, so he should come by the roof. The lover agreed. The husband hid by the street door all night, cold and supperless, waiting for the priest. The lover entered by the roof, and he and the wife made love.

In the morning, the husband, exhausted, returned to his room. He sent a boy (as the priest's clerk) to ask his wife if the ""priest"" had visited. She replied he hadn't. Finally, the husband confronted her, demanding to know the priest's identity. She laughed, revealing she knew he was the disguised priest. She explained that his jealousy had blinded him, and his ""priest"" was himself, his ""charms"" his own access, and his nightly visits were his own presence. She concluded that if she ever wanted to cuckold him, she could do so even if he had a hundred eyes. The husband, realizing he was completely fooled, gave up his jealousy. The wife, now with license, brought her lover in through the door and continued their affair discreetly.

**Story 6: Madam Isabella (Pampinea)**
Pampinea tells of Madam Isabella, a noble and beautiful Florentine lady, wife of a worthy gentleman. She took a lover, Leonetto, a well-bred young man. They enjoyed their secret love. Isabella was also pursued by Messer Lambertuccio, a powerful gentleman whom she disliked but feared. She reluctantly yielded to his threats.

One summer day, Isabella was at her country estate, her husband away. She sent for Leonetto. While they were together, her maid announced Messer Lambertuccio's arrival. Isabella was terrified. She hid Leonetto behind the bed curtains. Lambertuccio entered, embraced and kissed her, and they went to her chamber. As they were making love, the maid announced the unexpected return of Isabella's husband.

Isabella, realizing she had two men in the house and Lambertuccio's horse was visible in the courtyard, thought quickly. She told Lambertuccio to take his dagger, rush downstairs with an angry face, and leave, shouting, ""I vow to God that I will take him elsewhere."" If her husband questioned him, he was to say nothing else. Lambertuccio, fearing for his life, obeyed. The husband, dismounting, saw Lambertuccio rush out, shouting threats. He asked what was happening. Lambertuccio, mounting his horse, only repeated, ""Cock's body, I shall find him again otherwhere,"" and rode off.

The husband found Isabella at the stairhead, disheveled and fearful. She claimed an unknown young man had fled into her chamber, pursued by Lambertuccio, and she had prevented Lambertuccio from entering. The husband praised her for preventing murder in their house. He then asked where the young man was. Leonetto, who had heard everything, emerged, trembling. He claimed Lambertuccio had attacked him on the road for no reason. The husband, believing him, promised to escort him home safely. After supper, the husband took Leonetto home. Leonetto then discreetly met Lambertuccio and explained the situation. The husband never learned of his wife's deception.

**Story 7: Lodovico (Filomena)**
Filomena tells of Lodovico, a Florentine gentleman who became rich as a merchant in Paris. He was sent to serve the King of France. He heard travelers praise Madam Beatrice, wife of Messer Egano de' Gulluzzi of Bologna, as the most beautiful lady. Lodovico, instantly enamored, feigned a pilgrimage to the Holy Sepulchre to go to Bologna. There, he saw Beatrice and fell deeply in love. He resolved to win her love. He disguised himself as a servant, Anichino, and took service with Messer Egano, quickly becoming his most trusted man.

One day, while Egano was fowling, Anichino played chess with Beatrice. When they were alone, he sighed. Beatrice, curious, asked the cause. Anichino, after feigning reluctance, confessed his true identity, his love for her, and why he had become Egano's servant. He begged her to have compassion. Beatrice, moved by his words and his worth, returned his love, promising to meet him that night. She instructed him to come to her chamber at midnight, where she would leave the door open.

That night, Egano, tired from fowling, went to bed early. Beatrice left her chamber door open. Anichino entered, closed the door, and went to her bed. As he touched her, she took his hand and, turning in bed, woke Egano. She then asked Egano whom he considered his most trusted servant. Egano replied Anichino. Anichino, hearing this, was terrified, thinking she would expose him. Beatrice then told Egano that Anichino had tried to seduce her that day and had arranged to meet her in the garden by the pine tree that night. She suggested Egano, disguised in her gown and veil, go in her place to test Anichino's fidelity.

Egano, eager to test Anichino, dressed in his wife's clothes and went to the garden. As soon as he left, Beatrice locked the door and returned to bed with Anichino, who was overjoyed by her cleverness. They made love. After a while, Beatrice told Anichino to take a stout cudgel, go to the garden, and beat Egano (still disguised as her) while pretending to scold her for her supposed infidelity. Anichino obeyed, beating Egano severely. Egano fled back to the chamber, complaining of the beating. Beatrice, feigning sympathy, said Anichino had tested her with words and him with deeds, proving his loyalty. Egano, convinced, believed he had the truest wife and most loyal servant. Anichino and Beatrice continued their affair discreetly.

**Story 8: A Man Waxeth Jealous (Neifile)**
Neifile tells of Arriguccio Berlinghieri, a rich Florentine merchant, who married the noble Madam Sismonda. Arriguccio, often away on business, became fiercely jealous. He would not sleep until he felt Sismonda in bed and slept soundly. Sismonda, unhappy, took a lover, Ruberto. To meet him, she devised a system: she would tie a twine to her great toe, extending it out her window to the street. Ruberto would pull it at midnight. If she let go, her husband was asleep; if she held it, he was awake.

One night, Arriguccio, stretching his foot, felt the twine. He realized the trick, cut the twine from her toe, and tied it to his own. Ruberto pulled, and Arriguccio, thinking it was a signal, rushed out armed to catch the lover. Ruberto, hearing the loud opening of the door, realized it was Arriguccio and fled. Arriguccio pursued him, and they fought.

Meanwhile, Sismonda awoke, found the twine cut, and knew she was discovered. She quickly called her maid and persuaded her to take her place in the bed, enduring any beating from Arriguccio. She put out the light and hid. Arriguccio, returning from the fight (which had attracted neighbors), entered the dark chamber, found the maid, whom he thought was Sismonda, and beat her severely, cutting off her hair, while she cried for mercy. He then locked her in and went to Sismonda's brothers to expose her.

Sismonda, hearing him leave, comforted the maid and rewarded her. She then made the bed, dressed, and sat sewing at the stairhead, feigning innocence. Arriguccio arrived with Sismonda's three brothers and mother. He recounted his discovery of the twine, the pursuit, the beating, and presented the maid's hair as proof. The brothers, enraged, followed him home. Sismonda, seeing them, greeted them calmly. Her brothers, seeing her composed and unharmed, began to doubt Arriguccio. He insisted he had beaten her, but she denied it, showing her unblemished face and unshorn hair.

Sismonda then accused Arriguccio of being a drunken philanderer, claiming he must have gone to bed with a ""trull"" and, waking, imagined he was beating her. Her mother, furious at Arriguccio's accusations, supported Sismonda, calling him a ""four-farthing huckster"" unworthy of her daughter. The brothers, convinced Arriguccio was drunk and mistaken, severely rebuked him, warning him never to bring such news again. Arriguccio, utterly confused, left his wife in peace. Sismonda, by her wit, not only escaped peril but secured her freedom for future affairs.

**Story 9: Lydia (Pamfilo)**
Pamfilo tells of Nicostratus, a nobleman in Argos, whose young and spirited wife, Lydia, fell in love with his handsome and trusted servant, Pyrrhus. Pyrrhus, initially unaware or unwilling, seemed indifferent. Lydia, distraught, confided in her chamberwoman, Lusca, who conveyed her mistress's fervent love to Pyrrhus. Pyrrhus, fearing a trick, demanded three proofs of her love: she must kill Nicostratus's favorite hawk in his presence, send him a lock of her husband's beard, and one of his best teeth. Lydia, though finding these hard, agreed, adding she would also make love to him in Nicostratus's presence and make her husband believe it was not real.

First, at a dinner party, Lydia deliberately killed Nicostratus's hawk, claiming it stole his time from her. The guests, amused, turned Nicostratus's anger into laughter. Pyrrhus, witnessing this, was encouraged. Second, while toying with Nicostratus, she playfully pulled out a lock of his beard, claiming it was revenge for him pulling her hair. She sent the beard to Pyrrhus. Third, she convinced Nicostratus that he had bad breath due to a rotten tooth. She then offered to extract it herself, sending everyone else away. With Lusca's help, she painfully extracted one of his teeth, which she sent to Pyrrhus.

Now convinced, Pyrrhus was ready. Lydia, feigning illness, asked Nicostratus and Pyrrhus to take her to the garden. They sat under a pear tree. Lydia asked Pyrrhus to climb the tree for pears. As he threw down pears, Pyrrhus began to shout, ""How now, my lord! What is this you do? And you, madam, are you not ashamed to suffer it in my presence?"" He claimed to see Nicostratus making love to Lydia. Nicostratus was astonished, thinking Pyrrhus was raving. Lydia feigned indignation, suggesting the tree was enchanted. Nicostratus, to prove it, climbed the tree. As soon as he was up, Lydia and Pyrrhus made love below. Nicostratus, seeing them, cried out. The lovers, seeing him descend, quickly resumed their innocent positions.

Nicostratus, enraged, confronted them. Pyrrhus, feigning confusion, claimed that just as Nicostratus had seen falsely from the tree, he himself must have seen falsely earlier. Lydia feigned fury, saying she would never be so foolish as to commit adultery in front of him. Nicostratus, convinced by their arguments that the tree caused hallucinations, ordered it cut down. Pyrrhus readily complied. Lydia, feigning forgiveness, reconciled with her husband. Pyrrhus and Lydia continued their affair more easily.

**Story 10: Two Siennese (Dioneo)**
Dioneo tells of two Siennese friends, Tingoccio Mini and Meuccio di Tura, who made a pact: the first to die would return to tell the other about the afterlife. Tingoccio became godfather to Mistress Mita's child, and then, despite the gossip-relationship, fell in love with her. Meuccio also loved her but kept it secret. Tingoccio and Mistress Mita became lovers. Meuccio, aware of their affair, feigned ignorance, hoping to eventually have her himself.

Tingoccio, from his excessive lovemaking with his gossip, fell ill and died. Three days later, his ghost appeared to Meuccio, fulfilling their pact. Meuccio, initially frightened, asked if Tingoccio was damned. Tingoccio said he was in torment for his sins but not damned. He described the punishments for various sins. Meuccio then asked if there was anything he could do for him (masses, prayers, alms). Tingoccio agreed. Meuccio then asked about the punishment for lying with a gossip. Tingoccio replied that in the afterlife, ""no manner of account [is] taken of gossips."" Hearing this, Meuccio was greatly relieved and decided to pursue his own affair with Mistress Mita without guilt.

**Conclusion of Day the Seventh**
Dioneo's story caused much laughter, especially the part about ""no account is taken of gossips."" Lauretta, her reign ended, crowned Emilia as queen. Emilia, after making arrangements, announced that for the next day, there would be no fixed theme, allowing everyone to tell stories as they pleased. She explained that after many days of restricted themes, it was good to have a ""truant"" day. The company approved. The ladies then visited the ""Ladies' Valley"" again, bathing naked in the lakelet. The young men, hearing of its beauty, visited it after supper. Pamfilo sang a song about his secret love, which was noted by the company. The queen then dismissed them to rest.

**Day the Eighth**

**Introduction**
On Sunday morning, the company arose, walked in the dewy grass, and visited a nearby church for divine service. They returned for breakfast, then sang and danced. After their rest, they reassembled by the fountain. Queen Neifile (this seems to be a mistake in the text, as Emilia was crowned queen at the end of Day 7, and the introduction for Day 8 states ""under the governance of Elisa is discoursed..."". However, the text then says ""Neifile, by her commandment, began thus."" I will follow the text as written, noting the discrepancy in the summary.) began the day's stories.

**Story 1: Gulfardo (Neifile)**
Neifile tells of Gulfardo, a German soldier in Milan, known for his loyalty and prompt repayment of debts. He fell in love with Madam Ambruogia, wife of a rich merchant, Guasparruolo Cagastraccio, a friend of his. Gulfardo discreetly pursued her. The lady, after some negotiation, agreed to his advances if he kept it secret and gave her 200 gold florins for a personal need.

Gulfardo, indignant at her greed, decided to trick her. He told her he would gladly give her the money and would bring it when he came to her, with a trusted comrade as a witness. The lady, pleased, arranged a meeting when her husband was away. Gulfardo then went to Guasparruolo and borrowed 200 florins at his usual low interest. A few days later, Guasparruolo went to Genoa. Gulfardo, with his comrade, went to Ambruogia's house and, in his comrade's presence, gave her the 200 florins, saying, ""Madam, take these monies and give them to your husband, whenas he shall be returned."" Ambruogia, thinking he did this to hide the payment from his friend, counted them and put them away, then took Gulfardo to her chamber. They made love many times before her husband returned.

When Guasparruolo came back, Gulfardo, again with his comrade, approached him in his wife's presence. Gulfardo stated he no longer needed the 200 florins Guasparruolo had lent him and had returned them to his wife. Guasparruolo asked his wife, who, seeing the witness, could not deny it. She confirmed she had the money. Guasparruolo was satisfied. Gulfardo left. The lady, realizing she had been tricked, had to give her husband the money, having received nothing for her favors. Thus, Gulfardo enjoyed his ""sordid mistress without cost.""

**Story 2: The Parish Priest of Varlungo (Pamfilo)**
Pamfilo tells of a lusty priest in Varlungo who was enamored of Mistress Belcolore, a jolly, buxom country woman. He pursued her with gifts of garlic, peascods, and chives. One day, he met Belcolore's husband, Bentivegna, who was going to Florence. The priest, seeing his opportunity, went to Belcolore's house. He confessed his love, and she, feigning coyness, asked if priests did such things. He assured her they did, and better, promising it would be ""shrewdly to thy profit."" She, calling priests stingy, asked what profit. He offered shoes, a head-lace, or a waistband. She refused, saying she had enough. She then proposed a deal: if he lent her five crowns to redeem her watchet gown and Sunday girdle from pawn, she would do his will.

The priest claimed not to have the money on him. Belcolore, suspicious, insisted he go get it. Fearing he would lose the opportunity, the priest offered his blue-cloth cloak as a pledge. Belcolore, after some haggling about its value, took the cloak. They then went to the barn, where they made love. The priest, after taking his leave, realized the cloak was worth more than five crowns. He devised a plan to get it back.

The next day, a holiday, he sent a boy to Belcolore, asking to borrow her stone mortar to make sauce for guests. Belcolore sent it. Later, while Bentivegna and Belcolore were at dinner, the priest sent his clerk to return the mortar and demand the cloak back as a ""token."" Bentivegna, angered that his wife had taken a pledge from the priest, ordered her to return it immediately. Belcolore, grumbling, gave the cloak to the clerk, telling him to tell the priest she would never again pound sauce in her mortar. The clerk reported this. The priest, laughing, sent back a message: if she wouldn't lend her mortar, he wouldn't lend his pestle, and they would be ""quits."" Belcolore bore a grudge but eventually made peace with him over must and roast chestnuts. The priest replaced her tabret's parchment and added hawk's bells, which she accepted in lieu of the five crowns.

**Story 3: Calandrino, Bruno, and Buffalmacco (Heliotrope) (Elisa)**
Elisa tells another story of Calandrino, Bruno, and Buffalmacco. Maso del Saggio, a witty young man, decided to play a trick on the simple-witted painter Calandrino. In the church of San Giovanni, Maso and a friend, pretending not to see Calandrino, discussed the virtues of stones. Maso claimed that in Bengodi (a fantastical land of plenty) there was a mountain of grated Parmesan cheese where people cooked macaroni and ravioli in capon broth, throwing them down for others to catch. Calandrino, intrigued, asked about the capons, and Maso said the Basques ate them. Calandrino, believing this, asked if such wonder-working stones could be found locally.

Maso then spoke of the ""Heliotrope,"" a black stone found in the Mugnone river, which made its bearer invisible. Calandrino, excited, sought out Bruno and Buffalmacco, telling them of the stone and his plan to become rich by stealing money from exchangers. Bruno and Buffalmacco, amused, feigned interest. They agreed to search for it the following Sunday, when there would be fewer people about and the black stones would be easier to distinguish. Calandrino, impatient, awaited Sunday.

On Sunday morning, they went to the Mugnone. Calandrino, eager, picked up every black stone he saw, stuffing them into his bosom and the folds of his gown. When he was heavily laden, Bruno and Buffalmacco, pretending not to see him, began to call out, ""Where is Calandrino?"" They then accused him of abandoning them to go home for dinner, scoffing at the idea of finding such a stone. Calandrino, believing the heliotrope was working, remained silent and began walking home, laden with stones. As he walked, Bruno and Buffalmacco, still pretending not to see him, threw stones at his shins and back, saying they would make him remember the trick.

At the San Gallo gate, the customs officers, forewarned by Bruno and Buffalmacco, feigned not to see Calandrino, laughing heartily. Calandrino reached home, where his wife, Mistress Tessa, scolded him for being late for dinner. Calandrino, realizing he was visible, was furious. He accused his wife of ""undoing"" him (making the stone lose its power) and beat her severely. Bruno and Buffalmacco arrived, feigning concern. Calandrino, still angry, explained that his wife's presence had ruined the heliotrope's magic. The two friends pretended to believe him, but blamed him for not warning his wife. They then ""made peace"" between him and his bruised wife, leaving him disconsolate with a house full of stones.

**Story 4: The Rector of Fiesole (Emilia)**
Emilia tells of a rector of Fiesole who fell in love with Madam Piccarda, a noble widow. The rector, old in years but young in wit, was arrogant and ill-mannered. Piccarda hated him but, to rid herself of his persistent solicitations, consulted her brothers. With their permission, she devised a plan. She feigned to yield to the rector's advances, agreeing to meet him in her dark bedchamber that evening, warning him that her brothers slept nearby and he must be silent.

Piccarda had a very ugly, crooked, and squinting maidservant named Ciutazza. She bribed Ciutazza with a new shift to lie in her bed and embrace the rector, but to remain silent. That night, the rector arrived, entered the dark chamber, and lay with Ciutazza, believing her to be Piccarda. Meanwhile, Piccarda's brothers, as arranged, went to the main square. By chance, the bishop, wanting to drink with them, encountered them and returned to their house. The brothers then led the bishop and others to Piccarda's chamber. The rector, who had fallen asleep with Ciutazza, awoke to the light and the crowd. Ashamed, he hid his head. The bishop rebuked him, making him reveal his companion. The rector, realizing the trick, was mortified. He was sent home under guard and forced to do penance. The bishop, learning the full story, commended Piccarda and her brothers for their cleverness. The rector suffered public humiliation and was mocked by children, remaining tormented for a long time. Ciutazza, meanwhile, got her shift and a merry night.

**Story 5: Three Young Men and a Marchegan Judge (Filostrato)**
Filostrato tells of Maso del Saggio and his two friends, Ribi and Matteuzzo, who were known for their mad humor. They observed a Marchegan judge, Messer Niccola da San Lepidio, who had come to Florence for the Provost. The judge was a comical figure, poorly dressed, with an inkhorn at his girdle, and breeches that came halfway down his legs. Maso noticed that the judge's bench was constructed so that one could easily pass underneath and reach through cracks in the floorboards.

Maso proposed a trick: they would pull down the judge's breeches while he was on the bench. The friends agreed. The next morning, in a crowded court, Matteuzzo crept under the bench. Maso and Ribi approached the judge, each grabbing a skirt of his gown, and began a loud, fake dispute about stolen saddle-bags and boothose, accusing each other and demanding justice. The judge stood up and leaned forward to hear them better. Matteuzzo, seizing the opportunity, grabbed Messer Niccola's breeches and pulled them down. The breeches, being loose, came down easily. The judge, confused, tried to sit and cover himself, but Maso and Ribi held him, continuing their loud argument. Matteuzzo then slipped away. Maso and Ribi, having achieved their goal, also fled. The judge, realizing his humiliation, swore to find out if it was customary in Florence to pull down judges' breeches. The Provost, informed of the prank, was told it was a Florentine way of showing that he had brought incompetent judges. He decided to keep silent to avoid further shame.

**Story 6: Bruno and Buffalmacco (Pig) (Filomena)**
Filomena tells another story of Calandrino, Bruno, and Buffalmacco. Calandrino had a pig from his farm, which he and his wife usually salted. One year, his wife was ill, so he went alone. Bruno and Buffalmacco, staying with a priest friend nearby, saw the pig and decided to steal it. They tried to convince Calandrino to sell it and tell his wife it was stolen, but he refused. They then plotted to steal it that night.

They took Calandrino to the tavern with the priest, where Bruno made sure Calandrino drank heavily, paying for everything. Calandrino, easily fuddled, went home, leaving his door open, and fell asleep. Bruno and Buffalmacco entered, took the pig, and carried it to the priest's house. The next morning, Calandrino discovered his pig missing and his door open. He made a great outcry. Bruno and Buffalmacco arrived, feigning surprise. Bruno subtly suggested Calandrino was lying to his wife. Calandrino, distraught, insisted the pig was stolen.

Buffalmacco proposed an ordeal by bread and cheese to find the thief among the neighbors. Bruno suggested ginger boluses and good wine instead, as a less suspicious method. Calandrino, desperate, gave Bruno money to buy the ingredients. Bruno bought ginger boluses and secretly prepared two dog-balls with aloes, covering them with sugar like the others, and marking them. He returned, and they arranged for Calandrino to invite his suspicious neighbors to drink the next morning.

The next day, Calandrino gathered his neighbors. Bruno explained the ordeal: whoever swallowed a bolus easily was innocent; whoever found it bitter and spat it out was the thief. He gave each person a bolus, and when he came to Calandrino, he gave him one of the aloes-laced ones. Calandrino immediately spat it out. Bruno gave him another, which he also spat out, weeping from the bitterness. Everyone concluded Calandrino had stolen his own pig.

After everyone left, Bruno and Buffalmacco accused Calandrino of stealing the pig and lying. They claimed he had a mistress to whom he gave his money and the pig. They demanded two pairs of capons, threatening to tell his wife. Calandrino, not wanting more trouble with his wife, gave them the capons. They salted the pig and took the capons to Florence, leaving Calandrino to lament his losses.

**Story 7: A Scholar and a Widow Lady (Pampinea)**
Pampinea tells of Elena, a beautiful, haughty, and wealthy widow in Florence, who had a lover. Rinieri, a learned scholar returned from Paris, fell passionately in love with her. Elena, vain, encouraged his attention, believing it enhanced her beauty. She accepted his letters and gifts but gave him only vague promises. To prove to her lover (who was growing jealous) that Rinieri was no threat, she finally promised Rinieri a rendezvous on Christmas Eve, telling him to wait in her courtyard.

It had snowed heavily. Rinieri waited in the cold courtyard. Elena, after supping with her lover, went to a lattice with him to watch Rinieri. Her maid told Rinieri that Elena's brother was visiting, delaying her. Rinieri, believing her, patiently waited. Elena and her lover mocked him. Near midnight, Elena and her lover watched Rinieri dancing in the snow to keep warm. Elena then called to Rinieri from the door, still feigning her brother's presence, telling him to wait longer and make a fire when he came in. She and her lover returned to bed, laughing at Rinieri.

Rinieri, freezing and realizing he was tricked, felt his love turn to bitter hatred. He resolved to seek revenge. He feigned continued love. Some time later, Elena's lover abandoned her for another woman, leaving her distraught. Her maid, thinking Rinieri could use necromancy to bring the lover back, suggested she seek his help. Elena, desperate, agreed. Rinieri, overjoyed at the chance for revenge, agreed to help. He instructed Elena to bathe naked seven times in a running stream at midnight during the waning moon, then climb an uninhabited tower, face north, and recite a conjuration with a pewter image.

Elena, eager, went to her farm by the Arno. Rinieri, hidden nearby, watched her bathe and climb the tower. He felt a moment of pity and temptation but, remembering his past suffering, remained resolute. He then quietly removed the ladder from the tower. Elena, after reciting the conjuration, waited for the two damsels she expected. As dawn broke, she realized she had been tricked. She tried to descend but found the ladder gone. She fainted, then, recovering, wept, blaming herself and the scholar.

The sun rose, scorching her naked body. Flies and gadflies stung her. She suffered from hunger, thirst, and the heat. She was disfigured. She called for help, but no one was around. Rinieri, after sleeping, returned to the tower. Elena begged him for water or death. Rinieri, enjoying her torment, refused, reminding her of the cold he suffered. He mocked her beauty, saying it would be marred. He claimed his revenge was just, and that his pen could have inflicted worse shame. He told her to cast herself down if she wished to die.

Elena continued to plead. Finally, Rinieri, after much delay, agreed to help, for the sake of the new lady he claimed to love. He asked where her clothes were. She told him. He went to his friend's house for dinner and a nap, leaving his servant to guard the tower. Elena, alone and despairing, fell asleep. The sun continued to burn her. A husbandman, searching for lost swine, found her. He helped her down and carried her to his house. Her maid, rushing to the tower, fell from the ladder and broke her thigh. Elena and her maid were taken to Florence. Elena, using her wit, fabricated a story of diabolical bewitchments to explain their injuries. She recovered, renounced love, and avoided mocking others. Rinieri, hearing of the maid's broken thigh, felt his revenge complete.

**Story 8: Two Men Consorting Together (Fiammetta)**
Fiammetta tells of Spinelloccio Tanena and Zeppa di Mino, two close friends and neighbors in Siena, both with beautiful wives. Spinelloccio began an affair with Zeppa's wife. One day, Zeppa, at home unexpectedly, saw his wife and Spinelloccio kissing and going into a chamber. Zeppa, enraged, hid, resolving to take revenge without public scandal.

After Spinelloccio left, Zeppa confronted his wife, who confessed. Zeppa, to forgive her, demanded she help him trick Spinelloccio. She was to invite Spinelloccio to her house the next morning. When Zeppa returned, she was to hide Spinelloccio in a chest. The next morning, Spinelloccio, having promised to meet Zeppa's wife, made an excuse to leave Zeppa. He went to Zeppa's house and entered the chamber with Zeppa's wife. When Zeppa returned, she quickly locked Spinelloccio in the chest.

Zeppa then asked his wife to invite Spinelloccio's wife to dine, as Spinelloccio was supposedly dining elsewhere. Spinelloccio's wife came. Zeppa, taking her hand, led her to the chamber, locked the door, and revealed he knew of her husband's affair with his wife. He declared his revenge: he would lie with her on the chest where her husband was hidden. He then made love to Spinelloccio's wife on the chest. Spinelloccio, trapped inside, heard and felt everything. He was initially furious but realized he had initiated the offense and Zeppa was acting humanely. He resolved to remain friends.

After they finished, Zeppa's wife, asking for a promised jewel, was shown her husband in the chest. Spinelloccio emerged, and, acknowledging they were ""quits,"" proposed they remain friends and share their wives. Zeppa agreed. All four dined together in harmony. From then on, each lady had two husbands, and each man two wives, without strife.

**Story 9: Master Simone the Physician (Elisa)**
Elisa tells of Master Simone da Villa, a physician from Bologna, rich but ignorant, who returned to Florence dressed ostentatiously. He was curious about Bruno and Buffalmacco, two poor but merry painters, believing they had a secret source of wealth. He befriended Bruno, who, realizing Simone's foolishness, decided to play a trick. Bruno claimed he and Buffalmacco were part of a secret company that ""went a-roving,"" acquiring wealth and pleasures (including beautiful women like the Queen of England and the Empress of Tartary) through magical means, without stealing. He described lavish banquets and beautiful women. He warned Simone to keep it secret.

Simone, believing this fantastical tale, was desperate to join. He plied Bruno with hospitality. Bruno, in return, painted a picture of Lent in Simone's saloon and an Agnus Dei by his chamber, along with a chamber-pot over the street door. Bruno continued to tease Simone with stories of their ""roving"" adventures. Simone, eager to join, finally confessed his desire to Bruno, boasting of his own noble birth, wealth, learning, and ability to attract women. Bruno, barely containing his laughter, feigned reluctance but eventually agreed to help, on condition of secrecy. He told Simone that Buffalmacco would soon be captain of the company and could admit him. Simone was to befriend and honor Buffalmacco.

Simone lavished hospitality on both painters. When he felt the time was right, he asked Buffalmacco to admit him. Buffalmacco feigned anger at Bruno for revealing the secret but was ""pacified"" by Simone's apologies. Buffalmacco then ""praised"" Simone's wit, calling him a ""seed-pumpkin"" and saying he was ""baptized on a Sunday"" (meaning simple). He promised to admit Simone. They then described the ""Countess of Jakes"" (public sewers) as a grand lady whom Simone would meet.

The painters instructed Simone to go to a raised tomb outside Santa Maria Novella at the first sleep, dressed in his finest scarlet gown. A ""black horned beast"" would come, caper, and whistle to terrify him. If he showed no fear, he was to mount the beast, cross his hands, and name neither God nor saints. The beast would take him to the company. If he showed fear, he might be thrown into a ""place where you are like to stink for it."" Simone, confident in his courage, agreed.

That night, Simone, in his scarlet gown, waited on a tomb. Buffalmacco, disguised as a horned bear, raged about the piazza. Simone, terrified, eventually mounted the ""beast."" Buffalmacco carried him to the dykes near the Nunnery of Ripole, which were filled with ordure. He then pitched Simone headfirst into the filth. Buffalmacco and Bruno, who had been watching, laughed. Simone struggled out, covered in excrement, and returned home. His wife, disgusted, scolded him for his philandering.

The next morning, Bruno and Buffalmacco, having painted themselves with bruises, confronted Simone, accusing him of disloyalty and causing them to be beaten. Simone tried to explain, but they refused to listen, saying he had called on God and the saints, breaking the rules. Simone, terrified of public exposure, appeased them with more hospitality. Thus, Simone, the ""sheepshead"" from Bologna, learned a lesson.

**Story 10: A Certain Woman of Sicily (Dioneo)**
Dioneo tells of a custom in Palermo where merchants' goods are stored in a customhouse, and their details recorded. Many beautiful but dishonest women, posing as noble ladies, used this information to lure merchants into affairs and rob them. Salabaetto, a Florentine merchant, arrived in Palermo with woollen cloths worth 500 gold florins. He displayed his wealth and was noticed by Madam Biancofiore, one of these ""barberesses."" She sent her maid to him, feigning love and arranging a secret meeting at a bagnio.

Salabaetto, believing her to be a great lady, was overjoyed. At the bagnio, he found a lavish setup. Biancofiore, after embracing him, personally bathed him with musk-scented soap. They were then carried to a bed, sprinkled with sweet waters, and given confections and wine. Salabaetto felt he was in Paradise. After the slave-girls left, he and Biancofiore made love. She then invited him to sup and lie with her at her house. He agreed. At her house, he saw rich furnishings and perfumes, further convincing him of her high status. He spent the night with her, growing more enamored. In the morning, she gave him a silver girdle and purse, pledging her devotion.

Salabaetto sold his cloths at a good profit. Biancofiore, learning of his success, decided to get more from him. One night, she feigned distress, claiming her brother needed 1,000 gold florins within eight days to avoid execution, and she had no way to get it. Salabaetto, blinded by love, offered his 500 florins, which she accepted, promising to repay him in a fortnight.

After she had the money, Biancofiore became distant. When the fortnight passed, then a month or two, she gave him excuses instead of repayment. Salabaetto realized he had been tricked. Ashamed, he left Palermo for Naples, where he confided in his friend Pietro dello Canigiano, a shrewd treasurer. Canigiano advised him to return to Palermo, feigning to have brought even more valuable merchandise. Salabaetto bought casks of water with a little oil on top and bales of tow, claiming they were worth 2,000 and 3,000 florins, respectively. He stored them in the customhouse, saying he awaited more goods.

Biancofiore, hearing of his new wealth, regretted taking only 500 florins. She invited him, feigning renewed love, and returned his 500 florins, apologizing for the delay. Salabaetto, now cunning, accepted the money and renewed his ""love"" in words. He then told her he needed 1,000 florins to ransom a ship of his ""merchandise"" (the water and tow) captured by corsairs. Biancofiore, fearing to lose him and his supposed wealth, offered to lend him the money at a high interest, secured by his customhouse goods. Salabaetto agreed.

He took the 1,000 florins and returned to Naples, repaying Canigiano and his masters. He then went to Ferrara, abandoning his merchant career. Biancofiore, waiting for his return, eventually had his magazines opened. She found the casks full of seawater and the bales full of tow. Realizing she had been outwitted, she lamented her losses, saying, ""Who with a Tuscan hath to do, Must nor be blind nor see askew."" She learned, to her cost, that some people are as cunning as others.

**Conclusion of Day the Eighth**
Dioneo's story, though less laughed at than usual due to its unseemly parts, allowed the ladies to recover from the melancholy of the previous tales. Lauretta, her reign ended, crowned Emilia as queen, praising her beauty. Emilia, blushing, accepted. She declared that for the next day, there would be no fixed theme, allowing everyone to tell stories as they pleased, as a respite from strict rules. This was commended by all. They then engaged in various diversions until supper. Pamfilo sang a song about the joy of secret love. The king then dismissed them to rest.

**Day the Ninth**

**Introduction**
At dawn, Queen Emilia and her company walked to a nearby coppice, where they saw wild animals unafraid due to the pestilence. They played with the animals, then returned to the palace. After singing, dinner, and rest, they reassembled for storytelling. Emilia bade Filomena begin.

**Story 1: Madam Francesca (Filomena)**
Filomena tells of Madam Francesca de' Lazzari, a beautiful widow in Pistoia, who was courted by two Florentine exiles, Rinuccio Palermini and Alessandro Chiarmontesi. She disliked both but had unwisely encouraged them. To rid herself of their importunity, she set them an impossible task. A notoriously ugly and wicked man, Scannadio, had just been buried in a tomb outside the Minor Friars' church. Francesca told her maid to go to Alessandro and tell him that to win her love, he must go to Scannadio's tomb at first sleep, dress in the dead man's clothes, and wait to be carried to her house by her kinsmen. He must not move or speak. If he refused, he was never to approach her again. The maid was then to tell Rinuccio that to win Francesca's love, he must go to the tomb at midnight, secretly carry Scannadio's body to her house, and not speak or move for anything he heard or felt.

Both men, eager for her love, agreed. Alessandro, on his way to the tomb, had second thoughts, fearing a trap or injury. However, his love compelled him. He opened the tomb, stripped Scannadio, dressed in his clothes, and lay in his place, terrified. Rinuccio, on his way to the tomb, also had fears of being caught by the police or shaming his family. But his love drove him on. He opened the tomb, grabbed Alessandro's feet (thinking it was Scannadio), and carried him off towards Francesca's house, bumping him against benches in the dark.

Francesca, watching from her window with her maid, saw Rinuccio carrying Alessandro. Just then, the watch, ambushed nearby, put out a light and challenged Rinuccio. Rinuccio dropped Alessandro and fled. Alessandro, hampered by the long dead man's clothes, also fled. Francesca, seeing Alessandro in Scannadio's clothes, was amazed but laughed, pleased to be rid of both. She returned inside, believing they had both proven their love by attempting her task.

Rinuccio, cursing his luck, returned to the tomb but couldn't find Alessandro. He went home. Alessandro, also returning home, did not recognize Rinuccio. The next day, Scannadio's tomb was found open and empty (Alessandro had rolled the body to the bottom of the vault). Pistoia buzzed with rumors of devils. Both lovers separately reported their efforts to Francesca, claiming to have fulfilled her conditions. She, feigning disbelief, refused them both, saying they had failed.

**Story 2: An Abbess (Elisa)**
Elisa tells of a convent in Lombardy, renowned for its sanctity. A beautiful young nun, Isabetta, fell in love with a handsome young man she met at the grate. They began a secret affair. One night, another nun saw Isabetta's lover leaving. She told other nuns, and they decided to catch Isabetta in the act and report her to the abbess, Madam Usimbalda, a reputedly pious woman.

That night, Isabetta's lover came. The watchful nuns, at the opportune moment, ran to the abbess's chamber and knocked loudly, announcing Isabetta's transgression. The abbess was herself in bed with a priest, whom she often secretly entertained. In her haste and the dark, she grabbed the priest's breeches instead of her coif and threw them over her head. She rushed out, locking the door, and led the nuns to Isabetta's cell. They broke down the door and found Isabetta and her lover in bed.

The nuns seized Isabetta and dragged her to the chapter-house. Her lover dressed and waited, ready to fight if she was harmed. The abbess, in front of all the nuns, severely rebuked Isabetta for shaming the convent. Isabetta, initially silent, eventually looked up and saw the abbess wearing the priest's breeches, with the hose-points dangling. Realizing the abbess's own secret, Isabetta calmly said, ""Madam, God aid you, tie up your coif and after say what you will to me."" The abbess, not understanding, continued her tirade. Isabetta repeated her request. Other nuns looked up and saw the breeches. The abbess, realizing her own exposed fault, changed her tone. She concluded that resisting fleshly desires was impossible and decreed that all nuns should discreetly enjoy themselves. She then returned to her priest, and Isabetta returned to her lover, continuing their affairs.

**Story 3: Master Simone (Calandrino with Child) (Filostrato)**
Filostrato tells another story of Calandrino, Bruno, and Buffalmacco, joined by Nello. Calandrino inherited 200 crowns and foolishly boasted of buying an estate, while refusing to spend money on his friends. Bruno and Buffalmacco, with Nello, plotted to get money from him. Nello approached Calandrino, asking if he was ill, saying he looked ""changed."" Buffalmacco then reinforced this, saying he looked ""half dead."" Calandrino, now convinced he was sick, began to feel feverish. Bruno suggested he go home, get to bed, and send his urine to Master Simone, the physician (the same Master Simone from Day 8, Story 9, who was tricked by Bruno and Buffalmacco).

Calandrino went home and to bed. Bruno went to Master Simone, briefed him on the prank, and then the maid arrived with Calandrino's urine. Master Simone, after examining it, told the maid that Calandrino was ""with child."" The maid reported this. Master Simone and Bruno then visited Calandrino. Simone confirmed his ""pregnancy."" Calandrino roared in pain, blaming his wife, Tessa, for always being ""uppermost"" during sex. Tessa, a modest woman, blushed and left. Calandrino lamented how he would ""bring forth this child"" and wished death upon his wife.

Bruno, Buffalmacco, and Nello struggled to contain their laughter, while Master Simone laughed immoderately. Calandrino begged the physician for help. Simone promised to deliver him in a few days for some expense. Calandrino offered his 200 crowns. Simone said he would make a ""ptisan of distilled waters"" and needed three pairs of fat capons and five silver crowns for other ingredients. Calandrino gave Bruno the money. Simone then sent a clary (spiced wine) to Calandrino. Calandrino drank it for three mornings. The doctor then declared him cured. Calandrino, overjoyed, boasted of how Master Simone had ""unbegotten him with child in three days' time."" Bruno, Buffalmacco, and Nello were pleased with their successful trick, though Tessa, understanding the deception, scolded her husband.

**Story 4: Cecco Fortarrigo (Neifile)**
Neifile tells of two Siennese men, both named Cecco: Angiolieri (son of Messer Angiolieri) and Fortarrigo (son of Messer Fortarrigo). They were friends, both disliked by their fathers. Angiolieri, finding his allowance insufficient, decided to seek his fortune with a cardinal in the Marches of Ancona. He got an advance from his father and sought a servant. Fortarrigo, hearing this, begged to accompany him as a servant, without wages, only expenses. Angiolieri initially refused, knowing Fortarrigo was a gambler and drunkard, but Fortarrigo swore to reform. Angiolieri reluctantly agreed.

They went to dine at Buonconvento. After dinner, Angiolieri went to sleep, telling Fortarrigo to wake him at none. Fortarrigo went to the tavern, gambled away his own money, then, in his shirt, stole Angiolieri's money from his purse while he slept, and lost that too. Angiolieri awoke, found his money gone, and assumed Fortarrigo was drunk somewhere. He ordered his horse prepared to leave Fortarrigo. As he was about to pay, he found himself penniless. An uproar ensued.

Fortarrigo, in his shirt, appeared, suggesting they wait for someone to redeem his doublet. Someone then informed Angiolieri that Fortarrigo had gambled away his money. Angiolieri, enraged, threatened Fortarrigo but, fearing others, mounted his horse. Fortarrigo, pretending not to hear, continued to insist Angiolieri help him redeem his doublet for a better price. Angiolieri, exasperated, rode off. Fortarrigo, devising a trick, trotted after him in his shirt for two miles, still demanding his doublet. He then cried out to some husbandmen in a field, ""Stop him, stop him!"" claiming Angiolieri had robbed him.

The husbandmen, seeing Fortarrigo in his shirt and Angiolieri on horseback, believed Fortarrigo. They stopped Angiolieri. Fortarrigo then accused Angiolieri of theft. Despite Angiolieri's protests, the countrymen helped Fortarrigo pull him from his horse, strip him, and dress in his clothes. Fortarrigo then rode off on Angiolieri's palfrey, leaving Angiolieri in his shirt and barefoot. Angiolieri, humiliated, returned to Buonconvento and eventually to his kinsfolk, while Fortarrigo boasted of his ""win"" in Siena.

**Story 5: Calandrino and Niccolosa (Fiammetta)**
Fiammetta tells another story of Calandrino. Niccolo Cornacchini hired Bruno, Buffalmacco, Nello, and Calandrino to paint his mansion at Camerata. Niccolo's son, Filippo, often brought women there. One day, Filippo brought Niccolosa, a beautiful and well-dressed woman. Calandrino, seeing her, was instantly smitten. Bruno, noticing Calandrino's infatuation, realized who Niccolosa was (Filippo's mistress). Calandrino, believing Niccolosa was Filippo's wife, confided in Bruno, asking for help. He worried about Nello, who was Tessa's (Calandrino's wife) kinsman.

Bruno, Buffalmacco, and Nello (who was in on the joke) plotted. Bruno told Calandrino that Niccolosa was melting for him. Calandrino, overjoyed, boasted of his prowess. Bruno suggested he bring his rebeck and sing to her. Calandrino, convinced, brought his rebeck and sang. He became obsessed with seeing Niccolosa, constantly running to windows and doors. Bruno, acting as go-between, brought him fake messages and letters from Niccolosa, promising a rendezvous and asking for gifts (comb, purse, knife). Calandrino, delighted, gave them gifts and collations.

After two months, with the painting nearing completion, Calandrino pressed Bruno for a meeting. When Niccolosa next came to the mansion, Bruno arranged with her and Filippo. He then told Calandrino that Niccolosa had agreed to meet him in the barn that day, and he would give him a talismanic script to touch her with, which would make her follow him. Calandrino eagerly provided the parchment and a bat. Bruno gave him the script.

Nello, meanwhile, went to Calandrino's wife, Tessa, telling her Calandrino was having an affair and was meeting his lover in the barn that day. Tessa, enraged, went to the mansion with Nello. Filippo, seeing them approach, told the painters to work hard and hid to watch. Calandrino, seeing Filippo leave, found Niccolosa alone, touched her with the script, and went to the barn. Niccolosa followed, closed the door, and, mounting Calandrino on the straw, embraced him, praising his beauty and expressing her long-held desire for him.

Bruno, Buffalmacco, and Filippo watched and heard everything. Tessa, arriving, burst into the barn and found Niccolosa astride Calandrino. Niccolosa fled to Filippo. Tessa furiously attacked Calandrino, scratching his face and tearing his hair, calling him a ""besotted dotard"" and a ""sorry shitten cur."" Calandrino, terrified, begged her to stop, claiming Niccolosa was the master's wife. Bruno and Buffalmacco intervened, feigning to appease Tessa, but blamed Calandrino for not warning his wife that women ""caused things to lose their virtue."" They advised him to return to Florence and never come back. Calandrino, humiliated and bruised, fled, his love cured by his wife's reproaches.

**Story 6: Two Young Gentlemen (Pamfilo)**
Pamfilo tells of an innkeeper in the Mugnone plain, a poor man with a beautiful wife and two children: an unmarried daughter, Niccolosa (15-16), and a baby son. Pinuccio, a young gentleman, loved Niccolosa, and she him. They had a secret affair. Pinuccio, wanting to spend a night with her, planned to stay at her father's inn with a friend, Adriano. They arrived late, feigning to be returning from Romagna. The host, familiar with them, welcomed them.

The inn had one small bedchamber with three beds. The host put Pinuccio and Adriano in one, his daughter in another, and he and his wife in the third, with the baby's cradle beside them. Pinuccio, after everyone seemed asleep, crept to Niccolosa's bed, where she joyfully received him. While they were together, a cat knocked something over. The hostess, waking, went to investigate. Meanwhile, Adriano, needing to relieve himself, moved the cradle from beside the host's bed to his own. He then returned to his bed. The hostess, returning in the dark, felt for the cradle, and finding it by Adriano's bed, mistook Adriano for her husband and lay with him. Adriano, awake, joyfully made love to her.

Pinuccio, having finished with Niccolosa, returned to his bed. Finding the cradle by the host's bed, he mistook the host for Adriano and lay down beside him. He then boasted to the host (thinking him Adriano) about his delightful night with Niccolosa. The host, awakened, was enraged, realizing Pinuccio had been with his daughter. He threatened Pinuccio. Pinuccio, realizing his mistake, tried to cover it up, feigning confusion. The hostess, hearing her husband's angry voice and Adriano's laughter, realized her own mistake. She quickly moved the cradle to her daughter's bed and then feigned to wake, asking her husband what was happening.

The host accused Pinuccio. The hostess denied it, claiming Pinuccio was dreaming, and that she had been in bed all night. Adriano, also in on the new deception, supported her, telling Pinuccio he often dreamed extravagantly. The host, convinced Pinuccio was dreaming, laughed and shook him awake. Pinuccio, feigning sleepiness, returned to Adriano's bed. The next day, the host mocked Pinuccio about his dreams. The young men, amused, departed for Florence. Niccolosa, convinced her mother that Pinuccio had dreamt it, continued her affair. The hostess, remembering Adriano's embraces, inwardly acknowledged her own secret.

**Story 7: Talano di Molese (Pampinea)**
Pampinea tells of Talano di Molese, a worthy man, and his beautiful but froward wife, Margarita. One night, Talano dreamt he saw Margarita walking in a wood near their country house. A fierce wolf attacked her, mangling her neck and face. He awoke and warned her not to go out that day, especially into the wood, recounting his dream. Margarita, scornful, accused him of wishing her ill and wanting to keep her from a tryst he had arranged. She declared she would go to the wood to see what he was up to.

Her husband left. Margarita, secretly, went to the wood and hid. Suddenly, a large wolf emerged from a thicket, seized her by the throat, and carried her off. She could not scream. She would have been throttled, but shepherds, seeing the attack, shouted, forcing the wolf to release her. They carried her home, severely injured. After long medical care, she healed, but her throat and part of her face were permanently disfigured. She was ashamed to be seen and bitterly regretted her stubborn refusal to believe her husband's dream.

**Story 8: Biondello and Ciacco (Lauretta)**
Lauretta tells of Ciacco, a famous glutton in Florence, who, lacking funds, became a spunger, frequenting rich men's tables. Biondello, a dapper and witty man, also a spunger, was Ciacco's rival. One Lent morning, Ciacco saw Biondello buying two fine lampreys for Messer Vieri de' Cerchj. Ciacco asked what he was doing. Biondello, to trick him, claimed Messer Corso Donati had received finer lampreys and a sturgeon, but needed these two more for a dinner he was giving. He invited Ciacco. Ciacco, eager for a good meal, agreed.

At Messer Corso's house, Ciacco found him with neighbors, about to dine. Ciacco announced he had come to dine. They sat down, and Ciacco was served chickpeas, pickled tunny, and fried fish from the Arno – a meager meal. Ciacco realized Biondello had tricked him. He resolved to get revenge. A few days later, he met Biondello, who, laughing, asked about Messer Corso's lampreys. Ciacco replied, ""That shalt thou know much better than I, ere eight days be past.""

Ciacco hired a shrewd huckster. He showed him Messer Filippo Argenti, a big, choleric, and humoursome gentleman. Ciacco instructed the huckster to go to Messer Filippo with a glass flagon and say, ""Sir Biondello sendeth me to you and prayeth you be pleased to rubify him this flask with your good red wine, for that he would fain make merry somedele with his minions."" He warned the huckster to flee if Filippo tried to grab him. The huckster delivered the message. Messer Filippo, enraged by the perceived mockery, tried to seize him, but the huckster escaped.

Ciacco, pleased, paid the huckster. He then found Biondello and told him Messer Filippo was looking for him. Biondello, unsuspecting, went to meet Filippo. Filippo, still fuming, saw Biondello, attacked him, and beat him severely, tearing his clothes and rolling him in the mud, demanding to know why he sent such a message. Biondello, confused, could not reply. Bystanders intervened, explaining Filippo's anger. Biondello, realizing Ciacco's revenge, returned home, bruised and sick. After he recovered, Ciacco met him and asked about Filippo's wine. Biondello replied, ""Even as thou of Messer Corso's lampreys."" Ciacco then warned him that if he ever tried to trick him again, he would return the favor. Biondello, knowing Ciacco's cunning, left him in peace.

**Story 9: Two Young Men and Solomon (Emilia)**
Emilia tells of Melisso, a rich gentleman from Lajazzo, who sought counsel from Solomon on how to be loved, as he spent lavishly but found no true affection. On his journey to Jerusalem, he met Giosefo, who sought counsel on how to reform his froward and perverse wife. They agreed to seek Solomon's wisdom together. Melisso presented his case, and Solomon simply replied, ""Love."" Giosefo then presented his, and Solomon replied, ""Get thee to Goosebridge."" Both, finding these answers unhelpful, returned home, feeling mocked.

On their way, they saw a muleteer struggling to make a stubborn mule cross a bridge. The muleteer, despite the protests of Melisso and Giosefo, beat the mule furiously until it crossed. Giosefo, learning the bridge was called ""Goosebridge,"" suddenly understood Solomon's advice: he needed to beat his wife.

In Antioch, Giosefo's wife greeted him scurvily. He instructed her to prepare supper as Melisso ordered. She, as usual, did the opposite. Giosefo, vexed, took a stout oak stick, went to her chamber, seized her by the hair, threw her down, and beat her severely. She cried out and threatened him, but he continued until she begged for mercy and promised to obey him. He stopped when he was tired. The next morning, she asked him what he wanted for dinner, and everything was prepared perfectly. Giosefo and Melisso praised Solomon's counsel. Melisso later understood Solomon's advice to him: he should love genuinely, not for ostentation. Thus, Giosefo's wife was reformed, and Melisso learned to be loved by loving.

**Story 10: Dom Gianni (Dioneo)**
Dioneo tells of Dom Gianni di Barolo, a poor priest in Barletta, who supplemented his income by trading at fairs with his mare. He was friends with Pietro da Tresanti, who had a young, buxom wife, Gemmata. Dom Gianni often stayed at Pietro's house, sleeping in the stable with his mare, as Pietro only had one small bed for himself and his wife.

Dom Gianni once told Gemmata that he could transform his mare into a beautiful woman and lie with her, then change her back. Gemmata, believing him, told Pietro, urging him to learn the charm so he could transform her into a mare, use her for work with his ass, and then change her back. Pietro, dull-witted, was convinced and pestered Dom Gianni. The priest, unable to dissuade him, finally agreed, saying the hardest part was ""putting on the tail.""

The next morning, Pietro and Gemmata, impatient, woke Dom Gianni. The priest, in his shirt, instructed Pietro to hold a light and remain silent, praying the ""tail"" would stick. He stripped Gemmata naked, made her stand on all fours, and began to pass his hand over her, saying, ""Be this a fine mare's head,"" ""Be this a fine mare's mane,"" ""Be these fine mare's legs and feet,"" and ""Be this a fine mare's chest"" (as his penis became erect). Finally, for the tail, he pulled up his shirt and thrust his penis into her vagina, saying, ""And be this a fine mare's tail.""

Pietro, witnessing this, cried out, ""Ho there, Dom Gianni, I won't have a tail there, I won't have a tail there!"" Dom Gianni, withdrawing, exclaimed that Pietro had ruined the charm by speaking, and it could not be done again. Pietro insisted he didn't want a tail and that the priest was setting it too low. Gemmata, hearing this, scolded Pietro for ruining their chance, saying no mare was without a tail. She dressed, disconsolate. Pietro, continuing his trade with his ass, never again asked for such a service.

**Conclusion of Day the Ninth**
The company laughed at Dioneo's story, which the ladies understood better than Dioneo intended. Emilia, her reign ended, crowned Pamfilo as king, challenging him to make amends for her and his predecessors' defaults. Pamfilo accepted and set the theme for the tenth day: ""OF WHOSO HATH ANYWISE WROUGHT GENEROUSLY OR MAGNIFICENTLY IN MATTERS OF LOVE OR OTHERWHAT."" He hoped this would inspire worthy actions and eternal renown. The company, pleased, engaged in diversions until supper. Neifile sang a song about her secret love, which was commended. The king then dismissed them to rest.

**Day the Tenth**

**Introduction**
At dawn, King Pamfilo and his company walked, discussing their future lives. They returned to the palace, refreshed themselves, and enjoyed the garden. After dinner and a siesta, they reassembled. Pamfilo called on Neifile to begin the day's stories.

**Story 1: A Knight in the King's Service of Spain (Neifile)**
Neifile tells of Messer Ruggieri de' Figiovanni, a noble and wealthy Florentine gentleman, who sought service with King Alfonso of Spain, renowned for his valor. Ruggieri was graciously received and quickly gained a reputation for worth and prowess. However, he observed the King distributing castles and baronies to unworthy individuals, while he, a man of merit, received nothing. Feeling his reputation diminished, he decided to leave and requested permission from the King. Alfonso granted it, giving him a fine mule for his journey. He secretly instructed a discreet servant to ride with Ruggieri, note his comments, and then command him to return.

As they rode, Ruggieri, near tierce, suggested they let their beasts urinate. All did except the mule. Later, by a river, the mule finally urinated. Ruggieri exclaimed, ""Marry, God confound thee, beast, for that thou art made after the same fashion as the prince who gave thee to me!"" The servant noted this. The next morning, the servant revealed the King's command for Ruggieri to return.

Back at court, the King asked Ruggieri why he had likened the mule to him. Ruggieri frankly replied that the mule, like the King, gave where it should not and withheld where it should give. King Alfonso explained that his lack of reward was due to Ruggieri's ""fortune,"" not his own fault, and offered to prove it. Ruggieri accepted. The King led him to a hall with two locked coffers. One contained his crown, scepter, orb, and all his precious jewels; the other was full of earth. Ruggieri was to choose one, and it would be his. Ruggieri chose the coffer of earth.

King Alfonso, laughing, said this proved Ruggieri's fortune was to blame. He then declared he would defy fortune. He gave Ruggieri the coffer of jewels, along with the mule, so he could return to Tuscany and boast of his worth and the King's generosity. Ruggieri, grateful, returned to Tuscany.

**Story 2: Ghino di Tacco (Elisa)**
Elisa tells of Ghino di Tacco, a cruel robber, exiled from Siena, who raised Radicofani against the Church. He plundered travelers. Pope Boniface VIII was in Rome. The Abbot of Cluny, a very rich prelate, fell ill and was advised to go to the baths of Siena. He traveled with great pomp, disregarding Ghino's reputation. Ghino ambushed him and his retinue, taking them all. He sent a messenger to the Abbot, inviting him to his castle. The Abbot, furious, refused, but seeing himself surrounded, reluctantly went.

Ghino lodged the Abbot alone in a dark, mean chamber, while his retinue was well accommodated. Ghino then asked the Abbot his destination and purpose. The Abbot explained his illness and his journey to Siena for a cure. Ghino, resolving to cure him without baths, kept a fire burning in the room and brought him only two slices of toasted bread and a beaker of wine each day. He continued this for several days until the Abbot, cured of his stomach complaint by the enforced diet, expressed a desire to eat.

Ghino then had a magnificent banquet prepared, inviting the Abbot's household and local gentry. He brought the Abbot to a well-appointed chamber and then to the banquet. Ghino did not reveal his identity until the Abbot was well. He then showed the Abbot all his retinue and goods, saying, ""My lord abbot, you must know that it was the being a gentleman and expelled from his house and poor and having many and puissant enemies, and not evilness of mind, that brought Ghino di Tacco (who is none other than myself) to be... a highway-robber."" He then offered the Abbot to take whatever portion of his recovered goods he wished, or all of them.

The Abbot, amazed by Ghino's generosity, embraced him, his anger turning to friendship. He took only a few necessary items and left the rest to Ghino. He returned to Rome. The Pope, hearing of his capture, asked about the baths. The Abbot replied he found a physician nearer who had cured him. He then recounted Ghino's story. The Pope, impressed by Ghino's worth, granted the Abbot's request to pardon Ghino and make him a prior of the Hospitallers. Ghino accepted, becoming a loyal servant of the Church and the Abbot.

**Story 3: Mithridanes and Nathan (Filostrato)**
Filostrato tells of Nathan, a noble and immensely rich man in Cattajo, who built a magnificent palace by a highway, offering lavish hospitality to all travelers. His fame spread. Mithridanes, a rich young man from a nearby country, envied Nathan's renown and sought to surpass him in generosity. He built a similar palace and offered even more extravagant hospitality, becoming famous himself.

One day, an old woman, after receiving alms from Mithridanes at twelve different gates, returned for the thirteenth. Mithridanes, recognizing her, remarked on her diligence. The old woman exclaimed, ""O liberality of Nathan, how marvellous art thou! For that, entering in by each of the two-and-thirty gates which his palace hath, and asking of him an alms, never, for all that he showed, was I recognized of him, and still I had it; whilst here, having as yet come in but at thirteen gates, I have been both recognized and chidden.""

Mithridanes, enraged by Nathan's superior generosity, resolved to kill him, believing he could not surpass him otherwise. He traveled to Nathan's palace, alone, and found Nathan walking in his garden, simply dressed. Unknowing him, Mithridanes asked where Nathan lived. Nathan, cheerfully, offered to lead him there and ensure he was not seen or known by Nathan. Mithridanes accepted. Nathan, secretly instructing his servants not to reveal his identity, lodged Mithridanes honorably.

Mithridanes, after some days, asked his host who he was. Nathan replied he was an old, unworthy servant of Nathan, who had never been promoted. This gave Mithridanes hope. Nathan then courteously asked Mithridanes his purpose, offering aid. Mithridanes, after some hesitation, confessed his identity and his intention to kill Nathan out of envy. Nathan, though inwardly disturbed, calmly advised him to go to a nearby coppice where Nathan walked alone every morning, and to escape by a specific path after the deed.

The next morning, Nathan went to the coppice, prepared to die. Mithridanes arrived, sword in hand, and confronted Nathan, saying, ""Old man, thou art dead."" Nathan replied, ""Then have I merited it."" Mithridanes, recognizing Nathan's voice and face, was overcome with shame and remorse. He threw down his sword, fell at Nathan's feet, and confessed his envy and murderous intent, acknowledging Nathan's superior generosity.

Nathan raised him, embraced him, and forgave him, praising his noble spirit. He explained that he had given him advice on how to kill him because he never denied a guest's wish. He had lived eighty years and was ready to give his life as a gift, rather than have it taken by nature. He offered his life again. Mithridanes, ashamed, refused. Nathan then proposed they exchange identities: Mithridanes would live in Nathan's palace as Nathan, and Nathan would live in Mithridanes's palace as Mithridanes. Mithridanes declined, saying he could not diminish Nathan's fame. They returned to the palace, where Nathan entertained Mithridanes for days, encouraging his noble aspirations. Mithridanes returned home, having learned that he could never surpass Nathan in liberality.

**Story 4: Messer Gentile de' Carisendi (Lauretta)**
Lauretta tells of Messer Gentile Carisendi, a noble Bolognese gentleman, who loved Madam Catalina, wife of Niccoluccio Caccianimico. His love was unrequited, so he left for Modona as provost. Meanwhile, Catalina, pregnant, fell gravely ill at her country house and was pronounced dead by physicians. Believing the child was not fully formed, her kinswomen buried her in a church vault.

Gentile, hearing of her death, resolved to visit her tomb and kiss her, since he could not do so alive. He secretly rode to the church with a servant, opened the sepulchre, and lay beside her, kissing her. Overcome by desire, he touched her breast and felt a faint heartbeat. Realizing she was alive, he and his servant carefully removed her from the tomb and took her to his house in Bologna. His mother, a discreet lady, revived Catalina with warm baths. Catalina awoke, confused, and Gentile explained everything. Catalina was distressed but thanked him, begging him not to dishonor her. Gentile promised to treat her as a sister but asked a favor: that she stay with his mother until he returned from Modona, so he could present her to her husband in honor. Catalina, grateful, agreed.

Soon after, Catalina gave birth to a healthy son. Gentile, overjoyed, ensured she and the child were well cared for. He returned to Modona, completed his term, and then arranged a grand banquet at his house in Bologna, inviting many gentlemen, including Niccoluccio Caccianimico. At the banquet, Gentile posed a ""doubt"" to his guests: if a master abandoned a sick servant, and a stranger revived him, did the first master have a right to reclaim the servant? Niccoluccio, chosen to respond, declared that the first master had no right, and the servant justly belonged to the second. All agreed.

Gentile then announced he would honor them by showing them his most precious possession. He brought in Catalina, magnificently dressed, holding her beautiful son. Many recognized her but believed her dead. Niccoluccio, captivated, asked if she was Bolognese. She remained silent. Gentile then revealed her identity, recounting how he had found her abandoned and brought her back to life. He declared that, by their own judgment, she was now his, and Niccoluccio had no right to reclaim her.

Gentile then, taking the child in his arms and Catalina by the hand, went to Niccoluccio. He said he was not returning Niccoluccio's abandoned wife, but giving him his ""gossip"" (Catalina) and his son (whom he had baptized Gentile). He swore that Catalina had lived chastely in his house. He then released Catalina from her promise to him. Niccoluccio, overjoyed, received his wife and son, thanking Gentile. All present praised Gentile's magnanimity. Catalina was welcomed home as one risen from the dead. Gentile remained a friend to both families.

**Story 5: Madam Dianora (Emilia)**
Emilia tells of Madam Dianora, a noble and beautiful lady in Udine, Friuli, wife of the debonair Gilberto. Messer Ansaldo Gradense, a valiant and courteous baron, loved her passionately and pursued her relentlessly. To rid herself of him, Dianora made an impossible demand: she would grant him her favors if he could present her with a garden as fair in January as in May, full of green grass, flowers, and trees in leaf. If he failed, he must stop importuning her.

Ansaldo, though despairing, found a nigromancer who, for a great sum, promised to create such a garden. In January, amidst snow and ice, the nigromancer used his arts to create a beautiful garden, full of flowers and fruits. Ansaldo, overjoyed, sent a selection of fruits and flowers to Dianora, reminding her of her promise. Dianora, seeing the miraculous garden, regretted her oath. Her husband, Gilberto, noticing her distress, demanded the reason. She, ashamed, confessed everything.

Gilberto, initially angry, then, considering her pure intent and fearing the nigromancer, made a magnanimous decision. He told Dianora that while her promise was foolish, he would absolve her of it. He instructed her to go to Ansaldo and try to be released from her promise, but if it was unavoidable, she was to yield her body, but not her soul.

The next morning, Dianora, with her servants, went to Ansaldo's house. Ansaldo, marveling at her arrival, called the nigromancer. Dianora, with tears, explained that her husband, out of generosity, had commanded her to fulfill her promise. Ansaldo, moved by Gilberto's magnanimity, declared that he would not dishonor a man who had shown such compassion for his love. He released Dianora from her promise, asking only that she thank her husband and consider him a brother and servant.

Dianora, overjoyed, returned to Gilberto, and a strong friendship formed between him and Ansaldo. The nigromancer, seeing Gilberto's generosity and Ansaldo's magnanimity, refused his payment, saying he would also be liberal with his hire. Ansaldo, after three days, had the magical garden disappear. He extinguished his lustful love for Dianora, replacing it with honorable affection.

**Story 6: King Charles the Old (Fiammetta)**
Fiammetta tells of King Charles I (the Old), who expelled the Ghibellines from Florence. Messer Neri degli Uberti, a Ghibelline gentleman, fled Florence with his family and wealth to Castellamare di Stabia. He built a beautiful house with a delightful garden and a fishpond. King Charles, resting in Castellamare, heard of the garden's beauty. Knowing Neri was an adversary, he decided to visit him familiarly and sent word he would sup in his garden with four companions. Neri, making magnificent preparations, welcomed the King.

As the King and his company dined by the fishpond, two beautiful young daughters of Messer Neri, Ginevra the Fair and Isotta the Blonde (about fifteen), entered the garden. They were lightly dressed in fine linen, with golden hair and periwinkle chaplets. One carried hand-nets and a pole, the other a frying-pan, wood, trivet, oil, and a torch. The King watched, amazed. The girls, blushing, bowed to him, then entered the fishpond. They caught fish, which a servant cooked and served to the King. The King and his guests were delighted, playing with the fish. The girls then emerged from the water, their wet garments clinging to their bodies, revealing their delicate forms, and returned to the house.

The King was captivated by their beauty and grace, feeling a fervent desire for them. He asked Neri who they were, and Neri identified them as his twin daughters. The King commended them and urged him to marry them, to which Neri replied he was too poor. The girls then returned, dressed in fine silk gowns, with silver platters of fruit, and sang a beautiful song. The King was enchanted. He felt himself falling deeply in love with Ginevra, and by extension, Isotta. He feigned other reasons to maintain intimacy with Neri, often visiting the garden to see Ginevra.

Unable to control his passion, he confided in Count Guy de Montfort, revealing his desire to take both daughters from Neri. Count Guy, an honorable man, rebuked the King. He reminded him of his age, his new kingdom, the treachery of the people, and the dishonor of betraying Neri's hospitality, especially since Manfred's violence against women had helped Charles gain the kingdom. He urged the King to conquer himself, not just others.

The King, stung by conscience, promised to overcome his appetite. Not long after, he returned to Naples. To avoid dishonor and reward Neri, he decided to marry the two girls, not as Neri's daughters, but as his own. He dowered them magnificently and gave Ginevra to Messer Maffeo da Palizzi and Isotta to Messer Guglielmo della Magna, both noble barons. With great chagrin, he consigned them to their husbands and went to Apulia, where he mortified his desires through constant fatigue, breaking the chains of love. Fiammetta concludes that while marrying two girls might seem a small thing for a king, it was a great act of magnanimity for an enamored king to give his beloved to another without having enjoyed her.

**Story 7: King Pedro of Arragon (Pampinea)**
Pampinea tells of Lisa, daughter of Bernardo Puccini, a rich Florentine apothecary in Palermo. During a festival, Lisa saw King Pedro of Arragon tilting and fell passionately in love with him. She was tormented by the impossibility of her love due to her humble birth. She grew visibly ill. Her parents, concerned, tried to help her. She asked her father to bring Minuccio d'Arezzo, a famous singer and player, to her.

Lisa confided in Minuccio, revealing her secret love for the King and her despair, stating she wished to die but wanted the King to know her love before she did. She begged Minuccio to convey this to him. Minuccio, moved, promised to help. He commissioned a poet, Mico da Siena, to write a plaintive canzonet expressing Lisa's love and longing. Minuccio set it to music. Three days later, he sang it to King Pedro, who was dining. The King, captivated, asked for whom the song was made. Minuccio, in private, revealed Lisa's story.

King Pedro, pleased by Lisa's noble spirit, promised to visit her that evening. Minuccio, overjoyed, brought the news to Lisa, who showed immediate signs of recovery. At vespers, the King, feigning a diversion, visited Bernardo's house. He entered Lisa's chamber, took her hand, and encouraged her to recover. Lisa, feeling his touch, was in paradise and replied that her illness was due to her ""subjection of her little strength to grievous burdens"" (her love for him), but she would recover thanks to his goodness. The King, understanding her veiled words, esteemed her more. He left, promising to return.

Lisa recovered and became more beautiful. The King, after consulting the Queen, decided to reward Lisa's love honorably. He visited Bernardo's house with the Queen and many barons. He called Lisa and, in the presence of all, told her that her love had earned her great honor. He would arrange her marriage and would always consider himself her knight, asking only for one kiss. Lisa, blushing, humbly accepted, reiterating her love for him and her obedience. She said she knew it was foolish for her to love a king, but love was beyond choice. She thanked the King and Queen for their graciousness.

King Pedro then called Lisa's parents, who agreed to his plan. He summoned Perdicone, a noble but poor young man, and married him to Lisa, giving them two rich fiefs, Ceffalu and Calatabellotta, as her dowry. He then kissed Lisa on the brow, declaring himself her knight. Perdicone and Lisa celebrated a joyous wedding. The King faithfully kept his word, always wearing a favor from Lisa in deeds of arms.

**Story 8: Sophronia and Titus Quintius Fulvus (Filomena)**
Filomena tells of Titus Quintius Fulvus, a Roman gentleman's son, sent to study philosophy in Athens. He lodged with Chremes, his father's friend, and became inseparable friends with Chremes's son, Gisippus. They excelled in their studies. After three years, Chremes died. Gisipp"
The Divine Comedy-Dante Alighieri,"The narrator finds himself lost in a dark, savage wood, having strayed from the right path. He attempts to climb a mountain but is blocked by a nimble panther, a fierce lion, and a lean she-wolf, which drive him back into the gloom. A faint voice calls to him, and he encounters the shade of Virgil, a renowned ancient Roman poet.

Virgil explains that the she-wolf prevents passage and is insatiable, but a ""greyhound"" will eventually destroy her. He offers to guide the narrator through an eternal space to escape the beast, where he will see tormented spirits and those hoping for blessedness. However, Virgil cannot lead him to the highest heaven, as he is a rebel to God's law. The narrator, eager to escape, accepts Virgil as his guide.

As day ends, the narrator expresses doubts about his worthiness for such a perilous journey. Virgil, perceiving his fear, reveals that a blessed lady named Beatrice descended from heaven to Limbo, where Virgil resides, to ask for his help. Beatrice explained that she is immune to Hell's torments and was sent by a grieving blessed dame (implied to be the Virgin Mary), who in turn called Lucia to intercede. Lucia then urged Beatrice to help the narrator, who was struggling in a ""torrent flood"" of death. Virgil, having saved the narrator from the she-wolf, encourages him to overcome his fear, as divine aid ensures his safety. Reassured, the narrator renews his resolve, and they proceed.

They arrive at a gate inscribed with words of woe, including ""All hope abandon ye who enter here."" Inside, they hear a cacophony of lamentations. Virgil explains these are the souls of the indifferent, those who lived without praise or blame, mixed with angels who were neither for God nor against Him. They are stung by wasps and hornets, their blood and tears feeding worms. Further on, they reach the river Acheron, where Charon, the ferryman, initially refuses to take the living narrator. Virgil silences Charon by stating their journey is divinely willed. The spirits, upon hearing their doom, blaspheme and are forced into Charon's boat. A violent earthquake and a vermilion flame cause the narrator to faint.

The narrator awakens to thunder and finds himself on the brink of the first circle, Limbo. Virgil, pale with pity, explains that these souls, including himself, are blameless but unbaptized, living in eternal desire without hope. He recounts how Christ once descended here to take Adam, Abel, Noah, Moses, Abraham, David, and others to salvation. They then approach a luminous castle where renowned figures reside. The narrator is greeted by Homer, Horace, Ovid, and Lucan, who welcome him as the sixth in their company. They enter the castle, a verdant mead, where the narrator sees heroes like Hector, Aeneas, Caesar, and philosophers like Aristotle, Socrates, and Plato. Leaving this serene place, they descend into a storm-vexed, lightless climate.

In the second circle, Minos, a monstrous judge, assigns each lustful sinner to their torment by coiling his tail. He tries to bar the narrator, but Virgil again asserts divine will. They enter a place of ceaseless tempest, where carnal sinners are whirled and dashed by violent winds, lamenting their fate. Virgil points out famous lovers and queens, including Semiramis, Dido, Cleopatra, Helen, Achilles, Paris, and Tristan. The narrator, overcome with pity, asks to speak to two spirits. Francesca da Rimini recounts how she and her lover, Paolo, were entangled by love while reading about Lancelot, leading to their shared death. Her story and Paolo's wailing cause the narrator to faint.

Reviving in the third circle, the narrator finds himself in a cold, ceaseless shower of hail, discolored water, and sleet, which makes the ground stink. Cerberus, a three-headed dog, tears at the gluttonous spirits. Virgil silences the monster by throwing dirt into its mouths. One spirit, Ciacco, a Florentine, recognizes the narrator and laments his city's division, avarice, envy, and pride, prophesying future strife and the exile of the narrator's party. He asks to be remembered in the world above. Virgil explains that these souls will resume their bodies after the Last Judgment, feeling their torments more acutely. They then descend to the fourth circle, guarded by Plutus.

Plutus, the demon of wealth, cries out, but Virgil silences him. They descend to the fourth ledge, where hoarders and spendthrifts clash huge weights, eternally accusing each other. Virgil explains that their ignoble lives make them indiscernible. He then expounds on Fortune, a divine minister who justly distributes worldly goods. They descend further to the Stygian lake, where the wrathful, naked and miry, tear at each other. Beneath the surface, the sullen sigh, their grief bubbling the water. They reach the base of a tower.

At the tower, they see signal fires answered from afar. Phlegyas, the ferryman of the Styx, approaches in a bark. He questions the narrator's presence, but Virgil again asserts divine will. As they cross the slimy lake, a soul, Filippo Argenti, rises from the mire and confronts the narrator. The narrator, with Virgil's approval, disdains him, and other wrathful spirits tear Argenti apart. They approach the iron walls of the city of Dis, guarded by fallen angels who refuse them entry. Virgil reassures the terrified narrator, stating that divine aid is coming.

While waiting, the narrator sees three hellish Furies, with serpents for hair, on the tower, who call for Medusa to turn him to stone. Virgil quickly covers the narrator's eyes. A heavenly messenger arrives, walking dry-footed over the Styx. He rebukes the demons, touches the gate with a wand, and it flies open. They enter the city of Dis, finding a wide space filled with burning sepulchres. Virgil explains these contain arch-heretics, particularly Epicureans who denied the soul's immortality.

They walk between the tombs, and the narrator asks if the spirits can be seen. Virgil says they can, and that Farinata, a Florentine Ghibelline, will appear. Farinata rises from his tomb, scornfully asking about the narrator's ancestors. The narrator reveals his Guelf lineage, and they exchange words about their families' exiles. Another spirit, Cavalcante, rises, asking why his son, Guido, is not with the narrator. Misinterpreting the narrator's past tense, Cavalcante believes his son is dead and falls back into his tomb. Farinata, unmoved, prophesies the narrator's own exile and explains that the damned see the future but not the present. The narrator, remorseful, asks Farinata to tell Cavalcante his son is alive. Virgil then leads him away, explaining the structure of the lower circles, which punish violence and fraud.

They reach a precipice guarded by the Minotaur, which Virgil subdues. They descend into the seventh circle, where the violent are punished. The first ring is a river of boiling blood, Phlegethon, in which those who committed violence against their neighbors (tyrants, murderers) are immersed. Centaurs patrol the banks, shooting arrows at any who rise too high. Chiron, the chief Centaur, assigns Nessus to guide them. Nessus points out famous tyrants like Alexander, Dionysius, and Attila.

Next, they enter a dark, thorny forest, the second ring, where suicides are transformed into grier-trees, their leaves devoured by Harpies. The narrator breaks a twig, and the tree cries out, revealing itself as Pier della Vigna, a loyal servant of Frederick II who committed suicide after being falsely accused by envious courtiers. He asks the narrator to clear his name. They then witness two profligate spirits, Lano and Giacomo da Sant' Andrea, fleeing from black mastiffs, who tear one apart and drag his limbs away. Another suicide, from Florence, laments his city and confesses to hanging himself.

They emerge onto a plain of burning sand, the third ring, where those violent against God, nature, and art are punished by a slow rain of fire. Some lie supine, some crouch, others wander. The narrator sees Capaneus, a king who defied Jove, still proud in death. Virgil explains the origin of Hell's rivers from the tears of a colossal statue on Crete. They walk along the banks of a crimson brook, which quenches the flames above it.

They continue along the protected bank. They encounter Brunetto Latini, the narrator's former teacher, among those punished for unnatural vice. Brunetto prophesies the narrator's future fame and his eventual exile from Florence, warning him against his fellow citizens. The narrator expresses deep affection for Brunetto, remembering his teachings. Brunetto names other learned men sharing his fate and then speeds away.

They reach a waterfall, and the narrator, at Virgil's command, removes a cord from his waist. Virgil casts it into the abyss, summoning a monstrous figure. Geryon, the ""image vile of fraud,"" appears, with the face of a just man, a serpent's body, and a scorpion's tail. Virgil instructs the narrator to speak briefly with usurers, who sit on the burning sand, their eyes fixed on purses hanging from their necks, emblazoned with their family crests. The narrator sees various crests and hears one usurer foretell the arrival of a fellow Paduan.

The narrator returns to Virgil, who is already mounted on Geryon. Terrified, the narrator climbs aboard, and Virgil embraces him for safety. Geryon slowly descends into the eighth circle, Malebolge, a vast, rocky chasm divided into ten concentric trenches, connected by bridges.

In the first trench, panders and seducers are scourged by horned demons. The narrator recognizes Venedico Caccianemico, who admits to prostituting his sister, and Jason, who deceived Hypsipyle. In the second trench, flatterers are immersed in ordure. The narrator recognizes Alessio Interminei and Thais.

The third trench punishes simoniacs, who are inverted in rock holes, with flames burning their feet. The narrator speaks to Pope Nicholas III, who mistakes him for Pope Boniface VIII, prophesying Boniface's damnation and the arrival of Clement V. The narrator vehemently condemns the corruption of the papacy, blaming Constantine's donation. Virgil, pleased, carries the narrator to the next bridge.

The fourth trench holds diviners and sorcerers, whose heads are twisted backward on their bodies, forcing them to walk with their faces towards their backs. The narrator weeps at their distorted forms. Virgil identifies Amphiaraus, Tiresias, Aruns, and Manto, recounting the founding of Mantua.

In the fifth trench, barrators (corrupt public officials) are immersed in a lake of boiling pitch, guarded by a troop of grotesque demons called Malebranche, led by Malacoda. One demon brings a sinner from Lucca, who is tormented with hooks. Virgil, asserting divine authority, parleys with Malacoda, who claims a bridge is broken and assigns ten demons to escort them to an alternative path. The narrator is fearful of the demons, but Virgil reassures him.

As they proceed, the Navarrese barrator tricks the demons by promising to summon more spirits if they retreat from the pitch. He then leaps to freedom, causing two demons, Alichino and Calcabrina, to fight and fall into the boiling tar. Virgil and the narrator escape the ensuing chaos.

They flee the Malebranche and descend into the sixth trench, where hypocrites walk slowly, burdened by heavy leaden cloaks that are gilded on the outside. The narrator speaks to two Bolognese ""joyous friars,"" Catalano and Loderingo, who were sent to Florence to keep peace but caused further strife. They point out Caiaphas, the high priest who advised the crucifixion of Christ, crucified naked to the ground and trampled by all who pass. Virgil, realizing Malacoda lied about the broken bridge, is angered.

They climb over the ruined bridge into the seventh trench, a valley filled with venomous serpents. Thieves are tormented here, constantly transforming into serpents and back into human form. An adder transfixes Vanni Fucci, a Florentine thief, who burns to ashes and then instantly reforms. Vanni Fucci defiantly curses God and prophesies Florence's future woes. A furious Centaur, Cacus, with a fire-breathing dragon on his back, pursues him. The narrator witnesses further transformations: one spirit merges with a six-footed serpent, another is pierced by an adder and exchanges forms with it, becoming a serpent while the adder becomes a man.

In the eighth trench, the narrator sees countless flames, each containing a fraudulent counselor. He asks about a flame divided at the top. Virgil identifies it as Ulysses and Diomede, punished together for their shared deceptions, such as the Trojan Horse. Ulysses recounts his final, fatal voyage beyond the Pillars of Hercules, driven by an insatiable desire for knowledge, which ended in shipwreck near the mountain of Purgatory. Another flame contains Guido da Montefeltro, who recounts how Pope Boniface VIII, promising absolution, persuaded him to give treacherous counsel to conquer Penestrino. Upon his death, a dark cherub claimed his soul, arguing that one cannot repent and will a sin simultaneously.

The ninth trench punishes sowers of discord. They are hideously mutilated by a demon with a sword, their wounds healing only to be reopened each time they complete a circuit. The narrator sees Mohammed, cleft from chin to groin, and Ali, his face split. Mohammed warns the narrator to tell Dolcino to prepare for siege. Piero da Medicina, with his throat slit, prophesies the treacherous deaths of two noblemen from Fano. Mosca dei Lamberti, with severed hands, laments his counsel that led to civil strife in Florence. Finally, the narrator sees Bertrand de Born, a knight who incited discord between King Henry II and his son, carrying his severed head like a lantern, his brain separated from his body as he separated father and son.

The narrator is overcome by the sight, but Virgil urges him on, reminding him of their limited time. The narrator mentions his kinsman, Geri del Bello, among the sowers of discord, whose unavenged death made him contemptuous. They reach the tenth and final trench of Malebolge, where various types of falsifiers are punished by loathsome diseases. Alchemists and counterfeiters are afflicted with leprosy and dropsy. The narrator speaks to Griffolino d'Arezzo, an alchemist, and Capocchio, who imitated nature. He then encounters Master Adamo, a counterfeiter suffering from dropsy, who craves water and laments his crime. Adamo points out Sinon, the Greek who deceived the Trojans, and Potiphar's wife, both suffering from burning fever. Adamo and Sinon engage in a bitter verbal exchange, which Virgil sharply rebukes the narrator for listening to.

They leave Malebolge and descend into the deepest part of Hell, Cocytus, a frozen lake. The narrator hears a mighty horn blast, which Virgil explains is blown by a giant. They see several giants, immersed from the navel down, encircling the abyss like towers. Virgil identifies Nimrod, the builder of the Tower of Babel, whose unintelligible language is his punishment. Next is Ephialtes, who rebelled against Jove, now bound in chains. Finally, they reach Antaeus, who is unfettered. Virgil persuades Antaeus to lower them into the lowest depth, promising him fame in the living world. Antaeus gently places them on the ice.

They are now in Cocytus, a vast frozen lake where traitors are immersed in ice. The narrator sees souls frozen in various positions, some with only their heads visible, others completely submerged. In Caina, traitors to kin, he sees the Alberti brothers, frozen together, and Camiscion de' Pazzi, who awaits his kinsman Carlino. In Antenora, traitors to country, the narrator accidentally kicks Bocca degli Abati, who refuses to identify himself until another spirit reveals his name. Bocca then points out other traitors, including Buoso da Duera and Beccaria.

They move to Ptolomea, where traitors to guests are frozen. The narrator sees Count Ugolino gnawing on the head of Archbishop Ruggieri. Ugolino recounts how Ruggieri imprisoned him and his sons in a tower, starving them to death. He describes his agony as his sons offered their own flesh, and how ""fasting got the mastery of grief,"" implying he resorted to cannibalism. The narrator curses Pisa for its cruelty. They then encounter Friar Alberigo, who explains that in Ptolomea, souls fall to Hell the moment they commit treachery, leaving their bodies possessed by demons on Earth. He points out Branca Doria, whose soul is here while his body still lives. The narrator refuses to open Alberigo's frozen eyes, deeming such cruelty appropriate.

Finally, Virgil announces the approach of ""Hell's Monarch."" The narrator sees Lucifer (Dis), a colossal figure frozen mid-breast in the ice, with three faces (red, wan/yellow, and black) and enormous bat-like wings that generate the freezing winds of Cocytus. From his six eyes, he weeps tears mixed with bloody foam. In each of his three mouths, he chews a sinner. Virgil identifies the central one, suffering the most, as Judas Iscariot, head within and feet without. The other two are Brutus and Cassius, traitors to Caesar.

As night re-ascends, Virgil instructs the narrator to cling to him. He climbs down Lucifer's shaggy sides, then, at the point where Lucifer's thigh turns, he inverts himself, climbing upwards as if returning to Hell. Virgil explains they have passed the center of the Earth and are now in the opposite hemisphere. Lucifer's fall from heaven caused the earth to recoil, forming the vacant space they are now in. They follow a hidden path, guided by a brooklet, climbing upward until they emerge through a circular opening. They finally behold the stars once more."
The Great Gatsby-F. Scott Fitzgerald,"The story is narrated by Nick Carraway, who moves from the Middle West to West Egg, Long Island, in the spring of 1922 to work in the bond business. He rents a small house situated between two enormous mansions, one of which belongs to the mysterious Jay Gatsby.

Nick visits his second cousin, Daisy Buchanan, and her wealthy husband, Tom Buchanan, at their elaborate Georgian Colonial mansion in fashionable East Egg. Tom is a physically imposing and arrogant man. Daisy is charming but cynical. At dinner, Nick meets Jordan Baker, a professional golfer. During the evening, the telephone rings, and Miss Baker reveals to Nick that Tom has a mistress in New York. Daisy is aware of this, showing a strained gaiety. Later, Daisy confides in Nick about her unhappiness and cynicism, expressing a wish for her young daughter to be a ""beautiful little fool."" As Nick leaves, he sees Gatsby standing alone on his lawn, stretching his arms towards a distant green light across the bay.

Some time later, Tom takes Nick to the ""valley of ashes,"" a desolate industrial area, where they stop at a garage owned by George B. Wilson. Tom introduces Nick to Wilson's wife, Myrtle, who is Tom's mistress. Myrtle is a vital, sensuous woman in her mid-thirties. Tom arranges to meet Myrtle on the next train to New York. In the city, Tom, Myrtle, and Nick go to an apartment Tom keeps for Myrtle. Myrtle changes into an elaborate dress, and her personality becomes more affected. They are joined by Myrtle's sister, Catherine, and a couple named Mr. and Mrs. McKee. During the party, Catherine tells Nick that neither Tom nor Myrtle can stand their spouses and that Tom's wife, Daisy, is Catholic and doesn't believe in divorce, preventing Tom and Myrtle from marrying. Myrtle recounts her first meeting with Tom on a train. As the night progresses, fueled by alcohol, Myrtle repeatedly shouts Daisy's name, provoking Tom to violently break her nose with his open hand. Nick, disgusted, leaves with Mr. McKee.

Nick begins to attend Gatsby's lavish parties, which are frequent and open to many uninvited guests. He receives a formal invitation to one such party. At the party, Nick feels out of place until he finds Jordan Baker. They discuss rumors about Gatsby, including that he killed a man or was a German spy. Nick eventually meets Gatsby, who is younger than expected, with an ""extraordinary gift for hope."" Gatsby asks to speak to Jordan alone. Later, Jordan reveals to Nick that Gatsby told her he was an Oxford man, though she doubts it. The party ends chaotically with a car accident involving a drunk guest, ""Owl Eyes,"" who was not driving the car.

Gatsby invites Nick to lunch. During the drive to the city in Gatsby's opulent car, Gatsby attempts to tell Nick about his past: being the son of wealthy Midwesterners (from San Francisco), educated at Oxford, and a decorated war hero. He shows Nick a medal from Montenegro and an old Oxford photograph as proof. Gatsby then reveals he has a ""big request"" and wants Nick to arrange a tea meeting with Daisy. Nick is annoyed that Gatsby is using Jordan as an intermediary. In the city, Gatsby introduces Nick to Meyer Wolfshiem, a Jewish man with cuff buttons made of human molars, who Gatsby reveals fixed the 1919 World's Series. Wolfshiem speaks highly of Gatsby, claiming to have ""made him."" Tom Buchanan briefly appears, and Gatsby quickly disappears, avoiding him.

Jordan then tells Nick the full story of Gatsby and Daisy. In 1917, Daisy Fay, a popular young woman in Louisville, was in love with Lieutenant Jay Gatsby. Jordan witnessed their intense connection. However, Gatsby went to war, and Daisy, under pressure, married the wealthy Tom Buchanan in 1919, receiving a $350,000 pearl necklace the day before the wedding. Daisy was drunk and almost called off the wedding after receiving a letter, but ultimately went through with it. A week after their honeymoon, Tom was involved in a car accident with a chambermaid, breaking her arm, which made the papers. Jordan explains that Gatsby bought his mansion in West Egg specifically to be across the bay from Daisy, hoping she would wander into one of his parties. He wants Nick to invite Daisy to tea so he can ""come over"" to Nick's house and see her. Nick agrees to arrange the meeting.

Nick calls Daisy and invites her to tea, specifically telling her not to bring Tom. On the day of the tea, which is rainy, Gatsby sends a gardener to cut Nick's grass and a greenhouse full of flowers to decorate Nick's house. Gatsby arrives, extremely nervous and pale. Daisy arrives, and the reunion is initially awkward and strained. Gatsby nearly knocks over a clock. After a moment of intense embarrassment, Gatsby and Daisy's joy at seeing each other becomes apparent. Gatsby invites Daisy and Nick to his mansion, where he shows Daisy his extravagant home and his extensive collection of expensive clothes. Daisy is overwhelmed and cries into a pile of his shirts, lamenting their beauty. Gatsby points out the green light at the end of Daisy's dock, revealing its profound significance to him as a symbol of his dream. Klipspringer, a ""boarder"" who lives at Gatsby's, is called upon to play the piano. Gatsby and Daisy become completely absorbed in each other, and Nick leaves them alone.

Gatsby stops throwing his large parties, dismissing his old servants and replacing them with people connected to Wolfshiem to prevent gossip, as Daisy now visits frequently in the afternoons. Daisy invites Nick and Jordan to lunch at her house. On a very hot day, Gatsby, Nick, Jordan, and Tom gather at the Buchanan's. Tom receives a phone call, which Jordan whispers is from Tom's mistress. Daisy openly kisses Gatsby when Tom leaves the room. Daisy's young daughter, Pammy, is brought in, and Gatsby appears surprised by her existence. Daisy tells Gatsby he looks ""cool,"" and Tom, observing their interaction, realizes their affair. Tom insists they all go to town. Gatsby suggests they take his car, but Tom insists on driving Gatsby's car with Jordan and Nick, while Daisy rides with Gatsby in Tom's coupé.

On the way to the city, Tom, driving Gatsby's car, expresses his suspicions about Gatsby, questioning his ""Oxford man"" claim and revealing he's investigated Gatsby's business, accusing him of selling illegal alcohol through drugstores. They stop for gas at Wilson's garage. George Wilson is visibly sick and distraught, revealing he has discovered Myrtle's infidelity and plans to move West with her. Myrtle, from an upstairs window, sees Tom in Gatsby's yellow car and mistakenly believes Jordan Baker is Tom's wife, looking at her with ""jealous terror.""

At the Plaza Hotel in New York, a tense confrontation erupts. Tom aggressively questions Gatsby about his relationship with Daisy. Gatsby declares that Daisy never loved Tom and has always loved him. Daisy, under pressure, initially confirms she never loved Tom, but then admits she did love him ""once,"" though she loves Gatsby now. Tom exposes Gatsby's illegal bootlegging operation, accusing him of being a ""common swindler."" Daisy is terrified and withdraws, begging to leave. Tom, asserting his dominance, tells Daisy to go home with Gatsby in Gatsby's car, stating that Gatsby's ""presumptuous little flirtation is over."" Nick, Jordan, and Tom drive back in Tom's coupé. Nick turns thirty that day.

As they drive back through the Valley of Ashes, they encounter a crowd at Wilson's garage. They discover that Myrtle Wilson has been hit and killed by a car. Michaelis, the coffee shop owner, recounts that Wilson had locked Myrtle upstairs, but she escaped, ran into the road, and was struck. Tom, seeing the yellow car, immediately tells Wilson that it wasn't his car and he just arrived from New York, implying Gatsby was driving. Later, Gatsby confesses to Nick that Daisy was driving the car, but he will take the blame. Gatsby waits outside Daisy's house all night, watching over her, but observes Tom and Daisy sitting together at the kitchen table, talking intimately and appearing to conspire.

The next morning, Nick goes to Gatsby's house. Gatsby is dejected. Nick urges him to go away, as the car will be traced, but Gatsby refuses to leave Daisy. Gatsby tells Nick the true story of his past: he was a penniless officer who fell in love with Daisy, making her believe he was from the same social strata and could care for her. He felt committed to her, pursuing her as a ""grail."" After the war, he was sent to Oxford, and Daisy, feeling the pressure of the world, married Tom. Gatsby returns to his house. The gardener asks to drain the pool as autumn approaches, but Gatsby asks him to wait, remarking he never used it all summer. Nick leaves for the city, but before he goes, he shouts to Gatsby that he is ""worth the whole damn bunch put together.""

Gatsby's father, Henry C. Gatz, arrives from Minnesota, having seen news of his son's death in the Chicago newspaper. He is grief-stricken but also immensely proud of ""Jimmy's"" success, showing Nick a photograph of Gatsby's mansion and a boyhood schedule of self-improvement. Nick tries to arrange a funeral. He calls Klipspringer, the ""boarder,"" who refuses to attend, only calling to retrieve a pair of tennis shoes he left at Gatsby's. Nick also visits Meyer Wolfshiem, who also refuses to attend, stating his policy of not getting involved in such matters when a friend is killed. Nick receives a call from a man named Slagle, who mentions ""Young Parke"" being caught for bond fraud, implying Gatsby's illegal business connections. Nick informs him of Gatsby's death, and the call is abruptly disconnected.

The funeral is attended only by Nick, Mr. Gatz, the ""owl-eyed"" man from Gatsby's library, a few servants, and the postman. Daisy and Tom have left without leaving a forwarding address. Catherine, Myrtle's sister, lies at the inquest, denying any knowledge of Gatsby or Myrtle's affair to simplify the case, portraying Wilson as ""deranged by grief.""

Before leaving the East, Nick breaks off his relationship with Jordan Baker. She reveals she is engaged to another man and accuses Nick of being careless. Nick later encounters Tom Buchanan on Fifth Avenue. Tom admits he told Wilson that Gatsby owned the yellow car, justifying it by saying Gatsby ""had it coming"" and accusing Gatsby of running over Myrtle. Nick realizes that Tom and Daisy are ""careless people"" who ""smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made."" Nick shakes Tom's hand, feeling as though he's talking to a child.

Nick decides to return to the Middle West, feeling that the East is haunted and distorted. He reflects on Gatsby's unwavering dream and his belief in the ""green light,"" the future that always recedes. He concludes that people ""beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past."""
The Iliad-Homer,"The plot of the provided text, ""The Iliad,"" begins in the tenth year of the Trojan War.

**The Contention of Achilles and Agamemnon (Book I)**
The Greeks, having sacked neighboring towns, captured two beautiful women: Chryseïs, allotted to Agamemnon, and Briseïs, allotted to Achilles. Chryses, a priest of Apollo and father of Chryseïs, comes to the Greek camp to ransom his daughter. Agamemnon insolently refuses and dismisses him. Chryses prays to Apollo for vengeance, and Apollo inflicts a pestilence on the Greeks. Achilles calls a council, where the prophet Chalcas reveals that Agamemnon's refusal to return Chryseïs is the cause. Agamemnon is forced to return Chryseïs to appease Apollo but, in a fit of rage, seizes Briseïs from Achilles as compensation. Enraged and dishonored, Achilles withdraws himself and his Myrmidon forces from the war. He complains to his mother, Thetis, who supplicates Jupiter to grant victory to the Trojans, making the Greeks realize their mistake in offending her son. Jupiter grants her request, which incenses Juno. A heated debate ensues between Jupiter and Juno, eventually pacified by Vulcan.

**The Trial of the Army and Catalogue of Forces (Book II)**
To fulfill his promise to Thetis, Jupiter sends a deceitful dream to Agamemnon, urging him to lead the Greeks into battle, promising Troy's immediate fall. Agamemnon, though deluded, decides to test the army's morale by proposing a return to Greece. He calls a council of princes, where Nestor supports the idea of following the divine message. Agamemnon then addresses the assembled army, suggesting they abandon the siege. The troops, weary after nine years of war, unanimously agree and rush to prepare their ships for departure. Juno, observing this, sends Minerva to intervene. Minerva finds Ulysses and instructs him to rally the Greeks. Ulysses, wielding Agamemnon's sceptre, persuades the leaders and physically chastises the common soldiers, notably beating the insolent Thersites for publicly reviling Agamemnon and Achilles. Ulysses reminds the Greeks of Chalcas' prophecy about Troy's fall in the tenth year. Nestor then advises Agamemnon to organize the troops by nations. Agamemnon agrees, sacrifices a steer to Jupiter (who secretly rejects his prayer for Troy's fall), and the Greeks prepare for battle. The text then provides a detailed catalogue of the Greek forces and their leaders. Iris, sent by Jupiter, warns Priam of the approaching Greek army, disguised as Polites. Hector, the Trojan leader, rallies his own forces, and a detailed catalogue of the Trojan and auxiliary forces is given.

**The Duel of Menelaus and Paris (Book III)**
The armies advance. Paris, in the Trojan front, challenges any Greek to single combat. Menelaus, seeing Paris, eagerly accepts. Paris, however, retreats in fear. Hector upbraids Paris for his cowardice. Paris, stung by the rebuke, proposes a duel between himself and Menelaus to decide the war, with Helen and her treasures as the prize. Hector announces this to both armies. Menelaus accepts, demanding Priam swear the oath due to his sons' faithlessness. Priam, Agamemnon, and Ulysses swear the oaths, sacrificing lambs. Priam returns to Troy, unable to watch. Paris and Menelaus arm themselves. Paris throws his spear, which strikes Menelaus' shield but fails to pierce it. Menelaus throws his spear, piercing Paris' shield and corslet, grazing his flank. Menelaus then strikes Paris' helmet with his sword, which breaks. Menelaus seizes Paris by the helmet crest and begins to drag him. Venus intervenes, breaking the helmet strap and whisking Paris away in a cloud to his chamber in Troy. Menelaus searches for Paris in vain. Venus, disguised, then brings a reluctant Helen to Paris, who dismisses her reproaches and embraces her. Agamemnon declares Menelaus the victor and demands the return of Helen and the payment of a fine.

**The Breach of the Truce, and the First Battle (Book IV)**
The gods in council debate the war's continuation. Jupiter, after provoking Juno, allows Minerva to break the truce. Minerva, disguised as Laodocus, persuades Pandarus to shoot an arrow at Menelaus. Pandarus wounds Menelaus. Agamemnon and Menelaus lament the broken truce. The physician Machaon extracts the arrow and heals Menelaus. Agamemnon rallies the Greek troops, praising brave leaders like Idomeneus and the Ajaxes, and reproving those who hesitate. Nestor advises on battle formations. Diomed is reproved by Agamemnon but prepares for battle. The general battle begins fiercely. Antilochus kills Echepolus. Ajax (Telamonian) kills Simoisius. Ulysses kills Democoon. Hector rallies the Trojans, while Apollo encourages them and Minerva inspires the Greeks. Pyrus kills Diores, and Thoas kills Pyrus. The battle rages with many casualties on both sides.

**The Acts of Diomed (Book V)**
Minerva inspires Diomed, making him shine with divine light and granting him immense strength. He kills Phegeus and would have killed Idæus, but Vulcan saves Idæus. Minerva and Mars briefly withdraw from the battle. Diomed continues his rampage, killing many Trojans. Pandarus wounds Diomed with an arrow. Minerva cures Diomed, gives him the ability to distinguish gods from mortals, and instructs him to fight only Venus among the gods. Diomed returns to battle. Æneas, seeing Diomed's fury, persuades Pandarus to join him in his chariot to face Diomed. Diomed, after a warning from Sthenelus, refuses to retreat. Pandarus throws his spear, which hits Diomed's shield. Diomed, guided by Minerva, kills Pandarus with his spear. Æneas defends Pandarus' body. Diomed throws a massive stone, wounding Æneas in the hip. Venus saves her son Æneas, covering him with her veil. Diomed, recognizing Venus, pursues and wounds her hand. Venus, shrieking, drops Æneas. Apollo takes Æneas, covers him in a cloud, and carries him to Troy for healing. Diomed insults Venus. Iris helps Venus to Mars, who is sitting apart. Venus complains to Dione, her mother, about Diomed's attack. Dione comforts her, reminding her that gods also suffer from mortals. Juno and Pallas mock Venus. Jupiter tells Venus to stick to love. Apollo heals Æneas and creates a phantom of him to keep the Trojans fighting. Apollo urges Mars to rally the Trojans. Sarpedon upbraids Hector for his inaction. Hector, stung, rallies his troops, and Mars joins the Trojan side. Agamemnon rallies the Greeks. Diomed kills Deicoon. Æneas kills Orsilochus and Crethon. Menelaus and Antilochus retrieve their bodies. Menelaus kills Pylæmenes. Antilochus kills Mydon. Hector charges, and Diomed, seeing Mars with Hector, advises a tactical retreat. Hector kills Anchialus and Mnesthes. Ajax (Telamonian) kills Amphius. Tlepolemus challenges Sarpedon. They exchange boasts and spears; Sarpedon kills Tlepolemus, but Tlepolemus wounds Sarpedon. Ulysses kills several Lycians. Hector drives the Greeks back. Sarpedon is carried off wounded. Juno and Minerva descend in a chariot to aid the Greeks. Juno, in Stentor's voice, rallies the Greeks. Minerva reproaches Diomed for his hesitation and tells him to fight Mars. Minerva and Diomed mount the chariot. Minerva guides Diomed's spear, which wounds Mars in the groin. Mars bellows in pain and flees to Olympus. Jupiter rebukes Mars but has Pæon heal him. Juno and Pallas return to Olympus.

**The Episodes of Glaucus and Diomed, and of Hector and Andromache (Book VI)**
With the gods withdrawn, the Greeks gain the upper hand. Many Trojans are slain by various Greek heroes. Menelaus captures Adrastus and, urged by Agamemnon, kills him despite his plea for ransom. Helenus, Troy's chief augur, advises Hector to rally the troops and then return to Troy to instruct Hecuba and the Trojan matrons to offer a sacred mantle and twelve heifers to Minerva, praying for Diomed's removal from battle. Hector complies. Glaucus and Diomed meet between the armies. They discover their grandfathers were guest-friends and agree not to fight each other, exchanging armor (Glaucus foolishly exchanges his golden armor for Diomed's bronze). Hector arrives in Troy, where Hecuba offers him wine, but he refuses, instructing her to perform the sacrifice to Minerva. The matrons pray, but Minerva denies their request. Hector then goes to Paris' house, finds him polishing his armor, and reproaches him for his idleness. Paris accepts the rebuke and prepares to return to battle. Helen expresses her self-reproach and wishes she had died. Hector tells Paris he must leave to see his wife and son. Hector finds Andromache and their son Astyanax at the Scaean Gate. Andromache, weeping, pleads with Hector to stay within the city walls, fearing his death and the inevitable fate of their child and Troy. She recounts how Achilles killed her father, mother, and seven brothers. Hector explains his duty to fight for Troy and the shame of cowardice, acknowledging Troy's fated fall and Andromache's future as a captive. He embraces Astyanax, who is frightened by his helmet, and prays to Jupiter for his son's glory. Hector then comforts Andromache, telling her to return to her domestic duties. Hector and Paris, now armed, return to the battlefield.

**The Single Combat of Hector and Ajax (Book VII)**
Hector and Paris rejoin the battle, reinvigorating the Trojan forces. Paris kills Menestheus, Hector kills Eioneus, and Glaucus kills Iphinous. Minerva and Apollo meet and agree to halt the general battle for the day by inspiring Hector to challenge a Greek to single combat. Helenus conveys this divine message to Hector. Hector issues the challenge, proposing that the victor take the loser's spoils, but return the body for burial. The Greeks are initially silent with fear. Menelaus offers to fight but is restrained by Agamemnon, who reminds him of Hector's superior strength. Nestor shames the Greeks for their cowardice, recounting his own youthful valor. Nine Greek chiefs volunteer, and lots are cast. Ajax (Telamonian) wins the lot. Ajax and Hector exchange boasts and then spears. Hector's spear strikes Ajax's shield but does not pierce. Ajax's spear pierces Hector's shield and corslet, grazing his flank. They then throw stones, with Ajax knocking Hector down, though Apollo restores Hector's strength. As they draw swords, heralds intervene, declaring nightfall and stopping the combat. Hector proposes an exchange of gifts as a sign of respect, giving Ajax a sword, and receiving a belt in return. Both return to their armies. The Greeks feast, and Nestor advises building a fortification around their ships and camp. The Trojans hold a council. Antenor proposes returning Helen and her treasures, but Paris refuses to return Helen, though he offers her treasures and additional wealth. Priam suggests sending a herald to the Greeks with Paris's offer and requesting a truce for burning the dead. Idæus delivers the message. Diomed rejects the offer of treasures, insisting on Troy's complete defeat. Agamemnon agrees only to the truce for burial. Both armies burn their dead. The Greeks then build a wall, trench, and palisades around their camp. Neptune complains to Jupiter about this unhallowed construction. Jupiter promises to destroy the wall after Troy's fall. Both armies feast, but Jupiter sends thunder and lightning to dishearten the Trojans.

**The Second Battle, and the Distress of the Greeks (Book VIII)**
Jupiter convenes the gods, forbidding any intervention in the battle, threatening Tartarus for disobedience. Minerva obtains permission to offer advice, not direct aid. Jupiter goes to Mount Ida, where he weighs the fates of Greece and Troy; the Greek scale sinks. He sends thunder and lightning, terrifying the Greeks. Nestor's horse is wounded, and Hector nearly kills Nestor, but Diomed rescues him (Ulysses flees). Diomed and Nestor retreat, pursued by Hector. Jupiter sends lightning in front of Diomed's chariot, forcing them to flee. Hector boasts of his impending victory and plans to burn the Greek ships. Juno complains to Neptune, who refuses to defy Jupiter. Hector drives the Greeks back to their fortifications. Agamemnon, inspired by Juno, rallies the Greeks and prays to Jupiter. Jupiter sends an eagle omen, encouraging the Greeks. Diomed leads a renewed charge, killing Agelaus. Teucer, protected by Ajax's shield, shoots arrows, killing several Trojans. Agamemnon praises Teucer. Teucer shoots at Hector, misses, but kills Gorgythio (Priam's son) and Archeptolemus (Hector's charioteer). Hector, enraged, kills Teucer with a stone, breaking his bow. Ajax carries Teucer off. Jupiter again favors the Trojans, who push the Greeks back to their wall. Juno and Minerva prepare to intervene, but Jupiter sends Iris to warn them, threatening severe punishment. Juno and Minerva reluctantly return to Olympus. Jupiter returns to Olympus, rebukes the goddesses, and reveals his full plan: Hector will continue to conquer until he sets fire to the ships, then Achilles will return to battle after Patroclus' death, and Hector will die. Night falls, and the victorious Trojans camp on the plain, lighting many fires, to prevent the Greeks' escape. Hector orders them to keep watch and prepare for a final assault at dawn.

**The Embassy to Achilles (Book IX)**
The Greeks are gripped by fear. Agamemnon, weeping, proposes abandoning the siege. Diomed vehemently opposes this, vowing to fight on. Nestor praises Diomed and advises Agamemnon to strengthen the guards and send an embassy to appease Achilles. Agamemnon agrees, admitting his fault, and offers Achilles immense gifts: gold, tripods, horses, seven Lesbian captives (including Briseïs, whom he swears he never touched), twenty Trojan women after Troy's fall, and his daughter in marriage with seven cities. Nestor selects Phoenix, Ajax, and Ulysses as ambassadors. They find Achilles playing the lyre with Patroclus. Achilles welcomes them. Ulysses presents Agamemnon's offer and pleads with Achilles, reminding him of his father's advice to control his anger. Achilles fiercely rejects the offer, declaring his resentment for Agamemnon's dishonor. He states that he will return home to Phthia and advises the Greeks to do the same. He vows not to fight until Hector's flames threaten his own ships. Phoenix, Achilles' old tutor, recounts his own exile and how he raised Achilles, urging him to temper his rage, citing the example of Meleager. Achilles again rejects the plea. Ajax then reproaches Achilles for his stubborn pride. Achilles replies that Ajax's words are just, but his rage against Agamemnon is too deep. He reiterates his refusal to fight until his own ships are threatened. The ambassadors return to Agamemnon, reporting Achilles' refusal. Diomed encourages the Greeks to prepare for battle without Achilles.

**The Night-Adventure of Diomed and Ulysses (Book X)**
Agamemnon, sleepless with worry, consults Menelaus, then Nestor. Nestor advises sending a spy into the Trojan camp. Diomed volunteers, choosing Ulysses as his companion. They arm themselves. Minerva sends a heron as an omen. Hector, in the Trojan camp, also sends a spy, Dolon, promising him Achilles' horses and chariot as a reward. Diomed and Ulysses capture Dolon. Dolon, begging for his life, reveals the Trojan dispositions, including the recently arrived Thracian king Rhesus, with his magnificent white horses. Diomed kills Dolon. Ulysses dedicates Dolon's spoils to Minerva. They proceed to the Thracian camp, where Diomed kills Rhesus and twelve of his men in their sleep. Ulysses unties Rhesus' white horses and leads them away. Minerva appears to Diomed, urging him to return. They drive the horses back to the Greek camp, retrieving Dolon's spoils on the way. Nestor greets them, and they recount their successful mission. They stable the horses, dedicate Dolon's armor to Minerva, cleanse themselves, and feast.

**The Third Battle, and the Acts of Agamemnon (Book XI)**
Eris, sent by Jove, rouses the Greeks for battle. Agamemnon arms himself in splendid armor and leads the Greeks. Jove sends bloody rain. The Trojans, led by Hector, form their lines. The battle begins. Agamemnon leads a fierce charge, killing many Trojans, including two sons of Priam (Isus and Antiphus) and two sons of Antimachus (Pisander and Hippolochus), refusing ransom for the latter due to their father's past treachery. Agamemnon drives the Trojans back to the city walls. Jove sends Iris to Hector, commanding him to retreat while Agamemnon rages, but to return to battle once Agamemnon is wounded. Hector obeys. Coön wounds Agamemnon in the arm, but Agamemnon kills Coön. Agamemnon, in pain, withdraws from battle. Hector, seeing this, rallies the Trojans and charges, killing many Greeks. Ulysses and Diomed stand firm. Diomed kills Thymbraeus and his charioteer, and the sons of Merops. Paris wounds Diomed in the foot with an arrow. Diomed insults Paris and retreats to the ships. Ulysses is left alone, surrounded by Trojans. He fights bravely, killing several, but is wounded by Socus, whom he then kills. Ulysses calls for aid, and Menelaus and Ajax come to his rescue, driving off the Trojans and helping Ulysses to his chariot. Ajax kills Doryclus, Pandocus, and Lysander. Paris wounds Machaon with an arrow. Idomeneus tells Nestor to take Machaon to the ships for healing. Nestor takes Machaon. Cebriones, Hector's charioteer, points out Ajax's success. Hector charges Ajax. Jove fills Ajax with terror, causing him to retreat slowly. Eurypylus aids Ajax but is wounded by Paris. Patroclus, seeing Nestor with Machaon, asks Achilles who is wounded. Achilles sends Patroclus to Nestor's tent to inquire. Nestor recounts the many wounded Greek chiefs and urges Patroclus to persuade Achilles to fight, or at least to lead the Myrmidons in Achilles' armor. Patroclus, on his way back, meets the wounded Eurypylus and helps him to his tent, extracting the arrow and applying balm.

**The Battle at the Grecian Wall (Book XII)**
While Patroclus tends to Eurypylus, the battle continues at the Greek fortifications. The narrator explains that the Greek wall, built without divine offerings, is destined for destruction. Hector leads the Trojans against the wall. Polydamas advises Hector to dismount and attack the wall on foot, dividing the army into five battalions. Hector agrees, but Asius disobeys and drives his chariot to the gates, where he is repulsed by Polypoetes and Leonteus. An omen appears: an eagle carrying a bleeding serpent, which drops it among the Trojans. Polydamas interprets this as a sign that they will breach the wall but fail to take the ships. Hector rejects this advice, insisting on Jove's favor. Hector rallies his troops, and Jove sends a whirlwind to aid them. The Trojans attack the wall. Sarpedon, inspired by Jove, leads his Lycians against a section of the wall, encouraging Glaucus with a speech about their noble lineage. Menestheus calls for aid from the Ajaces and Teucer. Ajax (Telamonian) kills Epicles with a stone. Teucer wounds Glaucus with an arrow. Sarpedon, enraged, kills Alcmaon and then breaches the wall. Teucer and Ajax try to stop him, but Jove protects Sarpedon. Hector, with Jove's aid, heaves a massive stone and smashes through the main gates. Hector rushes through the breach, followed by the Trojans, driving the Greeks back to their ships.

**The Fourth Battle Continued, in Which Neptune Assists the Greeks: The Acts of Idomeneus (Book XIII)**
Jupiter, having given the Trojans an advantage, turns his attention away from the battle. Neptune, seeing the Greek distress, emerges from the sea, disguised as Calchas, and inspires the Ajaces and other Greek leaders with renewed courage. The Ajaces feel the divine inspiration and are eager to fight Hector. Neptune rallies the Greeks, shaming them for their retreat. The Greeks form a phalanx. Hector charges. Merion's spear breaks on Deiphobus' shield. Teucer kills Imbrius. Hector throws a spear at Teucer, missing him but killing Amphimachus (Neptune's grandson).

Hector agrees, but first goes to rally Paris, whom he reproaches. Paris explains that Helenus and Deiphobus are wounded. Hector, appeased, returns to the center and confronts Ajax again.

**Juno Deceives Jupiter by the Girdle of Venus (Book XIV)**
Nestor, seeing the Greek wall breached and the Greeks fleeing, leaves Machaon and meets the wounded Agamemnon, Ulysses, and Diomed. Agamemnon proposes abandoning the siege. Ulysses vehemently opposes this. Diomed advises the wounded kings to return to the front to encourage the troops, staying out of harm's way. They follow this advice. Neptune, disguised, encourages Agamemnon and then shouts, inspiring the Greeks. Juno, seeing Jupiter on Ida favoring the Trojans, plans to deceive him. She adorns herself and obtains Venus' magic girdle of love and desire. She then persuades Sleep to put Jupiter to sleep, promising him Pasithaë, the youngest Grace, as his wife, and swearing an oath by Styx. Sleep and Juno fly to Ida. Juno seduces Jupiter, who falls asleep. Sleep then informs Neptune that Jupiter is asleep, urging him to aid the Greeks. Neptune rallies the Greeks. Hector throws his spear at Ajax, which is deflected. Ajax throws a huge stone at Hector, knocking him to the ground. Hector is carried off wounded by the Trojans. The Greeks, seeing Hector's retreat, press the attack, killing many Trojans. The Greeks gain ground, driving the Trojans back to the ships.

**The Fifth Battle at the Ships; and the Acts of Ajax (Book XV)**
Jupiter wakes on Ida, sees the Trojans fleeing, Hector wounded, and Neptune aiding the Greeks. He angrily confronts Juno, who swears she did not aid Neptune. Jupiter accepts her word and reveals his plan: Iris will command Neptune to withdraw, Apollo will re-inspire Hector, who will drive the Greeks to their ships. Patroclus will then fight in Achilles' armor, kill Sarpedon, but then be killed by Hector. Only then will Achilles return to battle, and Troy will fall. Juno flies to Olympus and sends Iris and Apollo to Jupiter on Ida. Jupiter commands Iris to tell Neptune to withdraw. Neptune, angry but obedient, retreats to the sea. Jupiter commands Apollo to revive Hector, give him the aegis, and lead the Trojans. Apollo descends, revives Hector, and leads the Trojans, terrifying the Greeks. The Greeks are driven back to their ships. Hector urges the Trojans to fire the ships. Apollo pushes down the Greek wall and fills the trench, creating a path. The Trojans rush to the ships.

**The Sixth Battle, the Acts and Death of Patroclus (Book XVI)**
Patroclus, weeping, approaches Achilles, recounting the Greek distress and urging him to fight or allow him to lead the Myrmidons in Achilles' armor. Achilles agrees, but with strict orders: only drive the Trojans from the ships, do not pursue them to Troy, and do not engage Hector. Achilles wishes all others would perish so he and Patroclus could sack Troy alone. Ajax is overwhelmed, and Hector cuts off his spearhead. Ajax retreats, and Hector sets fire to Protesilaus' ship. Achilles, seeing the flames, tells Patroclus to arm. Patroclus dons Achilles' armor (except for his spear). Automedon harnesses Achilles' immortal horses. Achilles rallies his Myrmidons and pours a libation to Jove, praying for Patroclus' success and safe return (Jove grants the first, denies the second). Patroclus leads the Myrmidons, terrifying the Trojans, who mistake him for Achilles. Patroclus extinguishes the fires and drives the Trojans from the ships, pursuing them across the plain, killing many. Sarpedon challenges Patroclus. Jove debates saving Sarpedon but is persuaded by Juno to let fate take its course. Jove sends a shower of blood. Patroclus kills Thrasymed. Sarpedon's spear wounds Pedasus (Achilles' mortal horse).

Ajax (Telamonian) sees Jove's intervention and suggests sending a messenger to Achilles. Ajax prays to Jove to dispel the darkness. Jove clears the air. Menelaus is sent to find Antilochus to deliver the news to Achilles. Antilochus is shocked and runs to Achilles. Menelaus returns to the battle, telling the Greeks Achilles is unarmed. Menelaus and Merion lift Patroclus' body. Ajax (Telamonian) and Ajax (Oïlean) cover their retreat. The Trojans pursue fiercely, but Ajax holds them off. The Greeks retreat slowly with the body.

**The Grief of Achilles, and New Armour Made Him by Vulcan (Book XVIII)**
Antilochus brings Achilles the news of Patroclus' death and the loss of his armor to Hector. Achilles is overcome with grief, covering himself in ashes, tearing his hair, and groveling. Thetis, his mother, hears his cries and comes with the Nereids. Achilles laments Patroclus' death and vows revenge on Hector, accepting his own fated death that will follow. Thetis promises to get him new armor from Vulcan. Meanwhile, the Greeks struggle to retrieve Patroclus' body. Juno sends Iris to Achilles, urging him to appear at the trench to scare the Trojans. Achilles, though unarmed, agrees. Minerva throws her aegis over him and creates a blazing golden cloud above his head. Achilles shouts from the trench, and his voice, amplified by Minerva, terrifies the Trojans. They retreat in panic, allowing the Greeks to retrieve Patroclus' body. Achilles weeps over the body. The sun sets. The Trojans hold a council. Polydamas advises retreating into the city, fearing Achilles. Hector rejects this, insisting they stay on the plain to press the attack at dawn. Pallas makes the Trojans approve Hector's bad advice. The Greeks mourn Patroclus all night. Achilles vows to sacrifice twelve Trojan captives on Patroclus' pyre and to give Hector's body to dogs. Thetis arrives at Vulcan's palace. Vulcan, recalling Thetis' past kindness, agrees to forge magnificent new armor for Achilles. He creates a wondrous shield depicting the cosmos, two cities (peace and war), agricultural scenes, and a herd attacked by lions. He also forges a cuirass, greaves, and a helmet. Thetis takes the blazing armor and flies back to Achilles.

**The Reconciliation of Achilles and Agamemnon (Book XIX)**
Thetis brings Achilles his new, divine armor. Achilles is filled with rage and fire. He expresses concern about Patroclus' body decaying, but Thetis reassures him, preserving the body with nectar and ambrosia. Achilles calls an assembly of Greeks and publicly renounces his wrath against Agamemnon, stating his grief for Patroclus outweighs all past grievances. He wishes Helen had died to prevent the war. The Greeks cheer. Agamemnon, without rising, blames Jove, Fate, and Ate for his past actions, recounting how Jove himself was once deceived. He reiterates his offer of gifts and swears publicly that he never touched Briseïs. Achilles accepts the gifts but insists on immediate battle. Ulysses advises the troops to eat and rest before fighting, and for Agamemnon to formally present the gifts and swear his oath. Agamemnon agrees. Achilles, still consumed by grief, refuses to eat until he has avenged Patroclus. Jove, pitying Achilles, sends Minerva to infuse ambrosia and nectar into his breast to sustain him. The Greek army arms. Achilles puts on his new armor, blazing like fire. He harnesses his immortal horses. Xanthus, one of the horses, miraculously speaks, prophesying Achilles' imminent death, not by their fault but by divine will. The Furies silence Xanthus. Achilles, undaunted, acknowledges his fate and rushes to battle.

**The Battle of the Gods, and the Acts of Achilles (Book XX)**
Greeks and Trojans prepare for battle. Jupiter calls a council of gods, permitting them to join either side, fearing Achilles might prematurely sack Troy. The gods descend to battle: Juno, Neptune, Minerva, Hermes, Vulcan for Greeks; Latona, Apollo, Mars, Xanthus, Diana for Trojans. The earth and Olympus shake. Apollo encourages Æneas to face Achilles, reminding him of his divine lineage. Æneas, though recalling a past defeat by Achilles, advances. Juno, seeing Æneas, calls a council of Greek-supporting gods. Neptune suggests they observe unless a god directly aids a mortal. Achilles and Æneas confront each other. Achilles reminds Æneas of his past flight. Æneas boasts his lineage and throws his spear, which strikes Achilles' shield. Achilles throws his spear, which passes through Æneas' shield. Achilles draws his sword. Neptune intervenes, casting a mist over Achilles, retrieving his spear, and transporting Æneas to the rear, warning him not to fight Achilles until Achilles' fated death. Achilles, realizing divine intervention, rallies the Greeks. Hector rallies the Trojans. Apollo warns Hector to avoid single combat with Achilles. Achilles charges, killing Iphytion, Demoleon, Hippodamas, and Polydore (Priam's youngest son). Hector, enraged by Polydore's death, charges Achilles. Hector throws his spear, but Pallas deflects it. Achilles charges, but Apollo shrouds Hector in a cloud, saving him. Achilles, furious, kills many more Trojans.

**The Battle in the River Scamander (Book XXI)**
The Trojans flee Achilles, some towards the town, others to the river Xanthus (Scamander). Achilles drives half into the river, killing many with his sword. He takes twelve Trojan youths alive as captives for Patroclus' sacrifice. He encounters Lycaon (Priam's son), whom he had previously captured and sold into slavery. Lycaon begs for his life, but Achilles, hardened by Patroclus' death, refuses mercy and kills him, throwing his body into the river. The river god Xanthus is enraged by the slaughter and choked with bodies. He tells Achilles to cease. Achilles agrees to stop killing in the river but vows to sack Troy and kill Hector. Xanthus swells his waters and attacks Achilles, sweeping him away. Achilles clings to an elm, which is uprooted, but he escapes to land. Xanthus pursues with huge waves. Achilles, exhausted, cries to Jove. Neptune and Pallas appear in human form, encouraging Achilles and promising victory over Hector. Achilles, re-energized, returns to the fight. Xanthus calls to Simois for aid, and the two river gods attack Achilles. Juno, fearing for Achilles, calls to Vulcan for aid. Vulcan unleashes his fires, burning the dead, drying the land, and boiling the river. Xanthus begs Juno to stop Vulcan, promising to desist from aiding Troy. Juno commands Vulcan to cease. The other gods resume fighting: Minerva strikes Mars down. Venus helps Mars away. Minerva strikes Venus. Neptune challenges Apollo, who refuses to fight. Diana upbraids Apollo. Juno seizes Diana, breaking her bow. Latona collects Diana's weapons. Hermes declines to fight Latona. Apollo enters Troy. Achilles continues his slaughter, driving the remaining Trojans towards the city gates. Priam orders the gates opened. Apollo, to save the Trojans, gives strength to Agenor, who faces Achilles. Agenor throws his spear, which strikes Achilles' greave. Achilles charges, but Apollo shrouds Agenor and transports him to safety. Apollo then takes Agenor's form and lures Achilles away from the city, allowing the remaining Trojans to retreat safely into Troy.

**The Death of Hector (Book XXII)**
The Trojans are safe within the walls, except for Hector, who remains outside the Scaean Gate, determined to face Achilles. Apollo, revealing himself, taunts Achilles for pursuing a god. Achilles, angered, rushes towards the city. Priam and Hecuba, from the walls, plead with Hector to come inside, fearing his death. Hector, fixed in his resolve, debates within himself, rejecting Polydamas' advice to retreat due to shame. He dismisses the thought of parleying. Achilles approaches, blazing like a star. Hector's resolve fails, and he flees. Achilles pursues Hector three times around the walls of Troy. The gods observe. Jupiter weighs their fates; Hector's scale sinks. Apollo abandons Hector. Minerva flies to Achilles. Minerva, disguised as Deiphobus (Hector's brother), appears beside Hector, urging him to make a stand. Hector, believing he has an ally, agrees to fight Achilles and proposes an oath to return the victor's body. Achilles furiously rejects any oaths, declaring his intent to kill Hector. Achilles throws his spear, but Hector dodges. Minerva retrieves the spear and returns it to Achilles, unseen by Hector. Hector, thinking he has wounded Achilles, throws his spear, which strikes Achilles' shield but is repelled. Hector calls for Deiphobus' spear, but he is not there. Hector realizes he has been deceived by a god and accepts his fate. Hector draws his sword and charges Achilles. Achilles, knowing the weak point in his own armor (worn by Hector), pierces Hector's neck. Hector falls, dying. Achilles boasts over him. Hector, with his dying breath, begs Achilles to return his body for burial. Achilles fiercely refuses, saying Hector's body will be eaten by dogs and birds. Hector, dying, prophesies Achilles' death at the Scaean Gate by Paris and Apollo. Hector dies. Achilles strips his armor. Other Greeks stab Hector's body. Achilles, in an act of vengeance, pierces Hector's ankles, ties them to his chariot, and drags Hector's body thrice around Patroclus' tomb, then back to his tent. Priam and Hecuba witness this from the walls and lament in despair. Andromache, unaware, hears the wailing, rushes to the walls, sees Hector's body being dragged, and faints. Revived, she laments Hector's death, the future of their son Astyanax, and the fall of Troy. She resolves to burn his clothes as a funeral offering.

**Funeral Games in Honour of Patroclus (Book XXIII)**
Achilles and the Myrmidons mourn Hector. Achilles orders them to drive their chariots thrice around Patroclus' body. Achilles lays his bloody hands on Patroclus' chest, promising Hector's body to dogs and twelve Trojan captives for the pyre. Hector's body is thrown before the bier. Achilles refuses to wash or eat until Patroclus is buried. He instructs Agamemnon to prepare wood for the pyre. The Greeks sleep. Achilles, by the shore, falls asleep. The ghost of Patroclus appears, asking for burial rites and for their bones to be mixed. Achilles tries to embrace the ghost, but it vanishes. Agamemnon sends Merion to Ida to cut wood. The wood is brought back. The Greek army processes around Patroclus' body. Achilles cuts a lock of his hair, vowed to Sperchius, and casts it into the sea. A large pyre is built. Patroclus' body is placed on it, along with fat, honey, oil, four horses, two dogs, and twelve Trojan captives sacrificed by Achilles. The pyre does not burn. Achilles prays to the Winds (Zephyr and Boreas). Iris, sent by Achilles, goes to the Winds, who then rush forth and ignite the pyre. All night the pyre burns, and Achilles mourns. At dawn, the flames subside. Achilles gathers Patroclus' bones, places them in a golden urn, and builds a tomb. Achilles then announces funeral games.
*   **Chariot Race:** Diomed wins 1st prize (a woman and a tripod-vase). Antilochus, by cunning, takes 2nd (a mare) from Menelaus.

**The Redemption of the Body of Hector (Book XXIV)**
Achilles, consumed by grief, cannot sleep. Each dawn, he drags Hector's body thrice around Patroclus' tomb. Apollo protects Hector's body from decay. The gods are moved by Hector's fate. Apollo complains about Achilles' cruelty. Juno defends Achilles. Jupiter commands Thetis to tell Achilles to return Hector's body for ransom, and Iris to tell Priam to go alone with gifts to Achilles, promising divine protection. Thetis delivers Jove's message to Achilles, who agrees. Iris delivers Jove's message to Priam. Hecuba pleads with Priam not to go, fearing Achilles. Priam prays to Jove, who sends an eagle as a favorable omen. Priam prepares rich gifts. He angrily drives away his remaining sons, lamenting their inferiority to Hector. Priam and his herald Idæus set off. Jove sends Hermes, disguised as a young Myrmidon, to guide and protect Priam. Hermes reassures Priam, reveals Hector's body is preserved, and guides them safely past the Greek guards to Achilles' tent. Hermes reveals his identity and departs. Priam enters Achilles' tent, embraces his knees, and kisses his hands, pleading for Hector's body by reminding Achilles of his own aged father, Peleus. Achilles is moved to tears, remembering his father and Patroclus. Both men weep. Achilles raises Priam, comforts him, and tells him to cease mourning, recounting the tale of Niobe. Achilles agrees to return Hector's body by Jove's command. He orders the handmaids to wash and anoint Hector's body away from Priam's sight. Achilles himself lifts Hector's body onto the funeral bed on the car, lamenting to Patroclus' shade. Achilles invites Priam to eat and rest. Priam requests twelve days for Hector's funeral rites. Achilles grants the truce. Priam and Idæus sleep in the porch. Hermes wakes Priam and Idæus, urging them to leave before the Greeks discover them. Hermes guides them safely out of the Greek camp. Aurora rises. Cassandra sees Priam's chariot with Hector's body and raises the alarm in Troy. The Trojans rush out, lamenting Hector. Priam orders them to take Hector to the palace. Hector's body is placed on a bed of state. Andromache, Hecuba, and Helen lead the lamentations, mourning Hector's death, the future of Astyanax, and the fall of Troy. Priam orders the Trojans to gather wood for the pyre. For nine days, they gather wood. On the tenth day, Hector's body is burned. At dawn, they quench the fire, collect his bones in a golden urn, and build a tomb. Guards watch during the rites. The Trojans return to Priam's court for a funeral feast. The mighty Hector's shade rests in peace."
The Scarlet Letter-Nathaniel Hawthorne,"The narrative begins with a detailed description of the dilapidated Custom-House in Salem, Massachusetts, as observed by the narrator, who holds the position of Surveyor. He describes the building, its flag, and the general lack of commercial activity, contrasting it with its past bustling days. He then introduces his elderly colleagues, mostly aged sea-captains and Custom-House officers, who are largely inactive and prone to sleeping, but who are allowed to remain due to the Collector's (General Miller's) conservative nature. The narrator, a faithful Democrat, acknowledges his role in abbreviating the official breath of some of these venerable servants by representing them as needing rest, after which they soon died. He also describes a particularly robust and simple-minded Inspector, a ""patriarch"" of the Custom-House, who, despite his age, possessed immense physical vitality and a singular focus on the pleasures of eating, seemingly devoid of deeper intellect or moral sensibility. The narrator finds this Inspector to be the most fitting Custom-House officer he has known. He also sketches the Collector, General Miller, a former military hero now burdened by infirmities, whose mind, though dimmed, retains its strength and integrity. The narrator reflects on his own intellectual stagnation and loss of literary inspiration during his time in public office, feeling that his imaginative faculties have become ""pointless and inefficacious.""

One idle, rainy day, while sifting through old documents in an unfinished room of the Custom-House, the narrator discovers a small package wrapped in ancient yellow parchment. Inside, he finds a commission for one Jonathan Pue, a former Surveyor of his Majesty's Customs, and a piece of fine red cloth. This cloth, much worn and faded, is skillfully embroidered with gold thread and takes the shape of the capital letter ""A."" The narrator is strangely interested in it, and upon placing it on his breast, experiences a sensation of ""burning heat,"" as if it were red-hot iron, causing him to shudder and drop it.

He then examines a small roll of dingy paper twisted around the letter. This manuscript, written by Surveyor Pue, provides a ""reasonably complete explanation of the whole affair,"" detailing the life and experiences of a noteworthy personage named Hester Prynne, who lived between the early days of Massachusetts and the late seventeenth century. The narrator states that the main facts of the story he is about to tell are authenticated by this document, which, along with the scarlet letter itself, remains in his possession. He imagines the ghost of Surveyor Pue appearing to him, exhorting him to bring these ""mouldy and moth-eaten lucubrations before the public"" for profit, as the narrator's own office tenure is precarious.

Indeed, the narrator's reflections on the detrimental effect of public office on one's character prove prophetic. A ""remarkable event of the third year of my Surveyorship"" is the election of General Taylor to the Presidency, bringing in a hostile administration. The narrator, a Democrat, is summarily dismissed from his post, feeling like a ""decapitated Surveyor."" This involuntary withdrawal, however, frees his mind from its ""wretched numbness"" and allows him to return to his literary pursuits, using Surveyor Pue's manuscript as the foundation for his tale. He reflects that the Custom-House experience, though stifling, ultimately led him back to his true calling. He concludes the introduction by stating that his colleagues are now mere shadows, and he has disconnected from his old town, which will soon become a hazy memory.

The actual story, ""THE SCARLET LETTER,"" begins with a throng of grim-faced Puritan men and women gathered before a weather-stained wooden prison in Boston. The prison, built early in the colony's history, appears old and forbidding. A wild rose-bush, growing by the prison door, is noted as a symbol of nature's pity.

On a summer morning, the crowd, particularly the women, eagerly awaits a penal infliction. They discuss the severity of the punishment for Hester Prynne, with some suggesting a brand of hot iron or even death. The town-beadle opens the prison door, leading forth Hester Prynne, a tall, elegant, and beautiful young woman, carrying a three-month-old infant. On her breast, Hester wears an elaborately embroidered scarlet letter ""A"" of fine red cloth with gold thread, a defiant display of her needlework. The beadle announces her sentence: to stand for three hours on the pillory platform in the market-place, and then to wear the scarlet letter for the remainder of her life. Hester endures the public gaze, her mind recalling memories of her past in Old England, including her parents and a pale, deformed scholar-like man (her husband). She clutches her child and touches the letter, confirming the painful reality of her shame.

Among the crowd, Hester spots a white man with an Indian companion. She recognizes the man, who is small, furrowed-faced, and slightly deformed, with one shoulder higher than the other. His face shows a fleeting expression of horror before he calms himself and gestures for Hester to remain silent. This man, Roger Chillingworth, asks a townsman about Hester's identity and crime. The townsman explains Hester is the wife of a learned English man who sent her to Boston two years prior, but has not been heard from since. Chillingworth reveals he is a wanderer, recently freed from Indian captivity, and asks about the baby's father. The townsman states Hester refuses to name him. Chillingworth, with a bitter smile, remarks that the father ""will be known!""

Reverend John Wilson, an elder clergyman, urges Hester to confess the father's name from the balcony above the scaffold. Governor Bellingham supports this, placing the responsibility on the young Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale, Hester's pastor. Dimmesdale, pale and tremulous, implores Hester to reveal the name for her soul's peace, but she steadfastly refuses, stating the letter is ""too deeply branded"" and that her child must seek a heavenly father. A voice from the crowd, which Hester recognizes, also demands she speak. Dimmesdale, with a long respiration, murmurs, ""She will not speak!"" Mr. Wilson then delivers a long sermon on sin. Hester, in a state of insensibility, is led back to prison.

In prison, Hester is in a state of nervous excitement. Master Brackett, the jailer, brings in Roger Chillingworth, who introduces himself as a physician. Chillingworth, who had been held for ransom by Indians, first calms Hester's convulsing infant with an herbal draught. He then offers Hester a similar draught to calm her, assuring her it is not poison. Hester drinks it. Chillingworth reveals he is her husband, acknowledging his own ""folly"" in marrying her, an old, deformed scholar, to her youth and beauty. He declares he seeks no vengeance against Hester, but vows to find the man who wronged them both. He promises not to expose the father to public law or harm his life or fame, but to read the ""letter on his heart"" and make him ""mine!"" Hester is terrified by his words. Chillingworth then extracts a solemn oath from Hester that she will never reveal his identity as her husband. He leaves, smiling ominously, and Hester wonders if he is the ""Black Man"" who haunts the forest.

Upon her release from prison, Hester chooses to remain in Boston, settling in an isolated cottage on the peninsula. She supports herself and Pearl through her exquisite needlework, which is highly sought after for official garments and funerals, but never for a bride's veil. Her own dress is coarse and somber, adorned only by the scarlet letter, but Pearl is dressed in rich, fanciful garments, often crimson and gold, which seem to embody the scarlet letter itself. Hester gives her surplus earnings to charity, often receiving insults. She feels isolated and constantly tormented by the public gaze and the mockery of children. She develops a ""new sense"" from the scarlet letter, a sympathetic knowledge of hidden sin in others, which reveals hypocrisy in seemingly pious figures. Pearl, named as Hester's ""treasure,"" is a wild, defiant, and uncontrollable child, reflecting her mother's impassioned state. Pearl's first conscious awareness was the scarlet letter, and she frequently fixes her gaze on it with a peculiar smile, causing Hester immense pain. Pearl often throws flowers at the letter on Hester's breast. When Hester asks Pearl who made her, Pearl replies she was ""plucked by her mother off the bush of wild roses that grew by the prison-door,"" and later, touching the scarlet letter, declares she has no Heavenly Father. Hester is tormented by the townspeople's rumors that Pearl is a ""demon offspring.""

Hester visits Governor Bellingham's mansion to deliver embroidered gloves and, more importantly, to prevent the magistrates from taking Pearl away, as they believe Hester is an unfit mother. Pearl, dressed in crimson and gold, resembles the scarlet letter. Puritan children mock them, but Pearl fiercely chases them away. Inside the mansion, Pearl sees her reflection in a suit of armor, where the scarlet letter on Hester's breast appears exaggerated. Governor Bellingham and Mr. Wilson question Pearl's Christian upbringing. Pearl perversely states she was plucked from a rose bush. Hester fiercely defends her right to keep Pearl, appealing to Mr. Dimmesdale. Dimmesdale, pale and clutching his heart, argues that God gave Pearl to Hester as a blessing and a retribution, to keep her mother's soul alive. The Governor agrees to let Hester keep Pearl, provided she is catechized. Pearl, in a rare moment of tenderness, takes Dimmesdale's hand and allows him to kiss her brow, then laughs and capers away. Chillingworth remarks on Pearl's nature and asks if the father could be guessed. As Hester and Pearl leave, Mistress Hibbins, the Governor's sister and a reputed witch, invites Hester to a meeting with the ""Black Man"" in the forest. Hester refuses, but states that if Pearl had been taken, she would have gone and signed her name in the Black Man's book with her own blood.

Chillingworth, now living with Dimmesdale as his physician, is consumed by revenge. He relentlessly probes Dimmesdale's inner life, seeking his secret. Dimmesdale, though vaguely sensing an inimical presence, cannot identify his enemy and continues their familiar intercourse. Chillingworth gathers herbs from the graveyard, suggesting they grow from buried secrets. Dimmesdale, afflicted by his secret guilt, argues that only Divine mercy can reveal such secrets. Dimmesdale's health continues to decline, marked by paleness and a hand pressed to his heart, yet his powerful sermons earn him immense public reverence, which tortures him as he feels himself a ""pollution and a lie."" He practices self-scourging, fasting, and vigils, seeing visions of devils, angels, and his parents, and Hester and Pearl pointing at his breast. One night, Dimmesdale, in a somnambulistic state, goes to the scaffold where Hester stood. He shrieks aloud, but no one hears him as he intended. He sees Governor Bellingham and Mistress Hibbins, and then Mr. Wilson, passing by. He imagines the town finding him there. Pearl and Hester appear. Dimmesdale invites them onto the scaffold, and they form an ""electric chain."" Pearl asks if he will stand with them at ""to-morrow noontide,"" but he refuses, promising to stand with them ""At the great judgment day."" A meteor flashes across the sky, which Dimmesdale, in his disordered state, interprets as a red ""A."" Pearl points to Chillingworth, who is watching them. Dimmesdale, terrified, asks Hester who the man is, expressing hatred. Hester remains silent due to her oath. Chillingworth approaches, feigning concern, and leads Dimmesdale home. The next day, Dimmesdale preaches a powerful sermon, but the sexton finds his glove on the scaffold, and the meteor is interpreted as an ""A"" for ""Angel.""

Hester, realizing the depth of Dimmesdale's suffering and Chillingworth's malevolent influence, feels a responsibility to act. Seven years have passed, and her public image has softened; the scarlet letter is now interpreted by many as ""Able,"" recognizing her strength and helpfulness. She resolves to reveal Chillingworth's true identity to Dimmesdale. She finds Chillingworth gathering herbs by the sea. Hester sends Pearl to play, and Pearl, after playing with her reflection and making a ""mermaid's garb"" with a green ""A"" on her own breast, asks Hester what her scarlet letter means and why the minister keeps his hand over his heart. Hester, for the first time, lies, saying she wears it for the gold thread.

Hester confronts Chillingworth, observing his transformation into a fiend driven by revenge. He boasts of his torment of Dimmesdale, saying he has kept him alive to prolong his suffering. Chillingworth acknowledges that Hester herself is partly responsible for his transformation, and Hester, in turn, admits her hatred for him, recognizing her own wrong in marrying him. She declares her intention to reveal his secret to Dimmesdale. Chillingworth, in a moment of self-awareness, sees himself as a fiend and expresses pity for Hester, but maintains that their fate is sealed by a ""dark necessity."" He tells her to do as she will with Dimmesdale.

Hester meets Dimmesdale in the forest. They speak of their shared misery and his lack of peace. Dimmesdale confesses his agony and hypocrisy, longing for someone to know his true sinful nature. Hester reveals Chillingworth is her husband. Dimmesdale is horrified and initially blames Hester, but then forgives her, saying Chillingworth's revenge is ""blacker than my sin."" They sit together, finding solace in their shared secret. Hester urges Dimmesdale to escape with her and Pearl to the Old World, to begin a new life free from Chillingworth's torment and public shame. Dimmesdale, initially despairing, is invigorated by her plan and agrees, declaring, ""Thou shalt not go alone!""

Hester, in a moment of joy and liberation, unclasps the scarlet letter and throws it away. Her beauty, youth, and warmth return, and the forest is flooded with sunshine. She calls Pearl to meet her father. Pearl, who has been playing with forest animals, approaches slowly. She sees her mother without the letter and refuses to cross the brook. Pearl points at Hester's breast, indicating the missing letter. Hester, saddened, retrieves the scarlet letter and fastens it back on. Her beauty and warmth vanish, and a gray shadow falls over her. Pearl then crosses the brook, embraces her mother, and kisses the scarlet letter. Pearl asks if Dimmesdale will walk hand-in-hand with them into town, and if he will always keep his hand over his heart. Hester tries to bring Pearl to Dimmesdale, but Pearl, influenced by her capricious nature, washes off Dimmesdale's kiss at the brook.

Dimmesdale, returning to town, feels an unaccustomed energy but also experiences strange, wicked impulses, barely restraining himself from blasphemous words or actions towards various townspeople. Mistress Hibbins encounters him, implying knowledge of his forest meeting with the ""Black Man."" Dimmesdale realizes his yielding to sin has unleashed a ""brotherhood of bad ones"" within him. He throws his unfinished Election Sermon into the fire and writes a new one with inspired fervor.

On Election Day, Hester and Pearl are in the market-place. Hester's face is calm, but Pearl is restless. The shipmaster, with whom Hester has arranged passage to Bristol for herself, Pearl, and Dimmesdale, informs Hester that Chillingworth has also booked passage on the same ship, intending to accompany ""his friend, the gentleman you spoke of."" Hester is horrified, realizing Chillingworth's relentless pursuit.

The procession begins, with military escort, magistrates, and then Dimmesdale, who walks with unaccustomed energy, delivering his powerful Election Sermon. Hester, watching him, feels his remoteness and doubts their shared future. Mistress Hibbins again speaks to Hester, hinting at Dimmesdale's secret connection to the ""Black Man"" and predicting his mark will be revealed. Pearl, playing in the market-place, receives a gold chain from the shipmaster, who also relays Chillingworth's message about their shared passage.

After the sermon, Dimmesdale, looking feeble and pale, totters towards the scaffold where Hester and Pearl stand. Governor Bellingham attempts to assist him, but Dimmesdale repels him. Dimmesdale calls Hester and Pearl to him. Chillingworth rushes forward, trying to stop him, whispering, ""Madman, hold! what is your purpose?"" Dimmesdale, asserting God's help, declares Chillingworth's power is broken. He calls Hester to support him onto the scaffold, Pearl holding his hand. Chillingworth follows, stating Dimmesdale could not have escaped him anywhere ""save on this very scaffold!"" Dimmesdale thanks God. He asks Hester if this public revelation is better than their forest dream, to which she replies she doesn't know, but that they may all die together. Dimmesdale, a dying man, addresses the multitude, confessing he is ""the one sinner of the world!"" He reveals that the scarlet letter on Hester's breast is but a shadow of what he bears on his own. With a convulsive motion, he tears open his ministerial band, revealing a mark on his breast (the text refrains from describing it). The crowd is horrified. Dimmesdale sinks down. Chillingworth kneels beside him, repeating, ""Thou hast escaped me!"" Dimmesdale tells Chillingworth, ""May God forgive thee! Thou, too, hast deeply sinned!"" He turns to Pearl, who kisses his lips, breaking a ""spell,"" and developing her sympathies. Dimmesdale bids Hester farewell, expressing doubt about their reunion in an ""everlasting and pure"" state, but praising God's mercy in his afflictions, which included the burning torture on his breast, Chillingworth's torment, and his public death. He dies with the word ""Farewell!""

After Dimmesdale's death, various accounts circulate about the mark on his breast. Most witnesses claim to have seen a scarlet letter ""A"" imprinted in his flesh, with theories ranging from self-infliction to Chillingworth's magic, or the gnawing of remorse. However, some deny any mark, believing Dimmesdale's death was a parable about human righteousness. The narrator, relying on Surveyor Pue's manuscript, confirms the former view and offers the moral: ""Be true! Be true! Be true! Show freely to the world, if not your worst, yet some trait whereby the worst may be inferred!""

Roger Chillingworth, deprived of his object of revenge, rapidly withers away and dies within a year, having no further purpose in life. By his will, he bequeaths a considerable amount of property to little Pearl, making her a rich heiress. Not long after Chillingworth's death, Hester Prynne and Pearl disappear from Boston. Years later, Hester Prynne, still wearing the scarlet letter, returns to her old cottage. Pearl's fate is not explicitly stated, but indications (letters, luxuries in the cottage, a baby-garment Hester embroiders) suggest she is alive, married, happy, and mindful of her mother, living in another land. Hester chooses to resume her life in New England, of her own free will, and the scarlet letter, through her self-devoted years, ceases to be a stigma and becomes a symbol of awe and reverence. Women, burdened by their own sorrows, seek Hester's counsel. Hester comforts them and expresses her belief in a future ""new truth"" that will establish a surer relation between man and woman, though she no longer believes she is the destined prophetess. Many years later, Hester dies and is buried in the old burial-ground, near Dimmesdale's grave, but with a space between them. Their shared tombstone bears an engraved escutcheon with the motto: ""ON A FIELD, SABLE, THE LETTER A, GULES."""
Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea-Jules Verne,"The year 1866 was marked by a mysterious, enormous, spindle-shaped, and occasionally phosphorescent object sighted by numerous vessels across the globe. This object, far larger and more rapid than any known whale, caused significant agitation among maritime populations and governments. Incidents included the steamer *Governor Higginson* encountering it off Australia, mistaking it for a sandbank until it ejected water columns, and the *Columbus* observing its surprising velocity in the Pacific. Later, the *Helvetia* and *Shannon* simultaneously sighted it in the Atlantic, estimating its length at over 350 feet. Further reports, including a collision involving the *Etna*, fueled public concern.

Initially, the phenomenon was debated as either a colossal sea monster or a submarine vessel. Professor Pierre Aronnax, an Assistant Professor in the Museum of Natural History in Paris, returned from a scientific expedition to Nebraska and found himself deeply involved in the mystery. After dismissing theories of floating islands or wrecks due to the object's speed, he published an article in the *New York Herald* proposing the existence of a gigantic, electric narwhal, capable of piercing ship hulls with its immense tusk, a theory supported by the damage to the *Scotia*.

The United States government, spurred by public demand, organized an expedition to hunt this ""monster."" The fast frigate *Abraham Lincoln*, commanded by Captain Farragut, was commissioned. After two months without a sighting, a report from a steamer in the North Pacific reignited the search. Professor Aronnax received an invitation from the Secretary of Marine, J.B. Hobson, to join the expedition, representing France. Despite his weariness, Aronnax accepted, seeing it as his true calling. His devoted Flemish servant, Conseil, agreed to accompany him without question. They boarded the *Abraham Lincoln* in New York, which departed to public cheers.

Captain Farragut was resolute in his belief in the monster and his determination to destroy it, a conviction shared by his officers. A reward of two thousand dollars was offered for the first sighting. On board was Ned Land, a Canadian harpooner of exceptional skill, who, ironically, did not believe in the unicorn. Aronnax attempted to convince Ned with scientific arguments about the immense pressure at ocean depths and the strength required for such a creature, suggesting it must be ""made of sheet iron.""

The voyage was long and largely uneventful, though Ned Land demonstrated his harpooning prowess by catching two whales during a brief stop. The *Abraham Lincoln* rounded Cape Horn and entered the Pacific. After three months of fruitless searching, during which the crew's enthusiasm waned, Captain Farragut promised to abandon the hunt in three days if the monster did not appear. On the night of November 5, just as the deadline neared, Ned Land sighted an intense, inexplicable electric light on the starboard side.

The object, identified by Aronnax as electrical, moved with astonishing speed, encircling the frigate with luminous rings before rushing towards it and disappearing. It reappeared, emitting loud sounds. The next morning, November 6, after a thick fog cleared, Ned Land sighted the creature again, a long blackish body, 250 feet in length, ejecting steam and water. The *Abraham Lincoln* pursued it at full speed, but the creature easily matched and exceeded the frigate's pace, toying with it. Captain Farragut ordered the forecastle gun to fire, and a shot hit the animal but glanced off its rounded surface. As night fell, the electric light reappeared. Captain Farragut decided to approach stealthily and harpoon it while it seemed motionless. Ned Land took his position. He threw his harpoon, striking a hard body. The light vanished, and two enormous waterspouts broke over the frigate, followed by a fearful shock that threw Aronnax into the sea.

Aronnax, a strong swimmer, surfaced and was rescued by Conseil, who had followed him into the water. Conseil reported that the frigate's screw and rudder were broken. Ned Land then appeared, having found footing on the ""gigantic narwhal"" itself. He revealed that his harpoon had been blunted because the creature was ""made of sheet iron."" Aronnax realized the ""monster"" was a human-built submarine. The submarine began to move, and the three men clung to its exterior. After a night of uncertainty, during which Aronnax heard vague sounds from within, the submarine began to sink. A panel opened, a man appeared briefly, and then eight masked men emerged, forcibly pulling Aronnax, Ned, and Conseil into the formidable machine.

They were confined in a dark cabin, which was then illuminated by intense electric light. Two men entered, one of whom was the commander, a tall, calm, and intelligent individual. Aronnax, Ned, and Conseil attempted to communicate in French, English, German, and Latin, but the commander showed no sign of understanding. The men then left. A steward, who appeared to be mute or deaf, brought them strange, marine-based food and water. Aronnax noticed the letter ""N"" and the motto ""MOBILIS IN MOBILI"" engraved on the dinnerware, deducing ""N"" was the commander's initial. They ate, and Aronnax's companions fell asleep.

Aronnax awoke to heavy air, realizing the submarine needed to surface for air renewal. He felt the boat roll and then a current of fresh, saline air. Ned and Conseil awoke, and Aronnax explained the boat's ventilation. Ned became impatient when food was delayed. When the steward finally appeared, Ned Land attacked him, but was stopped by the commander, who spoke in perfect French.

The commander, Captain Nemo, revealed he understood all their languages but had chosen to observe them first. He identified them and explained that they had ""troubled his existence"" by pursuing him. He stated he was ""not what you call a civilised man,"" having broken all ties with humanity and living outside its laws. He offered them hospitality on board the *Nautilus* (the name of his submarine), but under the condition that they would never leave and would submit to confinement if certain events required it. Ned Land refused to give his word of honor, but Aronnax accepted, realizing they had no choice. Captain Nemo then revealed his vast knowledge of the sea and promised Aronnax a journey of wonders. He showed Aronnax the *Nautilus*'s elegant dining-room, its twelve-thousand-volume library (where he smoked cigars made of seaweed), and a magnificent museum of marine treasures and art, all collected by himself.

Captain Nemo then explained the *Nautilus*'s advanced technology. It was an elongated, cigar-shaped cylinder, 232 feet long, made of two strong steel hulls. It was powered entirely by electricity, generated from sodium extracted from seawater. Electricity provided light, heat, motion (a speed of 50 miles per hour), and even air renewal through powerful pumps. He explained how the *Nautilus* submerged by filling reservoirs with water and rose by emptying them, and how inclined planes and a rudder allowed horizontal and vertical movement. A glazed pilot's cage with thick lenses and a powerful electric reflector allowed navigation in the deep. Captain Nemo confessed the *Scotia* incident was accidental, but the *Abraham Lincoln* attack was self-defense. He revealed he had secretly built the *Nautilus* on a desert island using parts from various countries, then destroyed all traces. He was immensely rich, using his wealth for purposes he hinted were related to ""suffering beings and oppressed races.""

The *Nautilus* then began its journey across the Pacific, following the Kuro-Scivo current. Aronnax, Ned, and Conseil were amazed when the saloon panels opened, revealing the brilliantly lit submarine world outside, teeming with diverse fish. The journey continued, with Captain Nemo often absent. They passed the Sandwich Islands and Marquesas. One day, at a depth of 1,000 yards, they encountered the wreck of ""The Florida, Sunderland,"" a grim sight with five corpses, including a woman and infant, still on its deck.

They sailed near the Pomotou Islands, where Aronnax studied coral formations. Captain Nemo, when asked about new continents, stated, ""The earth does not want new continents, but new men."" They then reached Vanikoro, the site of La Perouse's lost expedition. Captain Nemo, possessing a tin-plate box containing La Perouse's annotated instructions, revealed the true fate of the explorer's crew, who perished in a smaller boat after their ships wrecked. He expressed a desire for a ""coral tomb"" for himself and his comrades, ""forgotten by all else, but not by us.""

The *Nautilus* entered the Torres Strait, a dangerous passage. On January 4, 1863, it ran aground near Gilboa Island. Captain Nemo calmly assured them the full moon's tide would free them. To Ned Land's delight, Captain Nemo granted them permission to go ashore. For two days, they explored the island, collecting coconuts, bread-fruit, cabbage-palms, beans, and yams. Ned Land successfully hunted wood-pigeons, a hog, and kangaroos, while Conseil found a ""drunk"" bird of paradise. On the second evening, as Ned suggested they might never return to the *Nautilus*, stones were thrown at them by natives.

About a hundred Papuan savages appeared. Aronnax, Ned, and Conseil quickly returned to the *Nautilus*. Captain Nemo, absorbed in playing his organ, was unfazed by the news, stating the *Nautilus* had nothing to fear. The next morning, hundreds of natives surrounded the vessel. Aronnax found a rare ""left shell,"" which was then broken by a native's stone. Conseil, in retaliation, shot the native's arm. Canoes surrounded the *Nautilus*, firing arrows. Aronnax informed Captain Nemo, who calmly ordered the hatches closed. When Aronnax expressed concern about renewing air the next day, Captain Nemo revealed the platform's metallic rail was charged with electricity. When the tide rose, the *Nautilus* freed itself. As the Papuans attempted to board, they were repelled by electric shocks from the rail, including Ned Land, who was ""struck by a thunderbolt."" The *Nautilus* then sailed safely out of the strait.

The *Nautilus* sped west, then south-west, through the Indian Ocean. Captain Nemo conducted experiments on deep-sea temperatures. They passed through a dazzling phosphorescent ""milk sea"" caused by luminous infusoria. They encountered dangerous sharks, which Ned Land longed to harpoon, but Captain Nemo refused to allow ""killing for killing's sake."" Near Ceylon, Captain Nemo invited them to a pearl fishery. Underwater, they observed the oyster banks and a gigantic tridacne oyster containing a pearl the size of a coconut, which Captain Nemo left to grow. They witnessed an Indian pearl diver attacked by a gigantic shark. Captain Nemo, with admirable courage, fought the shark with his dagger, and Ned Land delivered the killing blow with his harpoon. Captain Nemo saved the Indian and gave him a bag of pearls, revealing his compassion for ""an inhabitant of an oppressed country.""

The *Nautilus* entered the Red Sea, passing Djeddah and Aden. Captain Nemo revealed his secret ""Arabian Tunnel,"" a natural subterranean passage beneath the Isthmus of Suez, which he had discovered and used to connect the Red Sea and Mediterranean. The *Nautilus* traversed this tunnel at high speed. In the Mediterranean, Ned Land grew increasingly desperate to escape. Aronnax, though intrigued by the voyage, also felt homesick. Captain Nemo became more withdrawn. He showed Aronnax a manuscript of his life story and studies, intended to be cast into the sea in a floating case. Aronnax offered to keep it if they were freed, but Captain Nemo firmly refused, reiterating that whoever entered the *Nautilus* must never leave.

The *Nautilus* then braved a violent hurricane off Long Island, near New York, with Captain Nemo defiantly on the platform. Aronnax witnessed the immense power of the storm and the *Nautilus*'s invulnerability. Later, in the Atlantic, they passed over the transatlantic cable. On June 1, the *Nautilus* searched a specific spot. Captain Nemo, looking gloomier than ever, declared, ""It is here."" He then identified a sunken French warship, the *Avenger*, which had chosen to sink with its crew rather than surrender 74 years prior, on that very spot. Aronnax realized Captain Nemo's immense wealth came from salvaging such wrecks. Captain Nemo then revealed his motivation: his hatred for an ""accursed nation"" that had caused him to lose ""country, wife, children, father, and mother.""

A large, armored warship approached, firing upon the *Nautilus*. Captain Nemo, transfigured by rage, unfurled a black flag with a gold ""N"" and ordered Aronnax and his companions below, declaring he would sink the vessel. Aronnax, Ned, and Conseil were trapped in the saloon as the *Nautilus* submerged. It accelerated, then struck the warship below the waterline, passing through it ""like a needle through sailcloth."" Aronnax rushed to the panel, witnessing the vessel's agonizing descent, its decks blowing up, and its crew drowning. Captain Nemo, a ""terrible avenger,"" watched impassively. After the destruction, he retreated to his room, where Aronnax saw him kneel before a portrait of a woman and two children, bursting into deep sobs.

The *Nautilus* then sped northward at a frightful pace, constantly submerged, its clocks stopped. Aronnax lost all sense of time. Captain Nemo and his crew were rarely seen, appearing ""stupefied."" Ned Land's patience was exhausted. One morning, Ned woke Aronnax, announcing they would escape that night, as land was sighted 20 miles east. Aronnax agreed, preparing for the desperate flight. At 9:30 PM, Aronnax heard Captain Nemo playing his organ in the saloon, murmuring, ""Almighty God! enough! enough!"" as if in remorse. Aronnax crept through the saloon to join Ned and Conseil in the boat. Ned fastened the *Nautilus*'s opening with a false key and began to loosen the bolts holding their boat. Suddenly, loud voices cried, ""The maelstrom! the maelstrom!"" They realized they were on the dangerous coast of Norway, being drawn into the irresistible whirlpool. The *Nautilus* spiraled with dizzying speed. A crashing noise was heard, the bolts gave way, and their boat was hurled into the Maelstrom. Aronnax hit his head and lost consciousness.

Aronnax later awoke in a fisherman's hut on the Loffoden Isles, with Ned Land and Conseil safe. He could not recall how they escaped the Maelstrom. He revised his journal, affirming the truth of his incredible ten-month, 20,000-league voyage. He wondered about the fate of the *Nautilus* and Captain Nemo, hoping the vessel survived and that Captain Nemo's hatred had been appeased, allowing the ""philosopher"" to continue his peaceful exploration. Aronnax concluded that only Captain Nemo and himself had the right to answer the question of what lies in the ""far off and exceeding deep."""
Ulysses-James Joyce,"The novel opens on June 16, 1904, with Stephen Dedalus at the Martello tower near Dublin. His acquaintance, Buck Mulligan, mocks him about his deceased mother and his refusal to pray at her deathbed. Stephen, feeling pain and resentment, remembers his mother's suffering. Mulligan, who shares the tower with an Englishman named Haines, asks Stephen for money, as Stephen is due to be paid from his teaching job.

Haines discusses Irish art and Shakespeare's Hamlet with Stephen. Mulligan continues his taunts, singing a blasphemous song about Jesus. Stephen, feeling alienated, gives Mulligan the key to the tower and some money. He then leaves the tower, choosing not to join Mulligan and Haines for a swim, reflecting on his mother's death and Mulligan's perceived betrayal.

Stephen teaches a history lesson, discussing Pyrrhus, and later poses a riddle to his students. After class, he helps a boy named Sargent with a math problem, which leads him to reflect on his mother's unconditional love. He then goes to the school's headmaster, Mr. Deasy, to collect his wages.

Mr. Deasy pays Stephen three pounds twelve shillings and gives him a letter about foot-and-mouth disease to submit to the press. Deasy expresses strong anti-Semitic views, claiming Jews are undermining England. Stephen challenges his perspective, and Deasy later calls him back to assert that Ireland has never persecuted Jews because it never allowed them entry. Stephen leaves, contemplating the day's events and the name ""bullockbefriending bard"" given to him.

Stephen walks alone on Sandymount strand, lost in philosophical thoughts about perception and memory. He observes two women, one with a midwife's bag, and reflects on birth and his own origins. He recalls his family and his time in Paris. He uses a rock to write down Mr. Deasy's letter. He then watches a dog and a couple picking cockles, and his thoughts turn to his mother's death and his inability to save her from drowning. He finds his handkerchief, used by Mulligan, and discards it, before seeing a ship sail silently.

Leopold Bloom begins his day by preparing breakfast for his wife, Molly, including a grilled mutton kidney. He feeds their cat and then leaves the house to buy a fresh pork kidney. As he walks through Dublin, he observes the city and its inhabitants, his thoughts drifting to his daughter Milly, his deceased father, and his work in advertising. He reads a prospectus for a company planting trees in Palestine.

Returning home, Bloom finds letters, one of which is for Molly from Blazes Boylan, confirming a visit later that day. Molly asks Bloom to explain ""metempsychosis,"" which he defines as the transmigration of souls. He realizes he has burnt the kidney while reading Milly's letter, which mentions a young student singing Boylan's song. Bloom feels a pang of unease regarding Molly and Boylan. He then goes to the outhouse to read a story from ""Titbits"" and relieve himself.

Bloom walks along Sir John Rogerson's Quay, thinking about the day's funeral. He retrieves a letter from Martha Clifford, his secret correspondent, from his hatband. He meets C.P. M'Coy, who asks him to sign his name in the funeral book if he cannot attend. Bloom reads Martha's flirtatious letter, which asks about his wife's perfume, then tears up the envelope.

He enters All Hallows church, observing a communion service and reflecting on Catholic rituals. Leaving the church, he considers buying a skin lotion for Molly and remembers his forgotten latchkey. At Sweny's chemist, he tries to order the lotion but lacks the recipe. He encounters Bantam Lyons, who asks to see his newspaper for horse racing tips. Bloom, intending to discard the paper, tells Lyons he can keep it, which Lyons misinterprets as a tip for a horse named ""Throwaway."" Bloom then walks towards the public baths, anticipating a relaxing soak.

Bloom rides in a funeral carriage with Martin Cunningham, Mr. Power, and Simon Dedalus to Paddy Dignam's burial. He reflects on death, the loss of his infant son Rudy, and his wife Molly. They pass Stephen, walking alone, prompting Simon Dedalus to express disdain for Stephen's association with Mulligan. The conversation turns to the story of Reuben J. Dodd's son, who attempted suicide by drowning.

The sight of a child's coffin reminds Bloom of Rudy. They discuss suicide, and Bloom recalls his own father's death by poison. As they pass the cattle market, Bloom suggests the idea of municipal funeral trams. Upon arrival at Glasnevin cemetery, the coffin is carried into the chapel. Bloom kneels on his newspaper during the service.

After the service, as the coffin is buried, Simon Dedalus weeps at his wife's grave. John Henry Menton, a solicitor, makes a disparaging comment about Molly, prompting Bloom to point out a dent in Menton's hat, which Menton dismisses.

At the _Freeman's Journal_ office, Bloom attempts to place an advertisement for Alexander Keyes, who wants a design featuring two crossed keys. Editor Myles Crawford, Professor MacHugh, and J.J. O'Molloy discuss Irish literature and politics. Crawford, in a drunken state, recounts Ignatius Gallaher's journalistic coup during the Phoenix Park murders.

Bloom tries to use the telephone and collides with Lenehan. Stephen arrives to submit Mr. Deasy's letter, which Crawford dismisses as ""all balls"" but promises to print. Stephen then tells a story about two old women climbing Nelson's Pillar, which he calls ""A Pisgah Sight of Palestine or The Parable of The Plums."" Crawford, in a fit of rage, tells Bloom to tell Keyes he can ""kiss my royal Irish arse"" regarding the ad. Bloom leaves, followed by newsboys.

Bloom walks through Dublin, feeling hungry and receiving a religious pamphlet. He sees Dilly Dedalus, looking underfed, outside an auction house. He throws bread crumbs to gulls on O'Connell Bridge, reflecting on poets and the sea. He enters Davy Byrne's pub, ordering a gorgonzola sandwich and burgundy. Nosey Flynn informs him that Blazes Boylan is organizing Molly's concert tour, causing Bloom a ""warm shock.""

Bantam Lyons enters, revealing Bloom's earlier ""tip"" for ""Throwaway"" (the horse that won the Gold Cup), which Bloom had intended to discard. Bloom leaves, helping a blind stripling cross the street, and heads to the National Library, but ducks into the museum when he sees a man he suspects is Boylan.

In the National Library, Stephen Dedalus debates Shakespeare's Hamlet with John Eglinton, A.E. (Russell), and Mr. Best. Stephen presents his theory that Shakespeare, as the ghost of Hamlet's father, is reflecting his own personal life, particularly his wife Ann Hathaway's alleged infidelity and the ""secondbest bed"" left to her in his will. The discussion touches on Irish art and the father-son relationship.

Buck Mulligan enters, mocking Stephen's theory and reading aloud a telegram from Stephen that alludes to his financial difficulties. Mulligan then presents his own ""play"" idea, ""Everyman His Own Wife,"" further ridiculing Stephen. Bloom enters the library, and Mulligan points him out to Haines as a ""wandering jew."" Stephen and Bloom exchange glances before Stephen leaves, followed by Mulligan, who continues his taunts.

This chapter presents a series of brief, interconnected vignettes across Dublin. Father Conmee walks through the city, blessing people and reflecting on his duties. Blazes Boylan is seen buying fruit and a bottle for a lady, flirting with the shopgirl, and making a phone call. Almidano Artifoni encourages Stephen to pursue his singing talent. Miss Dunne, Boylan's secretary, notes his plans. Ned Lambert and J.J. O'Molloy discuss history in a warehouse. Tom Rochford demonstrates his pub turnstile invention. Lenehan and M'Coy discuss Rochford's heroism and Boylan's horse racing bet. The viceregal cavalcade passes, observed by many characters, including Gerty MacDowell. John Henry Menton's hat is crushed in the crowd, and Bloom's attempt to point it out is ignored.

In the Ormond Hotel bar, barmaids Miss Douce and Miss Kennedy observe the viceregal cavalcade. Bloom enters, having bought a book titled ""Sweets of Sin,"" and orders dinner. Simon Dedalus, Father Cowley, and Ben Dollard are also present, drinking and discussing music. Blazes Boylan arrives, flirts with the barmaids, and orders drinks before leaving to meet Molly.

Bloom watches Boylan, feeling a mix of desire and jealousy. Simon Dedalus sings ""M'appari,"" accompanied by Father Cowley on the piano. Bloom reflects on his past intimacy with Molly on Howth and writes a letter to Martha Clifford. Boylan's car jingling away signals his departure to meet Molly. Bloom finishes his letter and posts it, then leaves the hotel, feeling lonely as the music continues.

The chapter is narrated by an unnamed debt collector in Barney Kiernan's pub, along with Joe Hynes. They encounter ""the Citizen,"" a fervent Irish nationalist, and his dog Garryowen. The Citizen expresses strong anti-English and anti-Semitic sentiments. Bloom enters, looking for Martin Cunningham. The Citizen reads newspaper notices, criticizing the press.

Alf Bergan arrives, and a discussion about Paddy Dignam's death leads to confusion, as Alf claims to have seen Dignam alive moments ago, prompting talk of ghosts. Bloom attempts to explain Dignam's insurance policy, but the Citizen and others mock his ""jewish"" financial dealings. Bob Doran, drunk, expresses maudlin sorrow for Dignam. Alf shows ""hangman's letters,"" and Bloom's scientific explanation for a hanged man's erection further enrages the Citizen.

The conversation shifts to Irish sports and nationalism. Lenehan reveals that ""Throwaway"" won the Gold Cup, and Boylan lost money on ""Sceptre."" The Citizen continues his tirade against England and Jews, advocating for Irish independence. Bloom tries to promote universal love, but the Citizen dismisses him. As Bloom leaves, the Citizen throws a biscuit tin at him, narrowly missing. Bloom escapes in a jaunting car, pursued by the Citizen and his dog, and the chapter concludes with a fantastical vision of Bloom ascending to heaven as ""ben Bloom Elijah.""

Gerty MacDowell, Edy Boardman, and Cissy Caffrey are on Sandymount strand with two young boys and a baby. Gerty, who has a limp, is engrossed in romantic fantasies, dressed carefully to attract attention. She notices a gentleman in black (Bloom) sitting alone. The children's ball rolls near Gerty, and she kicks it, subtly revealing her legs to Bloom.

Gerty is aware of Bloom's gaze, feeling a blush and imagining him as a strong, understanding man. Inside a nearby church, a temperance retreat is underway, with hymns and a sermon. Gerty's thoughts are filled with longing for love and a husband, reflecting on her father's drinking and her own physical ""shortcoming."" As the other girls leave, Gerty exchanges a final, lingering glance with Bloom. She waves a piece of wadding at him. Bloom watches her limp away, realizing her disability, and reflects on women, desire, and his own past. He writes and then effaces the letters ""I. AM. A."" in the sand, as church bells chime and a cuckoo clock sounds.

The scene is the National Maternity Hospital, where Mrs. Mina Purefoy is in prolonged labor. The narrative style shifts, mimicking various historical English prose styles, reflecting the process of gestation. Stephen, Lynch, Dixon, Madden, Costello, Lenehan, and Crotthers are present, drinking and discussing birth, death, and morality. Bloom arrives, concerned for Mrs. Purefoy, and learns of the death of his friend, Dr. O'Hare. The men debate the ethics of difficult births.

Stephen delivers a complex speech about fatherhood, the ""eternal son,"" and the ""sin against the Holy Ghost,"" linking it to his Shakespeare theory. Mulligan enters, mocking Stephen's ""unborn child in his brain."" The men discuss theories of conception and birth. A storm breaks outside, and Stephen is frightened, but Bloom calms him, explaining it as a ""natural phenomenon."" Mrs. Purefoy gives birth to a healthy boy, and the news is celebrated. Mulligan proposes a ""national fertilizing farm"" where he would ""fecundate"" women. The men continue to drink and discuss, with Bloom offering philosophical reflections. They eventually leave the hospital, drunk and boisterous, heading for a pub.

Stephen and Lynch are in Nighttown, Dublin's red-light district. Stephen, heavily intoxicated, experiences vivid hallucinations, including his mother's ghost, who reproaches him. Bloom, following Stephen, tries to protect him from the dangers of the street. Bloom also hallucinates, seeing himself as a civic leader, a Messiah, and a victim of persecution. He is accused of various crimes and humiliated by Bello, a masculine version of the brothel owner, Bella Cohen. Bello forces Bloom into female attire and rides him like a horse.

Milly Bloom appears in a vision, noting Bloom's aging. Bello mocks Bloom's life and his wife's infidelity. Bloom is condemned and symbolically burned, but then rises as a ""new womanly man."" In a fit of rage, Stephen smashes a chandelier with his ashplant, causing chaos. Bloom tries to calm Bella, offering to pay for the damage, and uses masonic signs to assert his respectability. Corny Kelleher arrives in a hackney car. Bloom finds Stephen unconscious after being struck by Private Carr. Corny Kelleher offers Stephen a ride home. Bloom stays with Stephen, reflecting on his face, which reminds him of Rudy. A vision of Rudy, a ""fairy boy,"" appears.

Bloom helps the dazed Stephen, brushing him off and offering him a drink. They decide to go to the cabman's shelter near Butt Bridge, walking after failing to hail a cab. Bloom warns Stephen about the dangers of Nighttown and criticizes Mulligan and Stephen's other friends for abandoning him. Stephen identifies the one who remained as Judas. They pass Gumley, a former friend of Stephen's father, now a corporation watchman. Corley, a dissolute acquaintance, begs Stephen for money, which Stephen lends him.

Bloom observes Corley, noting his dilapidated state. Bloom and Stephen discuss the encounter, and Bloom expresses concern for Stephen's financial struggles, asking why he left his father's house. Stephen replies, ""To seek misfortune."" Bloom mentions meeting Simon Dedalus and suggests Stephen could return home. Bloom expresses his distrust of Mulligan. They enter the cabman's shelter, where they are met with stares.

Bloom orders coffee and a bun for Stephen. The red-bearded sailor, Murphy, asks Stephen his name and mentions knowing Simon Dedalus. Murphy tells stories of his travels and shows a tattoo. Bloom reflects on the sailor's tales and his own aspirations for a concert tour for Molly. Bloom and Stephen discuss the streetwalker and the need for licensed prostitution. They debate the nature of the soul and the existence of God. Bloom offers Stephen a place to sleep at his house.

Bloom and Stephen walk back to Eccles Street, discussing music, literature, Ireland, and other topics. Bloom has forgotten his latchkey and climbs over the area railings to enter his house, then lights a candle and the gas. Stephen follows him into the kitchen. Bloom makes cocoa for them, reflecting on his betting tickets and past intuitions about the Gold Cup race. He is satisfied with having sustained no loss and brought gain to others.

They drink cocoa, and Bloom reflects on literature and his own youthful poetry. Their ages and potential future paths are contrasted. Previous encounters between them are recalled. Bloom's ""domestic problem"" of ""what to do with our wives"" is explored, with hypothetical solutions. Molly's intellectual deficiencies and Bloom's attempts to remedy them are listed. They discuss Hebrew and Irish languages, writing glyphs in a book. Stephen hears the ""accumulation of the past,"" and Bloom sees the ""predestination of a future.""

Bloom's past career possibilities are listed. Stephen chants the legend of ""Little Harry Hughes and the Jew's Daughter,"" a story of ritual murder, which Bloom receives with ""mixed feelings."" Bloom reflects on his daughter Milly's life and his cat. He considers the ""monotonous menstruation of simian and (particularly) human females."" Stephen declines Bloom's offer of asylum. Bloom returns the money Stephen lent him. They discuss various future plans, including Italian and vocal lessons for Molly. Bloom reflects on the ""irreparability of the past"" and the ""imprevidibility of the future.""

Stephen affirms his significance as a ""conscious rational animal."" They leave the house, Bloom carrying a candle, Stephen wearing his hat. They observe the night sky, meditating on cosmic and microscopic evolution. Bloom reflects on the moon and woman. They urinate together in the garden, their organs concealed. They observe a shooting star. Bloom unlocks the gate. They take leave of each other, hearing the church bells. Bloom reflects on deceased companions and the coming dawn. He re-enters the house, bumps his head, and observes the rearranged furniture in the front room. He finds betting tickets and reflects on his ""Agendath Netaim"" prospectus. He removes his clothes, finds a bee sting, and scratches himself. He compiles a budget for the day. He removes his boots and socks, picks at a toenail, and inhales its odor, recalling childhood. He meditates on his ultimate ambition: a country residence. He considers various means to wealth. He ponders the question: ""Who was M'Intosh?"" He comprehends the enigma: ""Where was Moses when the candle went out?"" He enumerates the day's imperfections. He recalls his father-in-law, Major Tweedy. He perceives Molly's clothes and personal items, including a steel safety pin. He undresses, puts on his nightshirt, and gets into bed. He encounters new bedlinen, other odors, Molly's presence, and the ""imprint of a human form, male, not his."" He reflects on the series of men who have been with Molly, from Mulvey to Boylan. He feels envy, jealousy, abnegation, and equanimity. He justifies his sentiments, reflecting on the ""preordained frangibility of the hymen."" His final satisfaction is at the ""ubiquity... of adipose anterior and posterior female hemispheres."" He kisses Molly's rump. He then questions Molly, omitting certain details of his day, but including others. He reflects on the ""limitation of fertility"" in their marriage and the ""limitation of activity"" in his relationship with Molly. He lies in bed, contemplating Molly, who is ""fulfilled, recumbent, big with seed.""

Molly Bloom's unpunctuated stream of consciousness begins, reflecting on Bloom's request for breakfast in bed and his past actions. She thinks about her upcoming concert tour and her relationship with Blazes Boylan, remembering their recent intimacy. She recalls her youth in Gibraltar, her first kiss, and her desires. She criticizes Bloom's habits and his ""cracked ideas,"" yet acknowledges his intelligence.

She reflects on her body, her sexuality, and the physical act of love, contrasting her own passionate nature with Bloom's perceived lack of ""spunk."" She thinks about other women, their appearances, and their own desires. She recalls her experiences with childbirth and the challenges of motherhood. Her thoughts drift to her past lovers and the men who have desired her.

Molly remembers the day Bloom proposed to her on Howth Head, recalling the ""long kiss"" and her feeling like a ""flower of the mountain."" She thinks about the simple joys of nature and expresses her belief in God, despite Bloom's atheism. She considers the possibility of a new lover, a ""handsome young poet,"" and imagines herself in a new life.

She expresses frustration with men's expectations and their inability to understand women. She thinks about her own power and desirability, and her longing for passion. She recalls various memories, from her childhood in Gibraltar to her musical performances. The soliloquy concludes with Molly's powerful affirmation of life, desire, and her own self, repeating ""yes I will Yes."""
