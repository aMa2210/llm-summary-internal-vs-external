A Doll_s House-Henrik Ibsen,"The play opens on Christmas Eve in the comfortably furnished home of Nora and Torvald Helmer. Nora, in high spirits, returns with Christmas gifts, playfully defying her husband Torvald's rule by secretly eating macaroons. Torvald, who has just been promoted to Bank Manager, addresses Nora with affectionate but diminishing pet names like ""little lark"" and ""little squirrel,"" and scolds her for being a ""spendthrift."" He prides himself on avoiding debt and maintaining a respectable home. Nora, however, expresses joy at their newfound financial security, hinting that their ""hard times"" are over.

Their conversation is interrupted by the arrival of Mrs. Linde, an old school friend of Nora's, who has come to town seeking work after years of hardship. Mrs. Linde is a widow who previously married for financial security to support her sick mother and younger brothers, but was left with nothing after her husband's death. Nora, eager to help, promises to speak to Torvald about finding her a position at the bank.

In a moment of confidence, Nora reveals her biggest secret to Mrs. Linde: eight years ago, when Torvald was gravely ill, doctors advised a year in Italy. Torvald believed the money came from Nora's dying father, but Nora confesses she procured the 250 pounds by forging her father's signature on a loan bond with lawyer Nils Krogstad. She has since been secretly repaying the debt through odd jobs and careful household budgeting, hiding her efforts from Torvald, who would have been humiliated by owing her money and by her taking on debt. She has been looking forward to the New Year when Torvald's new salary would allow her to finally pay off the remaining debt and be ""free from care.""

Shortly after, Krogstad arrives to speak with Torvald about bank business. Mrs. Linde is visibly distressed upon seeing him, revealing a past connection between them. Doctor Rank, a close family friend who visits daily, also arrives and exits Torvald's study, referring to Krogstad as having a ""diseased moral character.""

Krogstad confronts Nora, revealing that Torvald intends to dismiss him from his post at the bank and give it to Mrs. Linde. He pressures Nora to use her influence to keep him on staff, threatening to expose her forgery. Nora, initially defiant, is terrified when Krogstad presents the bond, pointing out that her father's signature was dated three days after his death. Nora confesses to the forgery, explaining she did it to save Torvald's life and couldn't burden her dying father with the truth or disclose Torvald's critical condition to him. Krogstad warns her that ""the law cares nothing about motives"" and that if he loses his position, she will ""lose yours with me."" After Krogstad leaves, Nora is consumed by fear, particularly after Torvald's earlier pronouncement that a deceitful parent ""poisons the whole life of a home"" and infects their children. She stops her children from coming near her.

Act II begins with Nora’s growing anxiety. She considers fleeing and questions the nurse about whether children forget their mothers. Mrs. Linde returns to help Nora mend her Tarantella dress for the upcoming fancy-dress ball. Nora reveals to Mrs. Linde that Doctor Rank is dying from a hereditary spinal disease, a consequence of his father's dissolute life. Mrs. Linde suspects Doctor Rank might be Nora's secret lender, which Nora denies.

Nora attempts to ask Doctor Rank for help with her ""tremendously big favour,"" believing he is her truest friend. However, before she can reveal her predicament, Doctor Rank confesses his deep love for her. His confession makes it impossible for Nora to ask him for such a personal sacrifice, as it would be exploiting his feelings.

Krogstad reappears, having learned of his dismissal. He informs Nora that he has sent a letter detailing her forgery to Torvald. He now demands not money, but a higher position at the bank, asserting that he will become Torvald's ""right hand."" He implies that if Nora were to take extreme measures, it would be futile, as he would still have power over Torvald. Krogstad drops the letter into the Helmers' locked letter-box and leaves.

Nora is distraught, seeing the letter through the glass. Mrs. Linde, learning the full extent of Nora's crime, offers to intercede with Krogstad, revealing her own past relationship with him. To delay Torvald from reading the letter, Nora frantically begs him to help her practice her Tarantella dance, insisting he focus entirely on her and not open any mail until after the ball. Torvald, flattered, agrees, amused by her ""childish nervousness.""

In Act III, Mrs. Linde waits for Krogstad at the Helmers' home after the ball. When he arrives, she explains why she left him years ago: she sacrificed her personal feelings for him to support her family. Now, her family no longer needs her, and she feels ""unspeakably empty."" She proposes they reunite, suggesting they need each other and that she can be a mother to his children. Krogstad is overjoyed and believes they can now build a life together and clear his name. He wants to retrieve his letter from Torvald's letter-box. However, Mrs. Linde persuades him not to, explaining that she has witnessed ""incredible things in this house"" and believes the ""unhappy secret must be disclosed"" to force a complete understanding between Nora and Torvald, free from concealment and falsehood. She takes responsibility for leaving the letter.

Torvald and Nora return from the ball. Torvald is flushed with desire, playfully dominating Nora and boasting about her success at the dance. He expresses his longing to be alone with her, but Nora, repulsed, resists his advances. Doctor Rank then makes a final, sombre visit. He hands Torvald two cards with black crosses on them, signifying his imminent death and his intention to withdraw and die alone.

After Rank leaves, Torvald checks the letter-box, despite Nora's desperate attempts to distract him. He finds Krogstad's letter and reads it. Enraged, he condemns Nora as a ""hypocrite, a liar—worse, worse—a criminal!"" He rails against her ""father's want of principle"" and declares she has destroyed his happiness and ruined his future by placing him under Krogstad's power. He locks the hall door, telling her she will remain in the house but will not be allowed to raise their children, stating their marriage will continue only ""in the eyes of the world"" to preserve appearances.

Just then, the maid delivers a second letter to Nora. Torvald snatches it and reads it. His fury instantly turns to overwhelming joy: Krogstad has returned the bond, expressing regret and repenting, due to ""a happy change in his life"" (his reconciliation with Mrs. Linde). Torvald tears up both letters and the bond, burning them in the stove, declaring they are ""saved"" and ""it's all over!"" He forgives Nora, rationalizing her actions as misguided love and her ""womanly helplessness"" as making her ""doubly attractive."" He expects life to return to normal, promising to shelter and guide his ""scared, helpless darling.""

However, Nora, having changed into her everyday clothes, tells Torvald they need to have a ""serious conversation""—their first in eight years of marriage. She asserts that he has never understood her and that she has been ""greatly wronged"" by both her father and him. She explains that she has lived as his ""doll-wife,"" just as she was her ""papa's doll-child,"" merely performing tricks and making nothing of her life. She confesses she has never been truly happy, only merry.

Nora reveals that the ""wonderful thing"" she had hoped for—Torvald taking all the blame and responsibility for her crime—did not happen. His reaction revealed he would sacrifice her honor, but not his own. She realizes she has been living with a ""strange man"" and can no longer be his wife. She declares she must leave to ""educate myself"" and ""understand myself and everything about me."" Torvald protests, forbidding her to leave and emphasizing her ""sacred duties"" as a wife and mother. Nora counters that she has ""other duties just as sacred""—duties to herself—and that she must learn to think for herself, rather than accepting society's or his views. She no longer believes in his understanding of religion or law, finding them unjust to women.

She calmly states she no longer loves him. Torvald is aghast. Nora explains that her eight years of waiting for him to prove himself the man she thought he was culminated tonight, and he failed. She returns her wedding ring and demands his, setting them both free from all obligations. She states she will not see the children, believing they are in ""better hands"" now. When Torvald asks if she could ever be more than a stranger, Nora replies that the ""most wonderful thing of all"" would have to happen: ""Both you and I would have to be so changed that... our life together would be a real wedlock."" She says goodbye and leaves, shutting the door behind her, leaving Torvald alone with a glimmer of hope for ""the most wonderful thing of all."""
Alice_s Adventures in Wonderland-Lewis Carroll,"This detailed summary recounts the plot of ""Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland"" based solely on the provided text.

The story begins with **Alice**, who is bored sitting on a riverbank with her sister, who is reading a book without pictures or conversations. As Alice contemplates whether to make a daisy-chain, a **White Rabbit with pink eyes** suddenly runs past, exclaiming, ""Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!"" Alice is intrigued when the Rabbit takes a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket and hurries on. Burning with curiosity, Alice follows the Rabbit down a large rabbit-hole without considering how she will get out.

The rabbit-hole plunges suddenly into a very deep well. As Alice falls, she observes cupboards, book-shelves, maps, and pictures adorning the sides. She takes down an empty jar of ""ORANGE MARMALADE"" and places it in a cupboard. During her long descent, she muses about her location (the center of the earth, New Zealand or Australia) and talks aloud to herself about her cat, Dinah. The fall finally ends as she lands unhurt on a heap of sticks and dry leaves.

Alice jumps up and sees the White Rabbit still hurrying along a long passage, muttering about being late. She follows closely but loses sight of him when she turns a corner, finding herself in a long, low hall lit by lamps. All the doors in the hall are locked. She discovers a tiny golden key on a three-legged glass table, but it is too small for any of the visible doors. However, she then finds a small door, about fifteen inches high, hidden behind a low curtain. The golden key fits this lock.

Alice opens the tiny door and sees a beautiful garden, but she is too large to fit through. She wishes she could shrink ""like a telescope."" Returning to the table, she finds a bottle labeled ""DRINK ME."" After prudently checking that it is not marked ""poison,"" she tastes it. Finding its mixed flavor (cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast) very pleasant, she drinks it all. This causes her to shrink to ten inches high, a perfect size for the small door. However, she realizes she left the golden key on the glass table and cannot reach it. She tries to climb a table leg but it is too slippery, and she begins to cry.

Scolding herself, Alice notices a small cake under the table with ""EAT ME"" marked on it. She decides to eat it, hoping it will either make her grow larger to reach the key or smaller to creep under the door. She eats a bit but remains the same size. Disappointed by the ordinary outcome, she finishes the entire cake.

Immediately, Alice grows enormously, becoming more than nine feet high, her head striking the hall's roof. She grabs the key and hurries to the garden door, but she is now far too large, only able to lie on her side and peer into the garden with one eye. She starts crying again, shedding so many tears that a large pool, about four inches deep and reaching halfway down the hall, forms around her.

She hears the **White Rabbit** returning, dressed elaborately with white kid gloves and a fan, muttering about the **Duchess** and being late. Alice, feeling desperate, timidly asks the Rabbit for help. Startled, the Rabbit drops his gloves and fan and flees. Alice picks them up and, fanning herself in the hot hall, begins to question her identity, wondering if she has been changed. She attempts to recite school lessons and poems, but her memory is faulty, and the words come out wrong. She puts on one of the Rabbit's gloves and realizes she is shrinking again. She discovers the fan is causing her to shrink and drops it hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking out of existence.

Now about two feet high, Alice finds the small door shut again and the key still on the table, out of reach. Her foot slips, and she falls into the pool of tears she herself had wept. As she swims, she encounters a **Mouse**. She tries to speak to it, first in a formal way, then in French, asking ""Where is my cat?"" This terrifies the Mouse. Alice apologizes, but then unwisely mentions her cat, Dinah, and her mouse-catching abilities, which deeply offends the Mouse. Alice then tries to talk about dogs, inadvertently mentioning how a farmer's dog kills rats, further angering the Mouse, who swims away. Alice calls after it, promising not to talk about cats or dogs. The Mouse returns, its face pale, and agrees to tell its history on the shore. The pool is now crowded with other creatures, including a **Duck**, a **Dodo**, a **Lory**, and an **Eaglet**. Alice leads them all to the shore.

On the bank, the wet and uncomfortable party discusses how to get dry. The Mouse, taking authority, proposes ""the driest thing I know,"" and begins to recite a dull history lesson about William the Conqueror. The others interrupt, and Alice complains she is still wet. The Dodo then proposes a ""Caucus-race"" as the best way to get dry. This race involves a circular course, no fixed start or end, with everyone running and stopping as they please. After about half an hour, everyone is dry. The Dodo declares the race over, and everyone has won, deserving prizes. Alice distributes comfits from her pocket to everyone. The Mouse then points out Alice needs a prize, so the Dodo solemnly presents her with a thimble from her pocket.

The group then asks the Mouse to tell its promised history, and Alice specifically asks why it hates ""C and D"" (cats and dogs). The Mouse begins a ""long and a sad tale,"" but Alice, looking at its actual long tail, mistakes ""tale"" for ""tail"" and is distracted by the visual shape of the printed poem forming a tail. The Mouse is angered by Alice's inattention and her confusion about a ""knot"" in its ""tale."" Offended, the Mouse walks away. Alice's subsequent remark about her cat Dinah being ""a capital one for catching mice"" and eating ""a little bird as soon as look at it"" causes all the birds and animals to hastily depart, leaving Alice alone and regretful.

Soon, the **White Rabbit** returns, searching frantically for his fan and gloves, muttering about the Duchess and fear of execution. Alice realizes he is searching for the items she picked up earlier, but the great hall and glass table have vanished. The Rabbit mistakes Alice for his housemaid, **Mary Ann**, and imperiously orders her to fetch a pair of gloves and a fan from his house. Frightened, Alice obeys, running to the Rabbit’s house.

Inside, Alice finds a room with a fan and small white kid gloves. She also sees a bottle and, despite no ""DRINK ME"" label, drinks from it, hoping to grow back to her normal size. Instead, she grows rapidly, filling the house. Her head presses against the ceiling, and she has to kneel, then lie down, eventually extending one arm out a window and one foot up the chimney, becoming stuck. The Rabbit arrives outside, calls for Mary Ann, and tries to open the door, but Alice's elbow blocks it. He decides to enter through the window. Alice snatches at the air outside her window, causing a shriek, a fall, and broken glass, which she guesses is the Rabbit falling into a cucumber-frame.

The Rabbit then angrily calls for **Pat** (a **Lizard**), who is ""digging for apples."" Pat identifies Alice's arm in the window. The Rabbit orders him to remove it, leading to more shrieks and broken glass as Alice makes another snatch. A group of creatures then arrive with ladders, planning to go down the chimney. Alice realizes ""Bill"" (the Lizard) is chosen for this task. She kicks her foot down the chimney, sending Bill flying out like a ""Jack-in-the-box."" The Rabbit suggests burning the house down, but Alice threatens to set Dinah on them, causing a momentary silence. They then decide to throw pebbles at the house. The pebbles turn into little cakes on the floor. Alice eats one, correctly guessing it will make her shrink. She shrinks small enough to exit the house and runs into a thick wood, escaping the crowd of animals (including Bill, being revived).

In the wood, Alice plans to grow back to her right size and find the beautiful garden. She encounters an enormous **Puppy** and, after a playful but terrifying interaction with a stick, escapes while the puppy is resting. She realizes she needs to eat or drink something to grow. She finds a large mushroom and, looking over its edge, sees a large blue **Caterpillar** sitting on top, smoking a hookah.

The Caterpillar asks Alice, ""Who are _you_?"" Alice explains her identity crisis due to constantly changing sizes. The Caterpillar dismisses her confusion, asking her to recite ""You are old, Father William,"" which Alice performs with altered words. The Caterpillar declares her recitation ""wrong from beginning to end."" When Alice expresses a desire to be a ""little larger"" than three inches (the Caterpillar's height), the Caterpillar takes offense. As it crawls away, it tells Alice that ""One side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you shorter,"" referring to the mushroom.

Alice breaks off a piece of the mushroom from each side. She nibbles the right-hand piece and shrinks rapidly until her chin is pressed against her foot. She quickly eats some of the left-hand piece. Her head becomes free, but her neck has grown immensely long, like a serpent's. She manages to bend her neck down towards her hands but is then attacked by a **Pigeon**, which screams ""Serpent!"" The Pigeon accuses her of being a serpent who eats eggs, complaining about having to guard its nest. Alice tries to explain she is a ""little girl,"" but the Pigeon doesn't believe her due to her long neck. Alice clarifies she doesn't eat raw eggs. The Pigeon, sulkily, tells her to be off. Alice, untangling her neck from branches, remembers the mushroom pieces and carefully nibbles from them alternately until she returns to her usual height.

She then sees a small house, about four feet high. Realizing she is too big to approach it without frightening anyone, she nibbles the shrinking mushroom piece again until she is nine inches high.

She approaches the house and witnesses a **Fish-Footman** deliver a croquet invitation from the **Queen** to the **Duchess** to a **Frog-Footman**. Alice laughs, then tries to enter the house. The Frog-Footman explains that knocking is useless due to the noise inside (howling, sneezing, crashing) and his position on her side of the door. A plate then flies out of the house, narrowly missing the Footman's head. Frustrated by his nonsensical replies, Alice opens the door and enters.

Inside, she finds a smoky kitchen. The **Duchess** is nursing a constantly howling and sneezing **Baby**. A **Cook** stirs a cauldron of soup and throws kitchenware at the Duchess and baby, who take no notice. A grinning **Cheshire Cat** sits by the fire. Alice asks the Duchess why her cat grins, learning it's a ""Cheshire cat."" The Duchess, after calling the baby ""Pig!"", tells Alice that all cats can grin, and that Alice ""don't know much."" Alice tries to change the subject as the Cook throws more objects. The Duchess offers moralistic proverbs, which Alice attempts to correct with facts, leading the Duchess to exclaim ""Chop off her head!""

The Duchess then gives the screaming Baby to Alice, telling her to nurse it while she goes to play croquet with the Queen. Alice struggles to hold the oddly shaped, snorting baby. She carries it outside, deciding it would be murder to leave it. She notices the baby's pig-like features developing further. Alice warns the baby that if it turns into a pig, she'll have nothing to do with it. The baby grunts violently again, and Alice realizes it has fully transformed into a pig. She sets it down, and it trots off into the wood.

Alice then encounters the **Cheshire Cat** sitting on a tree branch. She asks it which way to go. The Cat explains it depends on her destination. When Alice says she doesn't care, the Cat replies it doesn't matter which way she goes. The Cat then points out the **Hatter** and **March Hare** live in different directions, both of whom are mad. Alice expresses reluctance to go among mad people, but the Cat insists everyone there is mad, including Alice and himself, offering his own opposite behaviors (growling when pleased, wagging tail when angry) as proof. The Cat asks if Alice will play croquet with the Queen, says she'll see him there, and vanishes. It reappears to ask about the baby (Alice tells him it turned into a pig), then vanishes again, leaving only its grin, which fades slowly.

Alice walks towards the March Hare's house, which has ear-shaped chimneys and a fur-thatched roof. She eats more mushroom to grow to two feet high before timidly approaching.

She finds the **March Hare** and **Hatter** having a **Mad Tea-Party** at a table under a tree, with a **Dormouse** asleep between them. They tell Alice there's no room, but she sits down anyway. The March Hare offers her non-existent wine. The Hatter comments on her hair. The Hatter poses a riddle: ""Why is a raven like a writing-desk?"", but neither he nor the March Hare knows the answer. They argue about the meaning of words. The Hatter checks his watch, which only tells the day of the month, and blames the March Hare for putting butter in its works. The Hatter explains that he and ""Time"" (a personified entity) had a quarrel in March at the Queen of Hearts' concert, where he sang ""Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!"" and the Queen ordered ""Off with his head!"" As a result, it is now ""always six o'clock"" (tea-time) for them, so they perpetually move around the table as things get used up.

The March Hare then suggests Alice tell a story, but she doesn't know one, so they demand the Dormouse tell one. The Dormouse, after being pinched awake, begins a story about three sisters (Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie) who lived at the bottom of a ""treacle-well"" and lived on treacle. Alice questions this, but the others silence her. The Dormouse then says they learned to draw, and drew ""Treacle."" The Hatter demands a clean cup, causing them all to shift places around the table, leaving Alice in a worse spot. Alice tries to clarify how they drew treacle from a well they were _in_. The Dormouse, getting sleepy, says they drew things that begin with ""M,"" such as ""mouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness."" Alice, disgusted by their rudeness, walks off. The Dormouse falls asleep, and the others ignore her, attempting to put the Dormouse into the teapot.

Alice decides it was the ""stupidest tea-party"" ever. She notices a door in a tree and enters it, finding herself back in the long hall near the glass table. This time, she retrieves the golden key and, by carefully nibbling her mushroom, adjusts her size to about a foot high, finally entering the beautiful garden.

In the garden, Alice observes three gardeners (named Five, Seven, and Two, shaped like playing cards) frantically painting white roses red on a rose-tree. They explain they mistakenly planted a white rose-tree where a red one should be, and the Queen will order their execution if she finds out. Suddenly, Five shouts ""The Queen! The Queen!"", and the gardeners fall flat on their faces. A grand procession enters, including soldiers (clubs), courtiers (diamonds), royal children (hearts), guests (Kings and Queens, including the **White Rabbit**), the **Knave of Hearts** carrying the King's crown, and finally, **THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS**.

Alice remains standing. The Queen sternly asks who she is. Alice introduces herself politely, deciding she needn't fear them as they are ""only a pack of cards."" The Queen then asks who the prostrate gardeners are. Alice says she doesn't know, to which the Queen screams ""Off with her head!"" Alice, loudly and decidedly, says ""Nonsense!"", silencing the Queen. The King timidly intervenes, noting Alice is ""only a child."" The Queen then orders the Knave to turn the gardeners over. They rise and bow. The Queen asks what they've been doing. Two explains they were painting the roses red. The Queen, seeing the roses, again shouts ""Off with their heads!"" Soldiers prepare to execute them, but Alice puts the gardeners into a large flower-pot, protecting them. The soldiers search and then march off, reporting that the gardeners' ""heads are gone.""

The Queen then asks Alice if she can play croquet. Alice agrees. The croquet game is chaotic: the ground is ridged, the balls are live hedgehogs, the mallets are live flamingoes, and the soldiers must double up to form arches, but they constantly move. Alice struggles to control her flamingo and finds the game very difficult. The players quarrel, and the Queen frequently screams ""Off with his head!"" or ""Off with her head!"", sentencing many players to execution. Alice, uneasy, looks for an escape.

She sees the **Cheshire Cat's** grin appear in the air, followed by its head. She describes the confusing game to the Cat. The Cat asks how she likes the Queen. Alice, noticing the Queen nearby, quickly changes her critical comment to a polite one. The King, intrigued by the Cat's disembodied head, orders it removed. The Queen agrees, shouting ""Off with his head!"" The King goes to fetch the executioner. Alice leaves to find her hedgehog.

When Alice returns, a large crowd is gathered around the Cat's head, as the **Executioner**, King, and Queen are arguing. The Executioner claims he cannot cut off a head without a body. The King argues any head can be beheaded. The Queen threatens to execute everyone if the matter isn't resolved. Alice suggests asking the Duchess, to whom the Cat belongs. The Queen orders the Duchess fetched from prison. As the Executioner leaves, the Cat's head begins to fade, completely disappearing by the time the Executioner returns with the **Duchess**. The King and Executioner frantically search for the vanished head, while the others return to the game.

The Duchess affectionately greets Alice, her temper seemingly improved. She shares her moralistic philosophies about how different substances affect people's temperaments (pepper for hot, vinegar for sour, etc.), much to Alice's discomfort as the Duchess leans her sharp chin on Alice's shoulder. The Queen reappears, frowning. She warns the Duchess to leave instantly or face execution. The Duchess vanishes in a moment.

The Queen orders Alice to continue the game. The King, unseen by the Queen, quietly pardons all the imprisoned players. The Queen and Alice then set off to find the **Mock Turtle**, as the Queen wants him to tell Alice his history. They find a **Gryphon** asleep in the sun. The Queen orders the Gryphon to take Alice to the Mock Turtle, then leaves to oversee ""executions"" (which the Gryphon later tells Alice are ""all her fancy"" and ""they never executes nobody"").

The Gryphon leads Alice to the Mock Turtle, who sits sadly on a rock, sighing, though the Gryphon says his sorrow is also ""all his fancy."" The Mock Turtle, sobbing, recounts his history, claiming he ""was a real Turtle."" He tells them he went to school in the sea, taught by a turtle they called ""Tortoise because he taught us."" Alice interrupts, questioning this, and is scolded by the Gryphon. The Mock Turtle describes their lessons: ""Reeling and Writhing,"" and branches of Arithmetic like ""Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, and Derision."" He also learned ""Mystery, ancient and modern, with Seaography,"" and ""Drawling, Stretching, and Fainting in Coils."" The Gryphon mentions his own Classics master, an old crab, who taught ""Laughing and Grief."" The Gryphon explains their ""lessons"" ""lessen from day to day,"" from ten hours to nine, and so on. The Gryphon eventually cuts off the Mock Turtle's story of lessons.

The Gryphon then asks the Mock Turtle to describe the games. The Mock Turtle, still sobbing, describes the ""Lobster Quadrille,"" a dance involving two lines of sea creatures partnered with lobsters, throwing the lobsters out to sea, swimming after them, turning somersaults, and changing partners. He and the Gryphon demonstrate the first figure, dancing around Alice while the Mock Turtle sings ""Will you walk a little faster?"" Alice finds the song and dance very interesting. The Mock Turtle then explains that whitings (a type of fish) have their tails in their mouths because they got thrown out to sea with the lobsters and fell a long way, getting their tails caught. The Gryphon adds that whitings ""do the boots and shoes"" for undersea creatures (like blacking for land shoes), and that undersea shoes are made of ""Soles and eels."" The Mock Turtle insists wise fish always travel ""with what porpoise,"" mispronouncing ""purpose.""

The Gryphon then asks Alice to tell her own adventures. Alice begins, starting from seeing the White Rabbit and her subsequent size changes and incorrect recitations. When she reaches the part about saying ""You are old, Father William"" differently to the Caterpillar, the Mock Turtle finds it ""very curious."" The Gryphon orders Alice to recite ""'Tis the voice of the sluggard',"" but Alice, her head full of the Lobster Quadrille, recites it incorrectly as ""'Tis the voice of the Lobster."" The Mock Turtle finds it ""uncommon nonsense"" and demands an explanation. Alice then recites another verse incorrectly, about an Owl and Panther sharing a pie, but the Mock Turtle interrupts, demanding explanations. The Gryphon tells Alice to stop reciting.

The Gryphon asks if they should try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille or if the Mock Turtle should sing a song. Alice eagerly requests a song. The Mock Turtle, sighing and sobbing, sings ""Turtle Soup."" As he finishes, a cry of ""The trial's beginning!"" is heard in the distance. The Gryphon grabs Alice's hand and hurries off with her towards the sound.

They arrive at the trial, where the **King and Queen of Hearts** are seated on their throne, surrounded by a crowd of birds, beasts, and cards. The **Knave of Hearts** stands in chains, guarded by soldiers, accused of stealing tarts. The **White Rabbit** serves as the herald. Alice notes a large dish of tarts on a table in the court. The King, wearing his crown over a wig, acts as the judge, and twelve ""creatures"" (animals and birds) act as jurymen, busily writing on slates. The Gryphon explains they are writing their names. Alice loudly calls them ""Stupid things!"", which they dutifully record. Alice then removes Bill the Lizard's squeaky pencil, forcing him to write with his finger, which leaves no mark.

The White Rabbit reads the accusation: a poem stating that ""The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts, / All on a summer day: / The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts, / And took them quite away!"" The King calls for a verdict, but the Rabbit insists there is more evidence.

The first witness is the **Hatter**, who arrives with a teacup and bread-and-butter, claiming he hadn't finished his tea. The King asks when he started. The Hatter, March Hare, and Dormouse give conflicting dates (14th, 15th, 16th of March), which the jury writes down and adds up. The King orders the Hatter to remove his hat. The Hatter says it's not his, but he keeps hats to sell. The King exclaims ""Stolen!"", which the jury notes. The King demands the Hatter give his evidence without nervousness, threatening execution. The Hatter, growing more flustered, bites his teacup instead of his food.

During the Hatter's testimony, Alice begins to grow larger again, making the Dormouse (sitting next to her) complain about being squeezed. The Queen stares at the Hatter, and demands the list of singers from the last concert, causing the Hatter to tremble. The King angrily repeats his demand for evidence. The Hatter gives a rambling, nonsensical account about tea, bread-and-butter, and ""twinkling,"" which the King tries to make sense of. He mentions the March Hare and Dormouse, but the March Hare denies his statements, and the Dormouse is asleep. The Hatter cannot remember what the Dormouse said. The King threatens execution if he doesn't remember. Alice notes that a cheering guinea-pig is ""suppressed"" by being stuffed into a canvas bag and sat upon. The Hatter, dismissed, hurries out of court, and the Queen orders his head chopped off outside, but he is gone.

The second witness is the **Duchess's Cook**, who causes everyone to sneeze with her pepper-box. She refuses to give evidence. The King, advised by the White Rabbit, cross-examines her, asking what tarts are made of. The Cook says ""Pepper, mostly."" The sleeping Dormouse interjects ""Treacle."" The Queen, enraged, orders the Dormouse beheaded, turned out, suppressed, pinched, and its whiskers cut off. In the ensuing confusion, the Cook disappears.

The King, relieved, calls for the next witness, telling the Queen she must cross-examine this one. To Alice's great surprise, the White Rabbit calls out the name ""**Alice!**""

Alice cries ""Here!"" and jumps up, forgetting her immense size. She tips over the jury-box with her skirt, sending all the jurymen sprawling. She apologizes and hastily gathers them, putting Bill the Lizard right-side up after mistakenly placing him head downwards. The King demands the trial proceed only when all jurymen are in place.

The King asks Alice what she knows about the business. Alice replies, ""Nothing whatever."" The King declares this ""very important,"" but the White Rabbit quickly corrects him to ""unimportant."" The King agrees, muttering to himself. The King then reads ""Rule Forty-two"" from his notebook: ""_All persons more than a mile high to leave the court_."" Everyone looks at Alice, who is now very large. She denies being a mile high, but the King and Queen insist she is. Alice refuses to leave, arguing it's an invented rule. The King claims it's the oldest rule; Alice retorts it should be ""Number One"" then. The King, looking pale, tells the jury to consider their verdict.

The White Rabbit interrupts again, stating he has new evidence: a paper, a letter from the prisoner. He reads it, revealing it to be a set of nonsensical verses without a signature or direction. A juryman asks if it's the prisoner's handwriting; the Rabbit says no. The King deduces the Knave imitated someone else's hand. The Knave protests he didn't write it and there's no name. The King asserts that not signing it implies mischief. The Queen declares this ""proves his guilt."" Alice argues it proves nothing since they don't even know what the verses mean.

The King orders the Rabbit to read the verses. The White Rabbit reads the poem, which is full of vague references to ""her,"" ""him,"" ""them,"" inability to swim, returning items, and an ""obstacle."" The King finds it ""the most important piece of evidence yet."" Alice, now grown to her full size and fearless, interrupts, stating she doesn't believe there's ""an atom of meaning in it"" and offers sixpence to anyone who can explain it. The jury writes down Alice's statement. The King attempts to interpret the verses, connecting parts of the poem to the Knave and the tarts, but Alice points out inconsistencies. The King triumphantly points to the tarts on the table as proof they returned. He also questions the Queen about a line about ""fits,"" and the Queen furiously denies having any, throwing an inkstand at Bill the Lizard, who then uses the ink trickling down his face to write. The King makes a pun about the words not ""fitting"" the Queen.

The King orders the jury to consider their verdict. The Queen interjects, demanding ""Sentence first—verdict afterwards."" Alice loudly calls this ""Stuff and nonsense!"" The Queen, turning purple with rage, screams ""Off with her head!"" But Alice, now at her full size, defiantly declares, ""Who cares for you? You're nothing but a pack of cards!""

At this, the entire pack of cards rises into the air and flies down upon her. Alice screams, half in fright and half in anger, and tries to beat them off. Suddenly, she finds herself lying on the riverbank, her head in her sister's lap, as her sister gently brushes dead leaves from her face.

Alice's sister wakes her, remarking on her long sleep. Alice recounts her ""curious dream"" to her sister. After Alice finishes, her sister kisses her and sends her off for tea. Alice runs off, thinking about her wonderful dream.

Alice's sister remains on the bank, leaning her head on her hand, watching the setting sun, and dreaming of Alice's adventures. She imagines the White Rabbit, the frightened Mouse, the tea-party, the Queen's shrill cries, the pig-baby, the Gryphon, the Lizard's pencil, the suppressed guinea-pigs, and the Mock Turtle's sobs. She knows that if she opens her eyes, all these fantastical elements will revert to ordinary sounds of nature: rustling grass, rippling water, tinkling sheep-bells, a shepherd boy's voice, and farmyard noises. Lastly, she pictures Alice as a grown woman, sharing these strange tales with other children, retaining her childhood's loving heart, and finding joy in their simple lives, remembering her own happy summer days."
Anna Karenina-Leo Tolstoy,"The provided text, titled ""ANNA KARENINA,"" presents a detailed plot across several parts and chapters, focusing on the interwoven lives of several families in 19th-century Russia.

**PART ONE**

The narrative begins in the Oblonskys’ house, in a state of ""confusion."" The wife, Darya Alexandrovna (Dolly), has discovered her husband, Prince Stepan Arkadyevitch Oblonsky (Stiva), is having an affair with their French governess. Dolly announces she can no longer live with him, and the household is in turmoil. Stiva wakes in his study, recalling the quarrel and his ""idiotic smile"" that seemed to make things worse. He feels at fault but also resentful of Dolly's unforgiving nature. He rationalizes his infidelity, believing Dolly, being ""worn-out,"" should be more understanding. His valet, Matvey, informs him his sister, Anna Arkadyevna, is arriving from Petersburg, hoping she can reconcile the couple. The nurse, Matrona Philimonovna, urges Stiva to beg Dolly's forgiveness for the children's sake.

Stiva then attends to his daily routine, reading a liberal newspaper and thinking about his financial difficulties, including the sale of his wife's forest, which is complicated by their marital discord. He interacts with his children, Tanya and Grisha, feeling guilt when Tanya blushes for his pretense of cheerfulness. He decides to confront Dolly.

Dolly is found trying to pack, contemplating leaving but realizing it's impossible due to her children and her enduring love for Stiva. She attempts to appear stern but shows her suffering. Stiva, timidly, mentions Anna's arrival. Dolly screams at him, expressing her loathing for his ""passion"" and ordering him away. Stiva, weeping, begs her to consider the children. Dolly, though softening and calling him ""Stiva,"" recoils from his touch, calling him ""loathsome"" and a ""stranger."" A child's cry draws her away. She threatens to expose him to the servants. Stiva leaves, bothered by her ""vulgarity.""

Stepan Arkadyevitch goes to his government office, where he holds a respected position obtained through his brother-in-law, Alexey Alexandrovitch Karenin (Anna's husband). He is widely liked for his good humor. He is joined by his old friend, Konstantin Dmitrievitch Levin, a country gentleman. They share a playful banter, with Stiva mocking Levin's rural life. Levin is in Moscow to propose to Kitty Shtcherbatskaya, Dolly's younger sister. He has long been in love with the Shtcherbatsky family but feels unworthy of Kitty. He had left Moscow abruptly two months prior due to his doubts but is now resolved to propose.

Levin visits his half-brother, Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev, a philosopher, who is discussing deep philosophical questions with a professor. Levin finds their debate abstract. Sergey Ivanovitch informs Levin that their estranged brother, Nikolay, is in Moscow. Levin is horrified, as Nikolay is a ruined man with a scandalous past, but resolves to visit him after seeing Kitty.

Levin, nervous, goes to the Zoological Gardens, where Kitty is skating. He is overcome by her radiant beauty. Kitty approaches him, they exchange pleasantries, and she invites him to skate. He is elated. When he tells her his stay depends on her, she becomes reserved. Levin feels he has offended her. Kitty leaves with her mother, Princess Shtcherbatskaya, who gives Levin a stiff invitation to visit on Thursday, which Kitty softens. Stepan Arkadyevitch arrives and invites Levin to dine, which he accepts with ecstasy.

At the restaurant, Levin is uncomfortable with the opulent setting. Stepan Arkadyevitch, ordering an extravagant meal, teases Levin about his mood. Levin criticizes city life. Stiva then reveals he knows Levin is in love with Kitty and that Dolly, with her foresight, believes Kitty will be his wife. Levin is overjoyed. He confesses his past sins, feeling unworthy. Stiva then asks Levin for advice on his own infidelity, describing his mistress as a loving creature. Levin expresses moral revulsion for ""fallen women,"" comparing them to ""vermin,"" and asserts that life should be ""all of a piece."" Stiva argues for the complexity of life, with ""light and shadow."" They feel a distance between them. Stiva leaves for another engagement, while Levin, paying the bill, heads to Kitty's.

Kitty, 18, is a social success. Her father favors Levin, but her mother wants a brilliant match with Vronsky, a wealthy and charming officer. The princess is anxious about Vronsky's intentions. With Levin's return, she fears Kitty might refuse Vronsky out of a sense of honor. Kitty, though desiring Vronsky, is wounded by her mother's mercenary motives.

At the ball, Kitty feels intense anticipation. Levin arrives early, intending to propose. He asks her to marry him. Kitty is ecstatic but remembers Vronsky and hastily refuses Levin. Levin is crushed. The princess, entering, is relieved. Countess Nordston teases Levin. Vronsky arrives, and Kitty's bright eyes confirm to Levin her love for Vronsky. Levin observes Vronsky's humble submission to Anna. The old prince, seeing Vronsky, shows him coldness. The conversation turns to spiritualism, which Levin disdains. Levin leaves, heartbroken by Kitty's joyful interaction with Vronsky.

Kitty reflects on her refusal of Levin, feeling remorse but also justified by her love for Vronsky. The prince and princess argue over Kitty's future. The prince blames the princess for chasing Vronsky, calling him a ""peacock."" The princess is disturbed.

Vronsky, who has a history of fleeting affairs, had been charmed by Kitty's innocence but had no intention of marriage. He felt a strong, pure connection with her after the ball and believed she loved him. He returned home content.

Vronsky meets Stepan Arkadyevitch at the Petersburg railway station. Stiva tells Vronsky about Levin's proposal to Kitty, implying Vronsky is the better match. Vronsky feels triumphant. Anna Karenina, Stiva's sister and Vronsky's mother's fellow traveler, arrives. Vronsky is immediately struck by Anna's ""caressing and soft"" expression and her ""suppressed eagerness."" A railway guard is crushed to death by a train. Anna is agitated, calling it an ""omen of evil."" Vronsky, noticing her distress, gives money to the assistant for the widow. Stiva praises Vronsky. Anna then confides in Stiva about his marital problems. Vronsky's mother tells him Anna is ""very sweet"" and that he is ""in perfect love"" (with Kitty). Vronsky coldly deflects. Anna, saying goodbye to Vronsky's mother, gives Vronsky an ""energetic squeeze"" of his hand, which delights him.

Anna spends the day with Dolly, reconciling her and Stiva by framing his affair as a male weakness, not an ""infidelity of the heart."" Dolly is comforted. Anna encourages Stiva to seek out Dolly. Anna tells Kitty that Vronsky's mother has praised him as a ""hero."" She avoids discussing Vronsky's 200-rouble donation at the station. Anna facilitates Dolly and Stiva's reconciliation. Anna sees Vronsky in the Oblonskys' hall, feeling ""pleasure and dread."" He refuses to come upstairs. Kitty blushes, believing Vronsky came to see her.

At the ball, Kitty observes Anna and Vronsky's clear attraction. Anna intentionally ignores Vronsky's bow. Kitty realizes Vronsky loves Anna, and her own ""unhappiness is complete."" Anna leaves the ball, confirming her departure for Petersburg.

Levin visits his gravely ill brother Nikolay in Moscow, who is living with Marya Nikolaevna. Nikolay, emaciated, expresses his bitterness and his interest in a locksmiths' association. Levin is distraught by Nikolay's condition and cynical views. Nikolay is irritable and accuses Levin of hypocrisy, then drinks heavily. Konstantin, with Marya Nikolaevna's help, gets Nikolay to bed.

Levin returns to his country estate, feeling a sense of clarity and peace. He resolves to live a purer, more disciplined life, working harder. He finds joy in the birth of a calf. He is still pained by Kitty's rejection. He now sees his farming system as a ""cruel and stubborn struggle"" with his laborers and resolves to reform it.

Alexey Alexandrovitch, after Anna's public display of emotion at the races, confronts her. Anna confesses her love for Vronsky and her hatred for Alexey Alexandrovitch. He is shocked and demands she maintain external propriety. Vronsky attempts suicide, shooting himself but only wounding himself. He is nursed by his sister-in-law, Varya.

Alexey Alexandrovitch struggles with Anna's confession. He feels betrayed and humiliated. He decides to pursue a divorce and take Seryozha. He consults a lawyer, who outlines the options, including ""adultery by mutual consent."" Alexey Alexandrovitch, due to religious scruples and a desire to avoid public shame, rejects this and opts for ""undesigned detection"" supported by letters. He finds Anna's portrait ""insolent.""

Kitty falls ill and goes abroad with her mother. She is drawn to Varenka, a selfless, compassionate woman. Kitty is disillusioned by her father's cynicism about Madame Stahl's piety. Kitty, realizing her ""philanthropic"" efforts were a ""sham,"" decides to return to Russia.

He finds joy in farm work, eventually realizing his love for Kitty is paramount, not a simple peasant life. He is distraught by Nikolay's severe illness and cynical views. Alexey Alexandrovitch's letter demands Anna return home and cease contact with Vronsky. Anna is enraged, feeling trapped, and contemplates suicide. She leaves for Betsy's.

Anna meets Vronsky in the Vrede garden. She confesses she told Alexey Alexandrovitch everything. Vronsky, thinking of a duel, is rigid, but then expresses joy, believing this forces a resolution.

Crime and Punishment-Fyodor Dostoyevsky,"This detailed summary is based *solely* on the provided text, without external knowledge of the book.

**Part I**

**Chapter I**
The story begins on a hot July evening with a young man, Raskolnikov, leaving his cramped garret in S. Place. He is deeply in debt to his landlady, who lives on the floor below, and he avoids meeting her due to fear and shame. Raskolnikov is described as handsome but poorly dressed, in an irritable, hypochondriac-like state, isolated and absorbed in his own thoughts. He is burdened by poverty but also by a ""hideous but daring recklessness"" – a ""plan"" he contemplates.

As he walks towards K. bridge in Petersburg, the oppressive heat and city stench exacerbate his overwrought nerves. He mutters to himself, acknowledging his confused ideas and physical weakness from lack of food. A drunken man in a passing wagon shouts at him, calling him ""German hatter,"" which makes Raskolnikov realize his worn-out, noticeable hat could spoil his ""whole plan."" He has counted the 730 steps from his lodging to a particular house. He is on a ""rehearsal"" of his project, his excitement growing.

He approaches a large house by the canal, inhabited by various working people. He is glad to avoid the door-keepers and slips up a dark, narrow back staircase to the fourth storey. Porters are moving furniture from a German clerk's flat, meaning only the old woman will be on that floor. He rings the old woman's bell, which has a peculiar tinkle that reminds him of something. The door opens a tiny crack, revealing the old woman's suspicious eyes. Seeing others on the landing, she opens the door wider.

The old woman is Alyona Ivanovna, a diminutive, withered woman of sixty with sharp, malignant eyes. Raskolnikov identifies himself as a student who visited a month ago. He has returned ""on the same errand,"" which disconcerts him. He enters her small, clean room, noting the yellow wallpaper, geraniums, and old yellow furniture. He observes a cotton curtain leading to another tiny room where the old woman's bed and chest of drawers are.

Alyona Ivanovna asks what he wants, and he offers an old silver watch to pawn. She reminds him his last pledge is overdue. He promises interest for another month, but she states her right to sell his pledge. He asks for four roubles for the watch, which was his father's, promising to redeem it. She offers a rouble and a half, plus interest in advance. He is angered but accepts, remembering he has nowhere else to go and ""another object"" in coming.

While she fumbles for keys and goes behind the curtain to unlock a chest, Raskolnikov mentally notes she keeps keys in her right pocket, on a steel ring, with one large, deeply notched key that must be for a strong-box. He feels the situation is ""degrading."" Alyona Ivanovna returns, calculates the interest owed and due, and gives him one rouble and fifteen copecks for the watch. He does not dispute it. Before leaving, he casually asks if her sister, Lizaveta, is always alone. Alyona Ivanovna responds defensively.

Raskolnikov leaves in extreme confusion, feeling ""loathsome."" He wonders how such an ""atrocious thing"" could come into his head and feels disgust for his own heart. He walks like a drunk man, bumping into passers-by, until he finds himself near a tavern. He has never been in one before but feels a sudden thirst and weakness from lack of food. He orders beer, feels better after drinking, and his thoughts clear. He dismisses his fears as ""physical derangement."" He then notices other patrons, including a man who looks like a retired clerk, staring persistently at him.

**Chapter II**
Raskolnikov, usually a loner, now desires company due to a ""new"" feeling within him. He rests in the tavern, observing the proprietor and a boy at the counter. The clerk, Marmeladov, is over fifty, bald, grizzled, and stout, with a face bloated and greenish from drink. He wears ragged clothes but maintains a semblance of respectability. He addresses Raskolnikov, sensing he is educated. Marmeladov introduces himself as a titular counsellor and asks if Raskolnikov was in service.

Raskolnikov, surprised, says he is studying. Marmeladov, already drunk but speaking fluently, moves to sit with Raskolnikov. He declares poverty is not a vice, but beggary is, and that he is a beggar. He mentions Mr. Lebeziatnikov beat his wife a month ago and asks if Raskolnikov has ever ""petitioned hopelessly for a loan."" Raskolnikov admits he has. Marmeladov explains that one goes to ask for money even knowing it's hopeless because ""every man must have somewhere to go.""

He confesses his daughter first ""went out with a yellow ticket"" (a reference to prostitution) because of their dire poverty. The tavern boys laugh, but Marmeladov accepts it. He calls himself a ""pig"" but his wife, Katerina Ivanovna, a lady of education and an officer's daughter. He laments that she doesn't ""feel for him"" but acknowledges her magnanimity and injustice. He admits she pulls his hair, but he sees it as pity. He sold her stockings and mohair shawl for drink, even though she has consumption and they have three small children. Katerina Ivanovna works tirelessly but is proud and won't tolerate disrespect, which led to her being beaten by Mr. Lebeziatnikov.

Marmeladov continues, recounting Katerina Ivanovna's past as a widow of an infantry officer, left with three children in poverty. He, a widower with his own daughter, Sonia, offered his hand out of compassion. Katerina Ivanovna married him, weeping. For a year he was sober, but lost his job through no fault of his own, and then returned to drink. They now live in a part of a room at Amalia Fyodorovna Lippevechsel's, in dirt and disorder. His daughter, Sonia, had little education. When the children were hungry, Katerina Ivanovna taunted Sonia into prostitution, suggesting ""Darya Frantsovna,"" a woman of ""evil character,"" could help. Sonia silently laid thirty roubles on the table and then covered her face with a shawl and lay on the bed, shuddering. Katerina Ivanovna later knelt and kissed Sonia's feet.

Sonia was forced to take a ""yellow ticket"" and could no longer live with them due to the landlady and Mr. Lebeziatnikov. She now lives with tailors, the Kapernaumovs, and mostly visits her family after dark, giving them what she can. Five weeks ago, Marmeladov got his job back, and his family rejoiced, treating him with reverence. He brought home his first earnings, twenty-three roubles forty copecks, and Katerina Ivanovna called him her ""poppet."" But exactly five days ago, he stole the key to Katerina Ivanovna's box, took the remaining money, and has been drunk and away from home since. He spent Sonia's last thirty copecks on the quart of drink he is now finishing. He asks Raskolnikov if he pities him.

When the innkeeper asks why he should be pitied, Marmeladov dramatically declares he should be ""crucified,"" not pitied, for seeking ""tears and tribulation"" in drink. He speaks of God's mercy forgiving Sonia and all, drunkards and children of shame. He then asks Raskolnikov to accompany him home to Katerina Ivanovna, fearing her eyes and the children's crying more than blows.

They reach Kozel's house and go to the fourth storey. Katerina Ivanovna is thin, emaciated, with magnificent hair and a hectic flush on her cheeks, pacing her disordered room. The youngest child sleeps on the floor; an older boy cries, having been beaten; a nine-year-old girl, Polenka, comforts him. Katerina Ivanovna, unaware of their entry, screams when she sees Marmeladov on his knees in the doorway. She searches him for money, finds none, and drags him into the room by his hair, calling him a ""criminal"" and ""monster."" Marmeladov calls it a ""consolation."" The children cry. Katerina Ivanovna blames Raskolnikov, thinking he drank with her husband, and orders him away. As Raskolnikov leaves, he secretly places some coppers (his change from the tavern) on the window-sill. On the stairs, he regrets it, thinking ""they have Sonia and I want it myself,"" but dismisses it. He reflects that Sonia's ""smartness costs money"" and that ""man grows used to everything."" He then questions if man is truly a scoundrel, or if all is ""prejudice, simply artificial terrors.""

**Chapter III**
Raskolnikov wakes late, bilious and irritable. He hates his tiny, cupboard-like room. His landlady stopped sending him meals two weeks ago. Nastasya, the cook, brings him tea and cabbage soup. She tells him the landlady, Praskovya Pavlovna, plans to complain to the police about his unpaid rent. Raskolnikov dismisses it, plans to talk to her, and admits he's doing nothing now, just ""thinking."" Nastasya laughs. He mentions needing boots to give lessons and wanting ""a fortune."" Nastasya then tells him a letter arrived for him yesterday.

The letter is from his mother, Pulcheria Raskolnikov. He feels a sudden pang and wants to be alone to read it. The letter details her distress at his giving up university. She mentions sending him fifteen roubles four months ago, borrowed from Vassily Ivanovitch Vahrushin against her pension. Now, her financial situation has improved, and she can send more. His sister Dounia has been living with her for six weeks, and her ""sufferings are over.""

The letter explains Dounia's difficult time as a governess with the Svidrigaïlovs. Mr. Svidrigaïlov initially treated her rudely, but later developed a ""passion"" for her and made an ""open and shameful proposal,"" offering inducements and to take her abroad. Dounia couldn't leave due to a debt to the family (sixty roubles she took to send to Raskolnikov) and to spare Marfa Petrovna, Svidrigaïlov's wife. Marfa Petrovna overheard her husband, misunderstood the situation, and publicly slandered Dounia, sending her home in a peasant's cart. The town gossiped, and acquaintances avoided them.

However, Mr. Svidrigaïlov repented and provided Marfa Petrovna with ""complete and unmistakable proof of Dounia’s innocence,"" a letter Dounia had written refusing his advances and reproaching him. Servants' testimony also cleared Dounia. Marfa Petrovna was convinced, begged Dounia's forgiveness, and spent days circulating the letter and asserting Dounia's innocence, restoring her reputation.

Now, Dounia has a suitor, Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin, a counsellor and distant relation of Marfa Petrovna. He is well-to-do, has two government posts, and has made his fortune. He is forty-five, prepossessing, but seems morose and conceited. Dounia has consented to marry him, not out of love, but because he is a ""practical man"" who shares ""many of the convictions ‘of our most rising generation’"" and is an ""opponent of all prejudices."" Pulcheria Alexandrovna believes Dounia will make him happy and that he will care for her. Luzhin expressed that he sought a poor girl without a dowry who had experienced poverty, so his wife would view him as her benefactor. Pulcheria Alexandrovna found this rude, but Dounia dismissed it, saying ""words are not deeds."" Dounia walked all night, praying before deciding.

Luzhin is going to Petersburg to open a legal bureau and will be a great help to Raskolnikov's career. Dounia plans for Raskolnikov to become his associate, even partner. They hope Luzhin will pay for Raskolnikov's university studies, not as charity, but as earned salary. Pulcheria Alexandrovna mentions not wanting to live with them after the wedding, preferring independence near Raskolnikov. She is sending him twenty-five or thirty roubles from a loan against her pension, and she and Dounia are coming to Petersburg very soon, perhaps in a week. She expresses her love for her children and asks if Raskolnikov still prays.

Raskolnikov is deeply affected, his face wet with tears, then pale and distorted with a ""bitter, wrathful and malignant smile."" He feels suffocated in his room and goes out, forgetting his dread. He walks towards Vassilyevsky Ostrov, muttering to himself.

**Chapter IV**
Raskolnikov's mother's letter is a ""torture."" He resolves ""Never such a marriage while I am alive and Mr. Luzhin be damned!"" He sees Dounia's sacrifice as being for his sake, to secure his future. He rejects this sacrifice, stating, ""I won’t have your sacrifice, Dounia, I won’t have it, mother! It shall not be, so long as I am alive, it shall not, it shall not! I won’t accept it!""

He then questions how he can prevent it, as he has nothing to offer them. He reflects on Marmeladov's question, ""Do you understand, sir, what it means when you have absolutely nowhere to turn?"" This brings back a thought he had yesterday, which now appears as a ""new menacing and quite unfamiliar shape.""

He walks to K---- Boulevard, looking for a seat. He notices a young, drunk girl, disheveled and with her dress torn, staggering in the street. Another gentleman, a plump dandy, is clearly waiting to accost her. Raskolnikov, furious, confronts the gentleman, calling him ""Svidrigaïlov"" (a name he uses in anger, not necessarily the actual person). A policeman intervenes. Raskolnikov explains the girl's state and the gentleman's intentions, giving the policeman twenty copecks to get her a cab and take her home. The policeman, showing compassion, tries to get her address. The girl mutters, ""Go away! They won’t let me alone,"" and staggers off, followed by the dandy. The policeman follows, sighing about the vice in the world.

Raskolnikov has a sudden ""revulsion of feeling."" He calls after the policeman to ""Let them be! What is it to do with you? Let her go! Let him amuse himself."" He then curses himself for interfering, questioning his right to help and his twenty copecks. He feels wretched, wanting to forget everything. He reflects on the girl's likely tragic future, then thinks, ""But what if Dounia were one of the percentage!""

He suddenly remembers he was going to see Razumihin on Vassilyevsky Ostrov. Razumihin is an old university comrade, a good-humored, intelligent, and resilient young man who supports himself through various work. Raskolnikov has avoided him for months.

**Chapter V**
Raskolnikov considers asking Razumihin for work but dismisses it as not what he truly wants. He has a ""fantastic thought"": he will go to Razumihin ""on the next day after It, when It will be over and everything will begin afresh."" He realizes this implies his ""plan"" will actually happen. He jumps up, filled with loathing for his room where ""all _this_ had for a month past been growing up in him."" He walks aimlessly, feeling cold and feverish.

He crosses Vassilyevsky Ostrov and the Lesser Neva bridge, walking towards the islands. The natural beauty temporarily calms him, but soon turns to morbid irritability. He counts his money: thirty copecks. He realizes he gave twenty to the policeman and three to Nastasya, meaning he must have given forty-seven or fifty to the Marmeladovs yesterday. He drinks vodka and eats a pie. The vodka makes him drowsy, and he falls asleep in the bushes in Petrovsky Ostrov.

He has a ""fearful dream."" He is seven years old, walking with his father to the graveyard in his hometown. They pass a tavern, a place he fears, filled with drunken, shouting people. Near the tavern, a thin, sorrel mare is hitched to a large cart, usually drawn by heavy horses. A peasant named Mikolka, drunk, shouts that he will take everyone in the cart, even if he has to beat the mare to death. Other drunken peasants join him. Raskolnikov, as a child, is horrified and cries out for his father to intervene as Mikolka and others brutally whip the mare. The mare struggles, kicks, and is eventually beaten to death with a shaft and then an iron crowbar. The child Raskolnikov, beside himself, rushes to the dead mare, embraces its bleeding head, and then tries to attack Mikolka. His father pulls him away.

Raskolnikov wakes up, gasping and sweating, relieved it was a dream. He feels utterly broken. He questions if he will truly take an axe and shed blood. He believes he couldn't do it, recalling his revulsion after his ""experiment"" (his previous visit to Alyona Ivanovna). He feels a sudden sense of relief, as if a ""fearful burden"" has been lifted. He renounces his ""accursed... dream.""

He crosses the bridge, feeling calm. On his way home, he inexplicably turns towards the Hay Market, a place he usually avoids. There, he overhears a huckster and his wife talking to Lizaveta Ivanovna, Alyona Ivanovna's sister. They invite Lizaveta to come to their place ""to-morrow about seven"" because ""they will be here too."" Lizaveta is slow to decide but agrees. Raskolnikov realizes Lizaveta, the old woman's only companion, will be away tomorrow at seven, leaving Alyona Ivanovna alone. This fact feels like a ""predestined turning-point of his fate."" He feels everything is ""irrevocably decided.""

**Chapter VI**
Raskolnikov later learns the huckster and his wife invited Lizaveta to help sell some family goods. He reflects on his recent superstition and past coincidences: a student he knew gave him Alyona Ivanovna's address, and later he overheard a student and officer discussing the pawnbroker and her sister, even suggesting killing her for her money. This trivial tavern talk had a profound influence on him.

Returning from the Hay Market, Raskolnikov lies on his sofa in a feverish sleep. He wakes late the next morning. Nastasya has difficulty rousing him. He discovers thick drops of congealed blood on his trousers, which he cuts off. He realizes he still has the purse and trinkets from the old woman's box in his pockets and frantically hides them in a hole under the wallpaper. He fears his reason is deserting him. He remembers he had forgotten to remove the axe's loop from his coat and quickly cuts it off, hiding the pieces. He worries about the frayed rags from his trousers lying on the floor and the blood on his sock, which he also hides.

A loud knocking at his door wakes him again. Nastasya and the house porter are there. The porter gives him a summons to the police office for that day at half-past nine. Raskolnikov is terrified, thinking ""All's discovered."" He is called for a debt, a writ for 115 roubles owed to his landlady, the widow of assessor Zarnitsyn, which she sold to Mr. Tchebarov. He claims he has no debt to anyone. He had promised to marry her daughter, Natalya Yegorovna, who then died of typhus. He explains the IOU was given as a gesture of trust, not a real demand, and his landlady would never use it unless he could pay.

The assistant superintendent, Ilya Petrovitch, is angry at Raskolnikov's late arrival and his defiant attitude. He accuses Raskolnikov of impudence for smoking in a government office. Raskolnikov retorts, feeling ""indescribable satisfaction."" Luzhin's complaint is read. Raskolnikov feels immense relief that the summons is not about the murder, but about a debt.

Ilya Petrovitch then violently scolds a smartly dressed, purple-faced lady, Luise Ivanovna, for fighting and drinking at her house the previous night. She defends herself, saying a man broke her piano, hit people, and squealed like a pig from her window. She paid him five roubles for his coat. Ilya Petrovitch contemptuously lumps authors, literary men, students, and town-criers together as unruly.

Nikodim Fomitch, the superintendent, arrives, calming Ilya Petrovitch. Raskolnikov, seeking to appear reasonable, explains his poverty and the history of the IOU. Ilya Petrovitch rudely dismisses his ""affecting details."" As the head clerk dictates a formal declaration, Raskolnikov feels an ""agonising, everlasting solitude."" He signs the paper.

He has a sudden impulse to confess everything to Nikodim Fomitch. But then he overhears Nikodim Fomitch and Ilya Petrovitch discussing the murder of the pawnbroker. They say the door was locked, then found open, leading to suspicion against Koch and Pestryakov. However, Koch was at the silversmith's, and Pestryakov was seen with friends entering the house. The murderer must have been there and slipped away. Koch believes the murderer hid in the empty flat. No one saw the murderer.

Raskolnikov picks up his hat to leave, but faints. When he recovers, he finds himself sitting in a chair, attended to. Nikodim Fomitch asks if he has been ill long. Raskolnikov says ""Since yesterday"" and admits he went out at ""About seven."" Ilya Petrovitch asks where he went, and Raskolnikov replies, ""Along the street."" He is ""white as a handkerchief."" Ilya Petrovitch concludes, ""we will not detain you."" Raskolnikov leaves, hearing them continue to discuss him, believing they suspect him.

**Part II**

**Chapter II**
Raskolnikov rushes home, fearing a search. He finds his room untouched. He quickly retrieves the hidden items from the wall: eight articles including two small boxes with earrings, four leather cases, a chain, and a decoration. He puts them in his pockets and leaves his door open. He feels shattered but determined to hide the evidence. His initial plan was to throw them in the canal, but he finds it too public. He then considers the Neva River or the Islands.

He walks towards the Neva, but then spots a deserted courtyard leading between blank walls. At the back, a stone shed. He finds a large unhewn stone and with great effort, overturns it, revealing a hollow underneath. He empties his pockets into it, including the purse. He replaces the stone, scraping earth around it to conceal it. A moment of intense joy overwhelms him; he laughs nervously, feeling his tracks are buried.

Crossing K---- Boulevard, his laughter stops. He feels loathsome to pass the seat where he had pondered the girl's fate. He is furious at himself for his ""stupid"" actions and the lies he told at the police office. A new question torments him: if his crime was deliberate, why didn't he even look in the purse? He attributes his erratic behavior to illness. He longs for distraction, but feels an ""immeasurable, almost physical, repulsion for everything surrounding him.""

He arrives at Razumihin's lodging. Razumihin, unkempt but good-natured, is surprised to see him and immediately notes Raskolnikov's illness. Raskolnikov, feeling a ""spleen"" rise within him, abruptly tries to leave. Razumihin stops him, offering work translating a German text titled ""Is woman a human being?"" for three roubles. Raskolnikov takes the papers and money, leaves, but then returns them, still without a word, muttering ""I don’t want... translation."" Razumihin is enraged.

On Nikolaevsky Bridge, Raskolnikov is lashed by a coachman for almost falling under his horses. An elderly woman gives him twenty copecks, mistaking him for a beggar. He stares at the Neva, recalling past visits to this spot when he felt a ""vague and mysterious emotion."" He feels detached from his past self. He flings the twenty copecks into the water, feeling he has ""cut himself off from everyone and from everything.""

He returns home after six hours of walking, exhausted, and falls into oblivion. He is awakened by a fearful scream: his landlady is being beaten on the stairs by Ilya Petrovitch. He is terrified, thinking it's about yesterday's events. The noise subsides. Nastasya brings him soup. He asks her why the landlady was beaten. Nastasya, after scrutinizing him intently, says ""It’s the blood"" and then firmly denies anyone was beating the landlady, saying ""That’s the blood crying in your ears."" Raskolnikov, growing pale, mutters, ""Blood? What blood?"" He asks for water and loses consciousness after one sip.

**Chapter III**
Raskolnikov is sick for days, sometimes delirious. He remembers people around him, a man he knows but can't place, and Nastasya. He feels he has forgotten something important. At last, he regains full consciousness.

It is ten in the morning. Nastasya and a messenger are in his room, the landlady peeking in. Razumihin bursts in, having learned of Raskolnikov's illness from the landlady, Pashenka. He tells Raskolnikov he's been ill for four days and he brought Dr. Zossimov twice. The messenger is there to deliver thirty-five roubles from his mother, sent via Afanasy Ivanovitch Vahrushin. Raskolnikov initially refuses the money but signs for it at Razumihin's insistence.

Razumihin, now acting as Raskolnikov's caretaker, feeds him soup and tea, brought by Nastasya. He explains how he found Raskolnikov by going to the address bureau, and how he got to know all his affairs, including meeting Nikodim Fomitch, Ilya Petrovitch, the house-porter, Mr. Zametov (head clerk at the police office), and Pashenka. He tells him he prevented Pashenka from taking legal action over the IOU by guaranteeing payment, getting the IOU back, and tearing it up.

Raskolnikov asks if he said anything in his delirium. Razumihin says he raved about a ""bulldog, and about ear-rings and chains, and about Krestovsky Island, and some porter, and Nikodim Fomitch and Ilya Petrovitch."" He also asked piteously for his sock, which Zametov found for him. Razumihin says he spent six roubles in advance on the German translation for Raskolnikov and will give him three of those roubles. He leaves to inform Zossimov and asks Nastasya to look after Raskolnikov.

Alone, Raskolnikov frantically searches for the hidden items, but they are still in the stove and under the quilt. He wonders if they know. He considers escaping to America but then gulps down beer and falls into a deep, refreshing sleep. He wakes to Razumihin, who has bought him new clothes: a cap, trousers, and boots for nine roubles fifty-five copecks. Raskolnikov listens with disgust but allows Razumihin to change his linen. He asks about the money, and Razumihin says it's from his mother.

**Chapter IV**
Zossimov, a tall, fat, clean-shaven doctor, arrives. He examines Raskolnikov, concluding he is recovering from a nervous condition due to bad feeding. Razumihin plans a walk for Raskolnikov to the Yusupov Garden and Palais de Cristal. Razumihin also mentions his house-warming party tonight, inviting Zossimov and listing other guests: students, a teacher, a clerk, a musician, an officer, and Zametov. Porfiry Petrovitch, head of the Investigation Department, is also invited.

Razumihin criticizes Zossimov's ""principles"" for judging men and defends Zametov, despite his taking bribes. He then mentions the murder of the old pawnbroker, a case he is trying to ""clear up."" Nastasya interjects that Lizaveta was also murdered. Raskolnikov reacts with a barely audible murmur and stares at a flower on the wallpaper, his limbs feeling lifeless.

Razumihin explains the police initially suspected Koch and Pestryakov, but then a painter, Nikolay, was accused. Nikolay brought gold earrings to a dram-shop owner, Dushkin, asking for two roubles, claiming he found them in the street. Dushkin, a receiver of stolen goods, grew suspicious after hearing of the murder and Nikolay's subsequent flight and attempted suicide. Nikolay later confessed he found the box in the passage of the murdered woman's flat.

Raskolnikov suddenly cries out, ""Behind the door? Lying behind the door?"" staring at Razumihin in terror. Razumihin, surprised, confirms. Raskolnikov turns to the wall, and Razumihin and Zossimov attribute it to a dream. Razumihin expresses frustration that the police are convinced Nikolay is the murderer, despite evidence to the contrary (the warm bodies, Nikolay's childish scuffling at the gate immediately after the time of death). Razumihin believes the real murderer dropped the earrings while hiding from Koch and Pestryakov.

At that moment, Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin enters.

**Chapter V**
Luzhin, a portly man, stops in the doorway, staring with undisguised astonishment at Raskolnikov's room and his unkempt state. He then scrutinizes Razumihin. Luzhin introduces himself to Raskolnikov, expecting his name to be known. Raskolnikov, expecting something else, stares blankly. Luzhin mentions sending a letter about his arrival over ten days ago.

Razumihin, rudely but good-naturedly, tells Luzhin to sit down. He explains Raskolnikov has been ill and is recovering. Luzhin describes his fashionable attire, new and almost too appropriate for a fiancé. Raskolnikov smiles ""malignantly.""

Luzhin expresses regret at finding Raskolnikov ill and mentions his important legal case. He says he expects Raskolnikov's mother and sister any minute and has found them lodging nearby in Bakaleyev’s house, in Voskresensky. Razumihin interjects that it's a ""disgusting place--filthy, stinking and... of doubtful character."" Luzhin, huffily, says he couldn't know that, as he's a stranger in Petersburg. He says he's staying with Andrey Semyonovitch Lebeziatnikov at Madame Lippevechsel's and that Lebeziatnikov told him of Bakaleyev's house.

Raskolnikov slowly recognizes the name Lebeziatnikov. Luzhin describes him as a nice, ""advanced"" young man from whom he learns new things. He praises ""our most rising generation"" for their practical views and progress, contrasting them with old dreamy authors. Raskolnikov suddenly pronounces, ""He’s learnt it by heart to show off!""

Luzhin, ignoring Raskolnikov, continues his discourse on economic ideas, arguing that self-love leads to common welfare. Razumihin cuts in, disgusted by the ""chattering to amuse oneself"" and stating that many unscrupulous people have distorted the progressive cause. Luzhin is offended.

Zossimov states that one of the old woman's customers must have killed her. Razumihin agrees, noting Porfiry is examining all who pawned things with her. Raskolnikov asks aloud if they are ""examining them."" Razumihin explains they have names from Koch and the pledge wrappers. Luzhin interjects, noting the increase in crime among both lower and higher classes and the ""demoralisation of the civilised part of our society."" He speculates the pawnbroker was murdered by someone of a ""higher class.""

Raskolnikov, with a voice quivering with fury, asks Luzhin if he told his fiancée, ""within an hour of her acceptance,"" that what pleased him most was that she was a beggar, so he could have ""complete control over her"" and reproach her as his benefactor. Luzhin, crimson with confusion, denies it, blaming Raskolnikov's mother for misrepresenting his words. Raskolnikov, raising himself on his pillow, warns Luzhin that if he ever mentions his mother again, he will ""send you flying downstairs!""

Razumihin is shocked. Raskolnikov demands to be left alone, crying that he is not afraid of anyone. Zossimov takes Razumihin away, noting Raskolnikov has a ""fixed idea weighing on him"" and is interested only in the murder. He promises to return later.

**Chapter VI**
Alone, Raskolnikov dresses in his new clothes, feeling a ""strange sudden calm."" He takes the twenty-five roubles and coppers from the table. He has one thought: ""all _this_ must be ended to-day."" He walks towards the Hay Market, encounters a street singer, and gives her five copecks. He talks strangely to a passerby about liking street music on ""cold, dark, damp autumn evenings."" He asks a young man at the Hay Market about the huckster who spoke to Lizaveta.

He wanders through a street with dram shops and eating houses, filled with women and drunken men. He feels drawn to the noise and singing in a saloon, but then moves on. A prostitute, Duclida, asks him for money for a drink. He gives her fifteen copecks. He has an internal thought about a condemned man who would prefer to live on a small rock for eternity than die immediately. He thinks, ""Man is a vile creature!"" and ""Vile is he who calls him vile for that.""

He goes to a clean restaurant, the Palais de Cristal, and asks for old newspapers. He finds an article about the pawnbroker's murder and reads it eagerly. Zametov, the head clerk, sits beside him, surprised to see him out, having been told he was unconscious. Raskolnikov, with a mocking smile, asks Zametov about his social life and his visit to Luise Ivanovna. He then asks Zametov if he's interested in what he's reading. Raskolnikov, after some taunting, reveals he was searching for news of the pawnbroker's murder, bringing his face ""exceedingly close"" to Zametov's. Zametov is visibly alarmed.

Raskolnikov then talks about the Moscow false coiners, critiquing their lack of cunning. He describes how *he* would pass false notes, with meticulous detail designed to confuse. Zametov comments that even a desperate man's hands would shake. Raskolnikov scoffs, ""Why don't you catch him then?"" He then describes *his* method for hiding the stolen money and jewels under a heavy stone in a deserted yard. Zametov, now pale and twitching, whispers, ""You are a madman."" Raskolnikov, with a terrible word trembling on his lips, suddenly asks, ""And what if it was I who murdered the old woman and Lizaveta?"" Zametov turns ""white as the tablecloth."" Raskolnikov then reveals he has twenty-five roubles and new clothes, implying they are from the crime. He leaves, feeling ""wild hysterical sensation"" and ""insufferable rapture,"" but also gloomy and tired.

As he leaves, he stumbles upon Razumihin, who is furious that Raskolnikov left his bed. Raskolnikov calmly tells him he wants to be alone and doesn't want his benevolence. Razumihin, enraged, calls him a ""madman"" and a ""fool,"" but then invites him to his house-warming party. Raskolnikov refuses. Razumihin, still furious, runs back to the Palais de Cristal to question Zametov.

Raskolnikov walks to X---- Bridge. He feels weaker. He sees a woman throw herself into the canal. People rescue her. He feels indifference and apathy, deciding that drowning himself is ""not good enough."" He determines to go to the police office, but then turns into a side street, delaying. He finds himself at the gate of *the* house, the murder scene. He goes in, up the familiar stairs. The flat is being redecorated, workmen are papering the walls. He sits on the window-sill, annoyed by the changes. He pulls the old bell several times, experiencing again the ""hideous and agonisingly fearful sensation."" He tells the workmen he wants to take a flat and asks if the floors have been painted and if there's any blood. They are uneasy. He tells them to go to the police station, saying he will tell them everything there. Downstairs, he identifies himself to the porter and other bystanders as Rodion Romanovitch Raskolnikov, formerly a student, living nearby. He mockingly asks if they ""funk the police station."" The big porter throws him into the street.

Raskolnikov then sees a crowd and a carriage. On the ground, a man has been run over, covered with blood. He recognizes him as Marmeladov. He shouts his name, pushes through the crowd, and identifies himself, pulling out money and offering to pay for a doctor. He insists Marmeladov be taken to his lodging immediately, not the hospital. He slips money to the policeman.

**Chapter VII**
Marmeladov is carried to his lodging, with Raskolnikov holding his head. Katerina Ivanovna is pacing, coughing, and recounting her past aristocratic life to Polenka. The children are distressed. Katerina Ivanovna is horrified to see her husband brought in, calling him a ""criminal."" Raskolnikov reassures her, saying he was run over and is not killed, and that he will pay. He sends for a doctor. Katerina Ivanovna quickly places a pillow under Marmeladov's head and begins undressing him. She brings a basin of water to wash his blood-stained face.

The room fills with lodgers. Katerina Ivanovna shouts at them, then confronts Amalia Ivanovna, who runs in. Katerina Ivanovna proudly asserts her family's former status and points to Raskolnikov, calling him a ""generous young man... who has wealth and connections."" Marmeladov regains consciousness, asks for a priest. Katerina Ivanovna, overcome with despair, laments her ""cursed life."" The doctor arrives, examines Marmeladov, and whispers to Raskolnikov that he will die immediately. The priest administers the sacrament. Polenka arrives, announcing Sonia is coming.

Sonia enters, dressed in cheap, gaudy finery, looking bewildered and frightened. She stops in the doorway, staring at the bed. Marmeladov, seeing her, cries out, ""Sonia! Daughter! Forgive!"" and tries to reach her, falling off the sofa. He dies in her arms. Katerina Ivanovna cries, ""He’s got what he wanted! ... What’s to be done now? How am I to bury him! What can I give them to-morrow to eat?""

Raskolnikov gives Katerina Ivanovna twenty roubles, saying it's to repay a debt to his dead friend, and promises to return. He leaves, encountering Nikodim Fomitch, who notices blood on Raskolnikov's waistcoat. Raskolnikov, with a peculiar air, says he is ""covered with blood"" and smiles.

He walks away, feeling a new sensation of ""life and strength,"" like a man pardoned from death. He overhears Polenka running after him, asking his name and address for Sonia. He gives it, and Polenka kisses him, weeping for her father. Raskolnikov feels comforted, thinking, ""Life is real!"" He now decides to go to Razumihin's. He arrives at Razumihin’s house-warming, sees his mother and sister already there, and faints from the shock of seeing them. Razumihin catches him, reassures the women, and puts Raskolnikov on the sofa.

**Part III**

**Chapter I**
Raskolnikov sits up, weakly dismisses Razumihin's consolations, and for a moment gazes at his mother and sister. He tells them to go home with Razumihin, wanting to be left alone. Pulcheria Alexandrovna insists on staying, but Raskolnikov irritably says he ""can't stand it!"" Dounia, understanding, urges her mother to leave.

Raskolnikov then asks if they've seen Luzhin. He tells Dounia he doesn't want the marriage and that she must refuse Luzhin tomorrow. Pulcheria Alexandrovna is horrified. Dounia gently suggests he's too tired to talk. Raskolnikov insists he is not delirious and that Dounia is marrying Luzhin for his sake, a sacrifice he won't accept. He tells her to write a refusal letter by tomorrow. Dounia is offended. Razumihin, tipsy, confirms Raskolnikov drove Luzhin away today.

Pulcheria Alexandrovna, in despair, whispers to Razumihin that she won't leave Raskolnikov. Razumihin persuades her to go with Dounia, promising Nastasya will stay with Raskolnikov and he will bring Zossimov back later with a report. He also warns them that their lodging is unsuitable. Avdotya Romanovna (Dounia) agrees to go. Razumihin, in his drunken infatuation, praises Dounia profusely and falls to his knees to kiss her hands. He reveals he thinks Luzhin is a ""scoundrel"" and a ""spy.""

Pulcheria Alexandrovna and Dounia return to their lodging, still anxious. Dounia tells her mother that Razumihin has saved Rodya and they can depend on him. She reassures her mother that Raskolnikov's sullenness is due to his illness.

**Chapter II**
Razumihin wakes up troubled, ashamed of his drunken behavior the previous night, especially his insults towards Luzhin and his ""dream"" of Avdotya Romanovna. He carefully dresses and washes. He reflects on his ""coarse and envious heart.""

Zossimov, who stayed overnight, comes in. Razumihin tells him Raskolnikov is still asleep and then reveals he told the ladies that Zossimov thought Raskolnikov might be insane. Zossimov is annoyed, explaining Raskolnikov's condition is monomania, exacerbated by his poverty, vanity, and the suspicion cast on him at the police station (which Zametov's story partly cleared up). Razumihin then leaves to find the ladies.

At Bakaleyev’s, Pulcheria Alexandrovna and Dounia eagerly await Razumihin. He enters, feeling awkward, but is met with gratitude and respect, especially from Dounia. He tells them Raskolnikov is well. Pulcheria Alexandrovna reveals she received a letter from Luzhin that morning, asking them to read it. He promised to meet them at the station but sent a servant instead, then wrote that he would visit them at 8 pm that evening, but *demanded* that Raskolnikov not be present due to his ""gross and unprecedented affront"" yesterday. He also requires an ""explanation"" from Pulcheria Alexandrovna and accuses Raskolnikov of giving money to Sonia, ""a young woman of notorious behaviour,"" on the pretext of her father's funeral.

Pulcheria Alexandrovna asks Razumihin what to do, as Raskolnikov insisted on refusing Luzhin. Razumihin advises following Dounia's decision. Dounia decides Raskolnikov *must* be present at the interview and asks Razumihin to come too. Pulcheria Alexandrovna agrees, preferring truth to concealment.

**Chapter III**
The door opens and Sonia Marmeladov enters, looking timid and overwhelmed. Raskolnikov, surprised, remembers Luzhin's calumny about her but feels pity for her. He seats her. He introduces Sonia to his mother and sister as Marmeladov's daughter. Pulcheria Alexandrovna eyes Sonia suspiciously, while Dounia scrutinizes her.

Sonia, faltering, delivers Katerina Ivanovna’s invitation to Marmeladov's memorial service and funeral lunch tomorrow. Raskolnikov confirms the funeral lunch and asks about the police's involvement. Sonia says they were not worried, but the lodgers were angry about the body remaining so long. It will be moved to the cemetery chapel today.

Raskolnikov notes Sonia's thin, pale, childish appearance. He asks if Katerina Ivanovna can afford the lunch. Sonia explains it will be plain, and they've calculated it. She then blurts out that Raskolnikov ""gave us everything yesterday,"" referring to his money. Pulcheria Alexandrovna and Dounia look kindly at Sonia.

Pulcheria Alexandrovna suggests Rodya take a walk, then dine with them. Raskolnikov agrees to dine but says he has ""something to see to."" Dounia, following her mother out, gives Sonia a courteous bow, which Sonia finds painful. Raskolnikov calls Dounia back to shake her hand again, squeezing her fingers warmly. He tells Sonia, ""God give peace to the dead, the living have still to live.""

Pulcheria Alexandrovna and Dounia discuss Raskolnikov. Pulcheria Alexandrovna worries about Luzhin breaking off the engagement; Dounia dismisses him contemptuously. Pulcheria Alexandrovna mentions a dream of Marfa Petrovna and reveals Marfa Petrovna's sudden death. She believes Svidrigaïlov caused it by beating her. Dounia, however, implies he might not be so bad, saying he was patient with Marfa for seven years.

Raskolnikov returns to the conversation, irritated by their gossip. Dounia states that their mother was ""crossing herself with terror"" coming up the stairs. Raskolnikov is confused and pale, then abruptly asks why they are all so dull. Zossimov leaves. Raskolnikov comments on Dounia’s beautiful watch, which she says was a gift from Marfa Petrovna, not Luzhin. He remembers his past love for his landlady's daughter, now dead, who was sickly and wanted to be a nun. He then kisses his mother. He feels distant from them, as if ""looking at you from a thousand miles away.""

He reiterates his demand that Dounia refuse Luzhin: ""It is me or Luzhin."" Dounia explains she is marrying for her own sake, choosing ""the less"" of two evils, and will perform her duties honestly. Raskolnikov accuses her of lying, saying she cannot respect Luzhin and is ""selling herself for money."" Dounia retorts that he is merciless, not committing murder, and questions why he looks at her so pale. Raskolnikov, after a brief faint, asks how she will get proof of respect from Luzhin today. Dounia tells her mother to show him Luzhin's letter.

Reading the letter, Raskolnikov comments on Luzhin's uneducated writing for a lawyer, though Razumihin defends it as ""legal jargon."" Raskolnikov points out Luzhin's explicit threat to leave if Raskolnikov is present, and his slander about Raskolnikov giving money to Sonia, implying Sonia is a woman ""of notorious behaviour."" He clarifies he gave the money to Katerina Ivanovna for the funeral, not to Sonia, whom he saw for the first time last night. He argues Luzhin intends to slander him and create dissension in his family. Dounia agrees, stating Luzhin is a ""contemptible slanderer."" She insists Raskolnikov be present at the interview, and Razumihin too. Pulcheria Alexandrovna agrees.

**Chapter IV**
Sonia re-enters. Raskolnikov is astonished, remembering Luzhin's accusations about her ""notorious behaviour."" He feels pity for her and asks her to sit. He reintroduces her to his mother, emphasizing she is Marmeladov's daughter. Sonia, embarrassed, explains Katerina Ivanovna's funeral arrangements and thanks Raskolnikov for his help. Raskolnikov continues to question her, noting her thinness and small size. He is surprised Katerina Ivanovna plans a funeral lunch. Sonia mentions his poor room. She then thanks him again for giving them money yesterday. Pulcheria Alexandrovna and Dounia leave to prepare for dinner, inviting Razumihin. Dounia gives Sonia a courteous bow. Raskolnikov calls Dounia back to squeeze her hand, smiling. He then tells Sonia, ""God give peace to the dead, the living have still to live."" He asks Sonia where she lives and says he will visit her today. Sonia, confused and embarrassed, gives her address and leaves, not noticing a gentleman following her.

The gentleman is about fifty, well-dressed, with a broad, pleasant face, flaxen hair, and blue eyes. He follows Sonia to her lodging at Kapernaumov the tailor's. He rings the bell next door and says he is a neighbor, lodging at Madame Resslich’s.

Razumihin, on the way to Porfiry's with Raskolnikov, is excited. Raskolnikov admits he pawned his ring and father's watch with the old woman. He emphasizes his delirium when he mentioned ""rings or chains"" to Razumihin. Raskolnikov asks if Porfiry knows he was at the old woman's flat. Razumihin assures him Porfiry is a clever man but given to teasing and not one to be afraid of. Raskolnikov continues to make fun of Razumihin's excitement about Dounia. They enter Porfiry's flat.

**Chapter V**
Raskolnikov enters Porfiry Petrovitch’s study with feigned mirth. Razumihin, embarrassed by upsetting a table, stands by the window. Porfiry, a short, corpulent man of thirty-five, wearing a dressing-gown, greets Raskolnikov. Zametov is also present. Raskolnikov presents his paper about the pawned watch. Porfiry confirms it's all right and says he has been ""expecting"" Raskolnikov. Razumihin is surprised, but Porfiry explains Raskolnikov's name was on the pledge wrapper and he's the only one not to have come forward. Raskolnikov, growing angry, asserts he was ill.

Raskolnikov, increasingly irritated, challenges Porfiry about his ""legal rule"" of beginning examinations with irrelevant subjects to disarm suspects. Porfiry, amused, confirms this, winks at Raskolnikov, and laughs. Raskolnikov, seeing through this, becomes furious and demands to know if Porfiry suspects him. Porfiry tries to calm him, reiterating his geniality and offering him a cigarette. He speaks ramblingly about official duties and the ""free art"" of investigation, while Raskolnikov notices him listening at the door, suggesting he expects someone.

Porfiry continues, explaining that he doesn't immediately arrest a suspect, even with evidence, to allow them to ""walk about the town a bit"" and ""lose his head,"" eventually confessing on his own. He compares it to a butterfly circling a candle. Raskolnikov, growing colder, realizes Porfiry is trying to scare him.

Porfiry then mentions Raskolnikov's article ""On Crime,"" which suggested ""extraordinary"" men have the right to transgress law and commit crimes for a greater good. Raskolnikov, though irritated, affirms his theory: that certain individuals (legislators, leaders like Napoleon) have an ""inner right"" to ""overstep... certain obstacles"" if it's essential for their idea, even if it means ""wading through blood."" He clarifies that ""ordinary"" people are conservative and obedient, while ""extraordinary"" people are ""destroyers"" who move the world forward. He confirms he believes in ""the New Jerusalem"" and in God, and in Lazarus's rising from the dead.

Porfiry playfully questions how to distinguish these ""extraordinary"" people and if there are many of them. Raskolnikov explains the rarity of truly new people, stating that the ""vast mass of mankind is mere material."" Razumihin, finally exasperated, cries out, ""You are right, of course, in saying that it’s not new... but what is really original in all this... is that you sanction bloodshed _in the name of conscience_."" Porfiry agrees it is ""more terrible.""

Porfiry continues to provoke Raskolnikov, asking if he, as an ""extraordinary man,"" could ""rob and murder."" Raskolnikov replies he wouldn't tell him if he did. Zametov interjects, suggesting a ""future Napoleon"" might have killed Alyona Ivanovna. A gloomy silence follows. As Raskolnikov prepares to leave, Porfiry, with excessive politeness, asks him to visit again ""to-morrow"" to arrange the redemption of his pledges, adding that as ""one of the last to be _there_,"" he might tell them something. Raskolnikov sharply asks if he means to cross-examine him officially. Porfiry denies it, but then, ""suddenly delighted,"" mentions Razumihin talking about Nikolay and clarifies that Nikolay is innocent. He then asks Raskolnikov if he saw two painters working in an open flat on the second storey when he went upstairs between seven and eight on the day of the murder. Raskolnikov, recognizing the trap, denies seeing them, but then ""triumphantly"" remembers porters moving furniture on the fourth storey (his previous visit) but still denies seeing painters or an open flat. Razumihin, realizing Porfiry's error, points out that the painters were working on the day of the murder, not three days before (when Raskolnikov previously visited). Porfiry slaps his forehead, admitting he ""muddled it."" They depart.

**Chapter VI**
Razumihin, confused, tries to refute Raskolnikov's arguments about Porfiry's intentions. Raskolnikov, with a cold smile, insists Porfiry had no facts, only ""mirage"" and ""supposition,"" and was trying to provoke him. Razumihin agrees it's insulting and offers to confront Porfiry or Zametov. Razumihin then has a sudden realization: if Raskolnikov *had* done the deed, he would have claimed to see the workmen to appear innocent. Raskolnikov admits this, explaining that experienced criminals admit unavoidable facts but provide alternate explanations. He thinks Porfiry reckoned on him doing this, then catching him on the detail of the dates.

Raskolnikov suddenly tells Razumihin to go into Bakaleyev's alone, saying he'll be back in half an hour. Razumihin, seeing his despair, gives up trying to follow and goes in, swearing to ""squeeze Porfiry like a lemon.""

Raskolnikov returns to his room, his hair soaked with sweat. He checks the hole under the wallpaper where he hid the items, fearing something might have slipped out. He feels a strange, humiliated smile. As he leaves, the porter points him out to a short, grim-looking man in a long coat, who then walks away without a word. Raskolnikov follows him, asking why he was inquiring about him. The man turns and says, ""Murderer!"" Raskolnikov's legs feel weak, his heart pounds. He asks, ""Who is a murderer?"" The man replies, ""_You_ are a murderer,"" with a smile of ""triumphant hatred."" The man turns and leaves.

Raskolnikov returns to his garret, feeling chilled. He collapses on the sofa, thinking nothing, but images from his childhood and the murder whirl in his mind. He pretends to be asleep when Razumihin and Nastasya return. He then questions the man's identity and how he knew. He speculates about Nikolay's jewel-case discovery and how a small clue could be built into evidence. He despises his physical weakness and curses his decision to shed blood. He contrasts himself with the ""real _Master_"" (Napoleon), who can commit massacres without remorse, and concludes he is merely an ""æsthetic louse."" He hates the old woman, wishes he could kill her again, and wonders why Lizaveta came in. He then thinks of Sonia, ""Poor gentle things, with gentle eyes...."" He loses consciousness.

He has a dream where the old woman is sitting in his former flat, laughing silently while he tries to kill her with an axe, and laughter and whispering come from the bedroom, and a crowd of people watch. He wakes to find a stranger, Arkady Ivanovitch Svidrigaïlov, standing in his doorway.

**Part IV**

**Chapter I**
Raskolnikov is astonished to see Svidrigaïlov, thinking it's still a dream. Svidrigaïlov introduces himself and states he has two reasons for his visit: to make Raskolnikov's acquaintance and to seek his help in a matter concerning Dounia, as she is prejudiced against him. Raskolnikov dismisses his request. Svidrigaïlov says he knows Raskolnikov's family arrived yesterday and asks what Raskolnikov finds ""criminal"" in his past behavior towards Dounia. He argues his attraction to her was natural, and he may have been a victim himself.

Raskolnikov, disgusted, tells Svidrigaïlov he is disliked and unwanted. Svidrigaïlov laughs, admitting he tried to ""get round"" Raskolnikov. He then mentions Marfa Petrovna. Raskolnikov rudely asks if he ""got rid of Marfa Petrovna, too."" Svidrigaïlov calmly replies that her death was attributed to apoplexy, but he wonders if he ""morally"" contributed to it through irritation, though he dismisses the idea. Raskolnikov laughs.

Svidrigaïlov confesses he only struck her twice with a switch, causing no marks, and believes Marfa Petrovna was ""pleased"" by his ""warmth"" because she had been publicly humiliated by the scandal with Dounia. He states that women sometimes ""love to be insulted"" and that it's their ""only amusement."" He recounts his harmonious seven-year marriage, during which he only used the whip twice, apart from an ""ambiguous"" third time. He then brings up an old news story about a nobleman thrashing a German woman on a train, implicitly defending such actions if the ""Germans"" are provoking.

Raskolnikov asks if Svidrigaïlov has been talking to anyone. Svidrigaïlov says almost no one, admits he is bored, and enjoys talking to Raskolnikov due to his ""interesting type."" He mentions Raskolnikov's strange behavior in the street, muttering to himself. Raskolnikov asks if he knows he is being followed. Svidrigaïlov says no.

Raskolnikov, impatiently, warns Svidrigaïlov that if he maintains his ""former intentions"" towards Dounia and tries to exploit Raskolnikov's secret, he will kill him. He then demands Svidrigaïlov reveal anything he has to tell him. Svidrigaïlov denies any specific designs but expresses interest in Raskolnikov's ""fantastic nature"" and his connection to Dounia. He admits he too had hoped to gain ""profit"" from Raskolnikov.

Svidrigaïlov mentions his past as a cavalry officer, gambler, and card-sharper. He was bought out of debtors' prison by Marfa Petrovna for 30,000 roubles, and she held the IOU over him. He says he didn't leave her because he ""didn't want to go anywhere else."" He mentions his recurring ""ghosts"" of Marfa Petrovna, whom he has seen three times since her death. Raskolnikov advises him to see a doctor. Svidrigaïlov, looking oddly at Raskolnikov, asks if he believes ghosts exist. Raskolnikov vehemently says no. Svidrigaïlov suggests ghosts are ""shreds and fragments of other worlds"" visible to the sick, and that eternity might be ""one little room, like a bath house in the country, black and grimy and spiders in every corner."" This thought chills Raskolnikov.

Svidrigaïlov asks about Dounia's marriage to Luzhin. Raskolnikov forbids him from mentioning his sister's name. Svidrigaïlov, unperturbed, states Luzhin is ""no match for Avdotya Romanovna"" and believes Dounia is sacrificing herself for her family. He candidly admits his initial strong feelings for Dounia have vanished. He then offers Dounia 10,000 roubles to break off the engagement with Luzhin, suggesting it would be to her advantage. Raskolnikov calls him mad. Svidrigaïlov argues the money is ""perfectly free"" and he has ""no ulterior motive,"" merely wishing to show he can do good, not just harm. He mentions he is about to marry a young lady, which should dispel suspicion. Raskolnikov refuses to convey the offer. Svidrigaïlov threatens to see her himself.

Before leaving, Svidrigaïlov reveals that Marfa Petrovna left Dounia 3,000 roubles in her will, to be received in two or three weeks. He runs into Razumihin on his way out.

**Chapter II**
Raskolnikov and Razumihin hurry to Bakaleyev's. Raskolnikov tells Razumihin about Svidrigaïlov's visit, his strange behavior, and his fear that Svidrigaïlov still has designs on Dounia. Razumihin promises to guard her. Raskolnikov then expresses a strange thought that Svidrigaïlov's visit might have been an ""hallucination."" Razumihin recounts his failed attempt to get information from Porfiry and Zametov about Raskolnikov's case, concluding he should simply mystify them further.

They arrive at Bakaleyev's. Luzhin is already there. They all sit around a table. Luzhin formally asks about their journey and Dounia's fatigue. Pulcheria Alexandrovna praises Razumihin for saving them yesterday. Luzhin gives Razumihin a hostile glance. Pulcheria Alexandrovna mentions Marfa Petrovna's death, and Luzhin reveals Svidrigaïlov has rushed to Petersburg, ""doubtless not without some design."" Dounia is alarmed. Luzhin claims Svidrigaïlov is depraved and vicious, and that Marfa Petrovna covered up a past crime involving the suicide of a deaf-mute girl and ill-treatment of a footman. Dounia defends Svidrigaïlov regarding the footman. Luzhin suggests Dounia is defending Svidrigaïlov.

Raskolnikov breaks his silence, stating Svidrigaïlov has just visited him, wants an interview with Dounia, and offered her 10,000 roubles. He also reveals Marfa Petrovna left Dounia 3,000 roubles. Pulcheria Alexandrovna is overjoyed by the inheritance. Luzhin looks at his watch, preparing to leave, but Dounia insists he stay for an explanation about his letter. Luzhin, aggrieved, asserts there are insults that cannot be forgotten and ""a line in everything which it is dangerous to overstep."" Dounia states that her whole future depends on settling this, and if Rodya has insulted him, he will apologize. She insists that she must choose between Luzhin and her brother if they cannot reconcile.

Luzhin, offended, says her words are ""offensive"" and that love for her husband should outweigh love for her brother. He then recounts how Raskolnikov ""misrepresented"" his words about marrying a poor girl. Pulcheria Alexandrovna denies Raskolnikov exaggerated. Raskolnikov sharply points out Luzhin's false accusation about him giving money to Sonia, calling it ""mean slander."" He asserts Luzhin is not ""worth the little finger of that unfortunate girl."" Luzhin asks if Raskolnikov would let Sonia associate with his mother and sister. Raskolnikov replies he already made her sit with them today. Luzhin, now furious, states he will withdraw and requests to be spared ""similar meetings, and, so to say, compromises."" Pulcheria Alexandrovna, offended, reminds him they came relying on him. Luzhin sarcastically credits her new tone to Marfa Petrovna's legacy. Dounia, white with anger, tells Luzhin to ""go away."" Luzhin, shocked, states he will never come back if he leaves now. Dounia insists, ""I don’t want you to come back again."" Luzhin threatens to ""protest."" Pulcheria Alexandrovna defends Dounia. Raskolnikov laughs, further enraging Luzhin. Dounia calls him a ""mean and spiteful man!"" Raskolnikov holds back Razumihin and quietly tells Luzhin to leave. Luzhin departs, filled with ""vindictive hatred.""

**Chapter III**
Luzhin, never expecting such a rupture, is devastated. His vanity and conceit are wounded. He had dreamt of a virtuous, poor, humbled young bride over whom he would have ""absolute, unbounded power."" Dounia's beauty and education, combined with her helpless position, had allured him. He had hoped for her to help him rise in society in Petersburg. Now, all is in ruins. He blames Raskolnikov and Svidrigaïlov.

Dounia apologizes to her mother and brother for being tempted by Luzhin's money, insisting she had no idea he was so ""base."" Pulcheria Alexandrovna is relieved. They all laugh except Raskolnikov, who remains sullen and indifferent, despite being the one who insisted on getting rid of Luzhin. Dounia questions why he is still angry.

Dounia asks Raskolnikov what Svidrigaïlov said. He repeats the offer of 10,000 roubles and his desire for an interview. Pulcheria Alexandrovna is horrified at the money offer. Raskolnikov recounts his conversation with Svidrigaïlov, omitting the ghosts. He admits he doesn't understand Svidrigaïlov but suspects he has a ""bad motive."" Dounia, strangely impressed by the offer, shudders, believing Svidrigaïlov has a ""terrible plan."" Raskolnikov tells her he expects to see Svidrigaïlov again. Razumihin vows to watch Svidrigaïlov and asks Dounia for permission to do so, which she grants with a smile.

Razumihin then proposes a business plan: using the 3,000 roubles from Marfa Petrovna's legacy and another 1,000 from his uncle to set up a publishing business. He explains his experience and knowledge of the publishing world, promising good profits. Dounia's eyes shine, and Raskolnikov supports the idea. Razumihin suggests they take a furnished flat in the same house.

Raskolnikov abruptly takes his cap, preparing to leave. He says, ""One would think you were burying me or saying good-bye for ever... But who knows, perhaps it is the last time we shall see each other."" His mother is distraught. He tells them it would be better for them to part for a time, as he feels ill and not at peace, and might begin to hate them if they don't leave him alone. He says he will come back ""when it's possible."" Dounia calls him a ""wicked, heartless egoist."" Razumihin whispers to Dounia that Raskolnikov is ""insane, but not heartless."" He runs after Raskolnikov, who repeats his demand for solitude but asks Razumihin to stay with his mother and sister. They stand in silence for a minute, and Razumihin realizes with a start that Raskolnikov's burning eyes have pierced his soul, understanding something ""awful, hideous, and suddenly understood on both sides."" Raskolnikov asks, ""Do you understand now?"" and leaves. Razumihin returns to comfort the ladies, taking his place as a son and brother.

**Chapter IV**
Raskolnikov goes to Sonia's lodging. She is startled to see him. He tells her Amalia Ivanovna is turning Katerina Ivanovna out and that Katerina Ivanovna has gone ""to seek justice."" Sonia wants to go to them, but Raskolnikov tells her to stay with him. He asks her what she would do if she knew Luzhin's actions would ruin Katerina Ivanovna and the children, and if she had to choose between Luzhin living or Katerina Ivanovna dying. Sonia says she cannot know ""Divine Providence"" and has no right to judge. Raskolnikov is frustrated.

He then confesses he came to ask forgiveness, not as he said yesterday. He admits to a ""bitter hatred"" for Sonia, but it vanishes when he sees love in her eyes. He sits on her bed. Sonia, terrified, asks what's wrong. He says he came to tell her who killed Lizaveta, confirming his words from yesterday. Sonia is terrified, asking how he knows. He tells her to guess. She can't. He tells her he is a ""great friend of *his*"" (the murderer), and that the murderer didn't mean to kill Lizaveta, but she ""happened to come in."" Sonia, seeing Lizaveta's face in Raskolnikov's, clasps her hands and cries, ""Good God!"" She falls to her knees before him, embracing him.

He is surprised by her reaction. She cries, ""There is no one--no one in the whole world now so unhappy as you!"" He feels a long unfamiliar softening in his heart. He asks if she will leave him. She cries, ""No, no, never, nowhere! I will follow you, I will follow you everywhere. ... I’ll follow you to Siberia!""

He recoils, and a hostile smile returns. He says he might not want to go to Siberia *yet*. Sonia, confused, wonders if he is the murderer. He wearily says he did it ""to plunder."" She asks if he was hungry, if it was to help his mother. He denies it was the ""real thing."" She asks about the money he gave Katerina Ivanovna, suspecting it was from the crime. He quickly clarifies that was his own money, sent by his mother, which Razumihin received. He then says he doesn't know if there was any money from the old woman, as he didn't look in the chamois leather purse, but he buried the purse and trinkets under a stone in a yard. Sonia, grasping for hope, asks why he took nothing if he did it to rob. He replies he hasn't decided whether to take the money.

He tells her that if he had killed ""simply because I was hungry,"" he would be ""happy now."" He came to her because she is all he has left, asking her not to leave him. He admits he didn't know *where* he was asking her to go yesterday. He confesses he came to throw his burden on her, to make her suffer too. Sonia cries that he is suffering also. He admits he has a ""bad heart"" and is a ""coward and... a mean wretch.""

He declares he killed because he ""wanted to become a Napoleon,"" and believed ""whoever is strong in mind and spirit will have power over them."" He says he ""wanted *to have the daring*... and I killed her. I only wanted to have the daring, Sonia! That was the whole cause of it!"" Sonia cries that he ""turned away from God and God has smitten you, has given you over to the devil!"" He agrees, saying the devil led him. He admits he knew he wasn't Napoleon, and murdered for ""myself alone,"" not for money or to help his mother, but to see ""whether I was a louse like everybody else or a man.""

Sonia cries, ""You murdered her!"" He replies he murdered himself, not her, and that ""it was the devil that killed that old woman, not I."" Sonia asks what he is to do now. She tells him to go at once to the cross-roads, bow down, kiss the earth, and say aloud, ""I am a murderer!"" so God will send him life again. He gloomily asks if she means Siberia and that he must give himself up. She insists he must ""suffer and expiate your sin by it."" He refuses to give himself up. Sonia cries that he cannot live by himself and will have nothing. He asks what wrong he has done them, calling society ""knaves and scoundrels."" He says he will make ""another fight for it.""

He tells her the police are after him. Sonia cries out. He assures her he won't give himself up, as they have no real evidence. He promises to manage his mother and sister, and asks if she will visit him in prison. She says she will. Sonia gives him a cypress wood cross, saying she will wear Lizaveta’s copper one, and they will ""suffer together, and together we will bear our cross!"" He takes it, but then pulls his hand back, saying ""Not now, Sonia. Better later.""

Three knocks sound at the door. Lebeziatnikov appears, looking perturbed.

**Chapter V**
Lebeziatnikov blurts out that Katerina Ivanovna has gone out of her mind. He describes her coming back, having been turned out and perhaps beaten, after trying to see her father's former chief. She is now screaming, flinging herself about, saying she will take the children into the street with a barrel-organ to beg, to shame the general. She is teaching the children to sing and dance, tearing clothes to make costumes. Sonia, horrified, snatches her cloak and runs out, followed by Raskolnikov and Lebeziatnikov.

Lebeziatnikov explains Katerina Ivanovna's madness is likely due to consumption affecting her brain. He discusses the logical curing of insanity. Raskolnikov, no longer listening, goes to his room. He feels fearfully alone and wonders if he will now hate Sonia for making her more miserable. He resolves to stay alone and not let her come to prison. He then thinks, ""Perhaps it really would be better in Siberia.""

Dounia enters, saying she knows ""all, all"" about his persecution through ""stupid and contemptible suspicion."" She tells him Razumihin explained there is no danger. She doesn't judge him for cutting himself off and promises to reassure their mother. She offers her life to him if he needs her. Raskolnikov tells her Razumihin is a ""very good fellow."" Dounia, alarmed, asks if they are parting forever. He replies, ""Never mind.... Good-bye,"" and walks to the window. Dounia leaves, troubled.

Raskolnikov wonders if Dounia could truly bear the suffering. He thinks of Sonia. He wanders, feeling a ""cold leaden misery."" Lebeziatnikov rushes up to him, telling him Katerina Ivanovna has taken the children to the canal bank, near Sonia's lodging. She is rapping on a frying-pan (though Raskolnikov doesn't see it), making the children dance and sing, screaming at them, and appealing to passersby. Sonia follows, weeping, trying to persuade her to go home. Katerina Ivanovna rages about her husband's service, her aristocratic family, and the general who ignored her. She throws an inkpot at him. She shows Raskolnikov the two farthings Polenka collected, calling the crowd ""mean wretches."" She tries to make her children sing a French song to prove their good breeding.

An official approaches and gives Katerina Ivanovna three roubles. She thanks him loftily, continuing her tirade, and then points to a policeman, screaming for protection. The policeman says begging is forbidden. Katerina Ivanovna stumbles and falls. They discover she is bleeding from her chest, a sign of advanced consumption. Sonia implores them to bring Katerina Ivanovna to her room.

They carry Katerina Ivanovna to Sonia's room and lay her on the bed. Raskolnikov, Lebeziatnikov, and the official enter, followed by the Kapernaumovs and their children. Svidrigaïlov suddenly appears. Katerina Ivanovna, regaining consciousness, asks for her children. She tells Sonia, ""Well, here they are, Sonia, take them all! I hand them over to you, I’ve had enough! The ball is over."" She refuses a priest, stating she has ""no sins."" She dies in delirium, singing fragments of songs. Sonia falls upon her, weeping. Polenka, Kolya, and Lida cry. Raskolnikov notices Katerina Ivanovna's ""certificate of merit"" on the bed.

Svidrigaïlov pulls Raskolnikov aside and states he will undertake all arrangements for Katerina Ivanovna's funeral and place the three children in good orphan asylums, settling 1,500 roubles on each. He also promises to ""pull [Sonia] out of the mud."" He tells Raskolnikov to inform Dounia that this is how he is spending her 10,000 roubles. Raskolnikov asks his motive. Svidrigaïlov laughs, saying it's ""humanity"" and points to the dead Katerina Ivanovna, recalling Raskolnikov's own phrase: ""She wasn’t ‘a louse,’ you know... like some old pawnbroker woman? Come, you’ll agree, is Luzhin to go on living, and doing wicked things or is she to die?"" Raskolnikov turns pale, realizing Svidrigaïlov overheard him talking to Sonia. Svidrigaïlov confirms he was lodging in the next room, at Madame Resslich's, and ""listened at the door"" to their conversation. He assures Raskolnikov they will become friends.

**Part VI**

**Chapter I**
Raskolnikov enters a strange period of mental fog and solitude. He remembers confused facts and exaggerated phantoms. Svidrigaïlov's words about overhearing him torment him, but he avoids confronting him. He meets Svidrigaïlov several times at Sonia's, where Svidrigaïlov is arranging Katerina Ivanovna's funeral, but they tacitly avoid the crucial subject. Svidrigaïlov tells him the children are well provided for and promises to consult with Raskolnikov soon. He says, ""what all men need is fresh air.""

Raskolnikov attends Katerina Ivanovna's requiem service in Sonia's room. Sonia, who has not spoken to him for two days, lays her head on his shoulder, showing no repugnance. He feels miserable. He realizes he can't be alone but also feels uneasy in crowds. He decides to seek another ""struggle"" with Porfiry or Svidrigaïlov. He returns home after sleeping in bushes, and feels clearer.

Razumihin enters, expressing annoyance at Raskolnikov's ""stupid, repulsive and quite inexplicable actions,"" especially his treatment of his mother and sister, and concludes he must be mad. Raskolnikov asks when he last saw them. Razumihin says just now; his mother is ill in bed, believing Raskolnikov has a ""girl"" (Sonia). Razumihin went to Sonia's, saw the coffin, and realized Raskolnikov had no girl. He then concludes Raskolnikov is not mad, but there's a secret. He swears at Raskolnikov and leaves.

Raskolnikov asks Razumihin what he said about him to Dounia. Razumihin replies he told her he was a good, honest man and that she already knows he loves her. Raskolnikov tells Razumihin he is entrusting his mother and sister to his keeping, implying Dounia may love him. He also mentions Svidrigaïlov's ""fresh air"" remark.

Razumihin leaves, suddenly suspecting Raskolnikov is a ""political conspirator"" and Dounia knows. He remembers the scene in the corridor and realizes he wronged Raskolnikov by suspecting him. He runs back to the Palais de Cristal to question Zametov.

Raskolnikov feels renewed, ready for a new struggle. He still feels Svidrigaïlov is a riddle but that Porfiry is a different matter. He ponders Porfiry's ""psychological"" explanation to Razumihin, realizing Porfiry couldn't truly believe Nikolay's confession after their previous interview. He resolves to confront Svidrigaïlov. As he opens his door, Porfiry Petrovitch appears, having come to visit him. Raskolnikov is startled but instantly on guard.

**Chapter II**
Porfiry Petrovitch, lighting a cigarette, admits his ""pernicious"" habit. He then reveals he visited Raskolnikov's room two days ago, found his door open, looked around, and left without being seen. He explains he came to have an ""open"" talk with Raskolnikov, admitting he acted ""unfairly"" before. He says Nikolay's confession put a stop to his suspicions. He explains his ""psychological"" method: he let Raskolnikov ""walk about the town a bit"" in hopes he would ""lose his head"" and come to him. He was counting on Raskolnikov's ""nervously irritable"" temperament to betray him.

Raskolnikov, amazed, wonders if Porfiry believes him innocent. Porfiry recounts how he initially suspected Raskolnikov based on rumors, an unconscious report of his behavior at the police office, and Raskolnikov's article. He admits he ""jeered"" at Raskolnikov to provoke him and confesses he had Raskolnikov's room searched while he was ill, but found nothing. He then explains how they ""arranged"" for Razumihin to discuss the murder case with Raskolnikov to further excite him. He then reminds Raskolnikov of the ""stone"" under which the things were hidden, and how Raskolnikov mentioned it to Zametov and again in Porfiry's office.

Porfiry then describes how he caught himself, questioning if he was being carried away by ""notions,"" especially with Nikolay's actual evidence. But then he remembered the ""bell-ringing"" incident, which gave him his ""little fact."" He describes Raskolnikov walking beside the workman who called him ""murderer"" without asking a question. Porfiry asks Raskolnikov if he is surprised at his ""pranks.""

Raskolnikov, cold and trembling, thinks Porfiry is trying to scare him, not having real proofs. He asserts he has admitted nothing. Porfiry, increasingly playful, insists Raskolnikov is a ""monomaniac."" He continues to provoke Raskolnikov, pointing out his ""suspiciousness"" and how he gives everything away in his excitement. He ironically asks why, if he suspected Raskolnikov, he would have ""betrayed a precious thing like that, a real fact (for it is a fact worth having)"" by mentioning the bell-ringing incident.

Raskolnikov cries out that Porfiry is lying. Porfiry admits he is ""lying,"" but only as part of his game, using ""psychological means of defence"" for Raskolnikov (illness, delirium). He then asks why Raskolnikov, if guilty, would insist he was not delirious. Raskolnikov denies being delirious. Porfiry says Raskolnikov's policy of not concealing his part with Razumihin is also suspicious. Raskolnikov, shaking, accuses Porfiry of trying to frighten him.

Porfiry then makes a direct ""proposition"": Raskolnikov should ""surrender and confess."" He says it will be ""infinitely more to your advantage."" Raskolnikov argues that if he is guilty, there's no reason to confess if he's safer in prison. Porfiry replies that prison might not be restful and that a confession, especially now that Nikolay has muddled the case, would ""lessen your sentence."" He promises to arrange for the confession to be a ""complete surprise,"" making the crime appear an ""aberration.""

Raskolnikov, mournful, rejects the idea of a lessened sentence. Porfiry passionately urges him not to ""disdain life,"" suggesting suffering is good and that this might be ""God’s means for bringing you to Him."" He says Raskolnikov is afraid of ""bourgeois disgrace"" but should ""fling yourself straight into life, without deliberation."" He insists Raskolnikov won't run away.

Raskolnikov, starting, asks, ""But who are you? what prophet are you?"" Porfiry replies he is ""a man with nothing to hope for,"" but Raskolnikov has life before him. He again encourages Raskolnikov to ""be the sun."" Raskolnikov asks when he means to arrest him. Porfiry says he can walk about ""another day or two,"" encouraging him to pray. Raskolnikov asks, ""And what if I run away?"" Porfiry replies he won't, that he is ""psychologically unable to escape me,"" comparing him to a butterfly around a candle. He says Raskolnikov will confess voluntarily, and that ""suffering... is a great thing.""

Raskolnikov insists he has confessed nothing. Porfiry agrees, but adds, ""If anything were to happen... do leave a brief but precise note, only two lines, and mention the stone."" Porfiry leaves, stooping. Raskolnikov waits, then hurries out.

**Chapter III**
Raskolnikov hurries to Svidrigaïlov's, feeling a ""hidden power"" over him. He wonders if Svidrigaïlov has been to Porfiry's, deciding he hasn't yet, and feels a desperate fatigue. He questions if it's worth contending with new difficulties. He feels a growing anguish that Svidrigaïlov might still have designs on Dounia and might use his secret against her. He decides, in cold despair, ""then I shall kill him.""

He finds himself in X. Prospect, near a noisy tavern. He sees Svidrigaïlov sitting at a tea-table in an open window, watching him. Svidrigaïlov laughs and invites him in. Raskolnikov finds Svidrigaïlov in a back room with champagne, a boy with a hand organ, and a young girl singing. Svidrigaïlov dismisses them. Raskolnikov states he was looking for him. Svidrigaïlov suggests Raskolnikov came by ""miracle,"" but then says he himself told Raskolnikov the tavern's location and hours, implying Raskolnikov came mechanically. He observes Raskolnikov's strange walking habits and talking to himself, suggesting Petersburg is a town of ""crazy people."" He says he knows Raskolnikov is being followed.

Raskolnikov, irritated, asks why Svidrigaïlov hid if he expected him. Svidrigaïlov retorts that Raskolnikov also pretended to be asleep when he visited. Raskolnikov, impatient, demands to know Svidrigaïlov's purpose. He threatens to kill Svidrigaïlov if he continues his designs on Dounia and demands he speak quickly. Svidrigaïlov mockingly denies specific aims, saying he came out of ""curiosity"" about Raskolnikov's ""fantastic nature."" He confesses he hoped Raskolnikov would tell him something new. He describes his idle, depraved life, including being a card-sharper.

Svidrigaïlov admits he came to Petersburg ""for the sake of the women,"" and describes Marfa Petrovna's ""insane"" love for him. He recounts their ""contract"" allowing him freedom with maidservants as long as he stayed with her and didn't fall in love with women of their class, or set up a permanent mistress. He reveals Marfa Petrovna fell in love with Dounia, and he himself ""had a most irresistible physical desire"" for her. He describes Dounia as ""awfully chaste, incredibly and phenomenally so."" He recounts Dounia demanding he leave a servant girl alone, leading to ""interviews, mysterious conversations, exhortations."" He used flattery to ""seduce"" her. He admits his ""stupid and impatient"" actions spoiled it all, causing Dounia to flash her eyes at him. He was brought to a ""frenzy"" and offered Dounia 30,000 roubles to run away with him to Petersburg, which he says was ""just the same thing as I was proposing"" as Luzhin's marriage.

Raskolnikov, furious, says he is convinced Svidrigaïlov has designs on Dounia. Svidrigaïlov mockingly denies it, claiming Dounia ""can't endure"" him. Raskolnikov insists he still has evil designs. Svidrigaïlov again denies it, attributing it to his being ""drunk."" He then reveals he is getting married to a sixteen-year-old girl, an arrangement made by Madame Resslich. He describes his fiancée as a beautiful, shy, ""Madonna-like"" girl whom he has already given 1,500 roubles worth of presents. He delights in the age difference and her innocent devotion. He then talks about his love for children and recounts how he helped a thirteen-year-old girl who was forced to dance the cancan in a ""frightful den,"" by offering to pay for her education.

Raskolnikov, disgusted by his ""vile, nasty anecdotes,"" tries to leave. Svidrigaïlov, now drunk, suggests Raskolnikov is a cynic too. Svidrigaïlov leaves, with Raskolnikov deciding to follow him.

**Chapter V**
Raskolnikov follows Svidrigaïlov, declaring he won't lose sight of him. They confront each other. Raskolnikov asserts Svidrigaïlov still has designs on Dounia, citing her letter this morning. Svidrigaïlov, initially threatening to call the police, then becomes mirthful, inviting Raskolnikov to follow him home. He states Sonia is not home, having taken the children to a lady who helps orphans, where Svidrigaïlov charmed the lady and deposited money for the children. He told the lady Sonia's story in full.

Svidrigaïlov returns to his room, and Raskolnikov follows. Svidrigaïlov mocks Raskolnikov's ""Schiller"" like morality and his ""sighing and groaning."" He suggests Raskolnikov should either inform the police of his ""misfortune"" or go to America. He offers Raskolnikov money for the fare. Raskolnikov, disgusted, refuses. Svidrigaïlov then shows Raskolnikov his rooms, which are connected to Sonia's by a locked door. He admits he sat and listened to Raskolnikov's confession to Sonia from his room, through the wall.

Dounia appears, having followed Raskolnikov. She is distraught, believing Svidrigaïlov has lied about Sonia's whereabouts. She confronts Svidrigaïlov with his letter, accusing him of hinting at her brother's crime. She demands he prove it. Svidrigaïlov mockingly points out she risked coming alone to his rooms because she wants to know. He then calmly tells her that Raskolnikov confessed to Sonia that he murdered the old pawnbroker and Lizaveta with an axe, taking money and things, which he hid under a stone. Dounia, with white lips, refuses to believe it. Svidrigaïlov explains Raskolnikov's theory about ""extraordinary"" men having the right to transgress the law, his Napoleon complex, and his humiliation at being unable to boldly overstep the law. He adds that Raskolnikov has no remorse.

Dounia, almost fainting, asks how to save him. Svidrigaïlov says it ""all depends on you, on you, on you alone."" He says he has money and friends and can get Raskolnikov abroad with a passport. He confesses his love for Dounia, promising to be her slave, to do anything if she just says ""do that."" Dounia, terrified, rushes to the door, demanding he open it. Svidrigaïlov says he has lost the key. Dounia barricades herself with a table and pulls out a revolver.

Svidrigaïlov is surprised but maliciously smiles, recognizing the revolver as Marfa Petrovna's. Dounia accuses him of killing Marfa Petrovna. She warns him that if he moves, she will shoot. Svidrigaïlov, calmly, takes a step. Dounia shoots, grazing his hair. She cocks the pistol again. He approaches, saying he can seize her before she fires again. She shoots again, but it misfires. She flings the revolver away. Svidrigaïlov, relieved, gently puts his arm around her. She asks him to let her go. He asks if she doesn't love him, if she never can. She shakes her head, ""Never!"" After a terrible, silent struggle, he withdraws his arm, turns to the window, and places the key to the door on the table. He tells her to ""Make haste!"" Dounia snatches the key and rushes out. Svidrigaïlov stands at the window, smiling a ""pitiful, sad, weak smile of despair."" He picks up the revolver and puts it in his pocket.

**Chapter VI**
Svidrigaïlov spends the evening in low haunts, treating people, but drinking only tea. He returns home drenched by a thunderstorm, tears up papers, puts money in his pocket, and goes to Sonia's. He tells Sonia he is going to America and that he has provided for Katerina Ivanovna's children, giving her the receipts. He then gives Sonia three thousand roubles in five-per-cent bonds for herself, urging her to keep it secret and not live ""in the old way."" He tells her Raskolnikov has two alternatives: ""a bullet in the brain or Siberia,"" and that if it's Siberia, she will follow him and need the money. He advises her to hide the money and give it to Razumihin later.

At twenty past eleven, he visits the parents of his sixteen-year-old fiancée, gives her 15,000 roubles, and leaves. At midnight, he crosses the bridge back to the mainland. He walks through the dark streets, finds a dirty wooden hotel called Adrianople, and takes a tiny, low-pitched room under the stairs. He overhears an argument next door. He can't sleep, haunted by images of Dounia. He has a nightmare about a drowned girl, fourteen years old, with a broken heart, lying in a flower-filled coffin. He wakes.

He then dreams of a five-year-old girl, wet and shivering, who has broken a cup and fears a beating from her drunken mother. He takes her to his bed, undresses her, and covers her. As she sleeps, her flushed cheeks and smiling lips transform into a ""shameless face of a French harlot,"" laughing and inviting him. He cries out, raising his hand to strike her, and wakes.

He is angry and shattered. He writes a few lines in his notebook, stating he dies ""in full possession of his faculties and that no one is to blame for his death."" He puts the revolver in his pocket and goes out into the thick mist. He walks to the Little Neva, thinking of Petrovsky Island and the bush. He passes a drunken man and a shivering dog. He reaches a big stone house with a tower and speaks to a drowsy man in a soldier's coat, Achilles, who asks what he wants. Svidrigaïlov says he's going ""to foreign parts,"" ""to America."" He pulls out the revolver and cocks it. Achilles says it's ""not the place for such jokes!"" Svidrigaïlov puts the revolver to his right temple and tells Achilles to say he was going to America. Achilles, now fully roused, cries, ""You can't do it here, it’s not the place!"" Svidrigaïlov pulls the trigger.

**Chapter VII**
The same evening, about seven o'clock, Raskolnikov goes to his mother's and sister's lodging. He is dishevelled, soaked, and exhausted. His mother, Pulcheria Alexandrovna, greets him with joy and tears, saying she now understands his eccentricity and his new ideas. She shows him his article in the ""Periodical Review,"" which Razumihin brought her. She believes he will be a leading Russian thinker. She asks about Dounia. He promises he still loves her.

Raskolnikov asks his mother if, whatever happens or whatever she hears, she will always love him. She assures him she will. He confesses he has always loved her more than himself and that her past thoughts of him being cruel were a mistake. They embrace, both weeping. He is glad to be alone with her, his heart softened for the first time in months. She reveals she had a foreboding of trouble and that Dounia talked in her sleep about him. She senses he is going away. He confirms he is going ""Very far"" and asks her to pray for him. He tears himself away from her embraces.

He returns to his lodging. Dounia is waiting for him, having been with Sonia all day. She tells him she knows ""all, all"" about his persecution and assures him there is no danger, but she fears the indignation will permanently affect him. She offers her life to him. He tells her Razumihin is a very good fellow. Dounia, alarmed, asks if they are parting forever. He says, ""Never mind.... Good-bye.""

Alone, he thinks Dounia could not have stood the test. He then thinks of Sonia. He recalls he was afraid of drowning himself but his pride wouldn't let him be afraid of disgrace. He tells Dounia, ""I am going at once to give myself up. But I don’t know why I am going to give myself up."" Dounia cries, embraces him, and asks if he is ""half expiating your crime by facing the suffering?"" He cries, ""Crime? What crime?"" and launches into a furious, frantic defense of his act, calling the old woman a ""vile noxious insect."" He insists he is not expiating a crime, but facing ""superfluous disgrace"" because he is ""contemptible."" He asserts that killing her was ""atonement for forty sins"" and that he is ""further than ever from seeing that what I did was a crime.""

Seeing Dounia's anguish, he softens. He asks her forgiveness, saying he has made them both miserable. He asks her not to follow him, but to stay with their mother. He promises he won't disgrace them and might ""make a name."" He gives Dounia a water-color portrait of his deceased fiancée, his landlady's daughter, saying he confided much to her. He then expresses his despair over the ""senseless sufferings"" awaiting him and questions if he wants it himself. Dounia leaves, looking back at him. He thinks of how he hates ""them all"" but questions why he is going to be humbled. He thinks it must be so, that ""water wears out a stone.""

**Chapter VIII**
Raskolnikov goes to Sonia's room. She has been waiting for him with Dounia, who has now gone to Raskolnikov's room. Sonia is tortured by the dread of his suicide. Raskolnikov enters. He tells her he has come for her cross, mocking her fear now that his confession is imminent. He says he is going to the ""Explosive Lieutenant"" to make a ""sensation."" He takes the wooden cross, saying it is the ""symbol of my taking up the cross."" He gives her Lizaveta's copper cross. He is agitated and forgetful. He tells her he came to warn her, and that he is going to prison, fulfilling her wish. He hates it all. Sonia begs him to cross himself and say a prayer. He does so, sincerely. He notices she means to go with him and cries out in ""cowardly vexation,"" telling her to stay. He leaves, without saying good-bye, a ""poignant and rebellious doubt"" in his heart.

He walks to the Hay Market, filled with disgust and a longing to be alone, but knowing he cannot. He remembers Sonia's words: ""Go to the cross-roads, bow down to the people, kiss the earth... and say aloud... 'I am a murderer.'"" He trembles, then a ""fit"" of ""new unmixed, complete sensation"" comes over him. He falls to his knees in the middle of the square, bows, and kisses the filthy earth with ""bliss and rapture."" Onlookers mock him, thinking he is drunk or going to Jerusalem. The words ""I am a murderer"" die on his lips.

He sees Sonia hiding behind a shanty. He knows she will follow him forever. He walks to the police office, to the ""explosive lieutenant."" He enters the office. Ilya Petrovitch is there, in a good humor. Raskolnikov gives his name. Ilya Petrovitch, rambling on about literature and ""Nihilists,"" then mentions a suicide that morning. Someone from the other room says, ""Svidrigaïlov."" Raskolnikov cries out, ""Svidrigaïlov! Svidrigaïlov has shot himself!"" He admits he knew him, that his sister was governess in his family. Ilya Petrovitch is surprised and asks for details. Raskolnikov leaves, feeling stifled. He is dizzy and reeled.

He goes out into the yard and sees Sonia, pale and horror-stricken. He stands before her, a meaningless smile on his lips. He turns, walks back to the police office, enters, and approaches Ilya Petrovitch. With white lips and staring eyes, he says, ""_It was I killed the old pawnbroker woman and her sister Lizaveta with an axe and robbed them._"" Ilya Petrovitch opens his mouth, and people run up. Raskolnikov repeats his statement.

**Epilogue**

**I**
Nine months later, Raskolnikov is a second-class convict in a Siberian prison. His trial was straightforward: he confessed clearly and firmly, detailing every incident, the secret of the wooden ""pledge"" in the old woman's hand, how he took keys, the chest's contents, Lizaveta's murder, the knocking, hiding in the empty flat, and the stone where he hid the valuables. He didn't remember the trinkets or their quantity, nor had he opened the purse (which contained 317 roubles and 60 copecks). Lawyers suggested temporary mental derangement or homicidal mania, as he hadn't used the stolen money. His hypochondriacal condition was attested to by witnesses and Dr. Zossimov.

Raskolnikov barely defended himself. He stated his motive was poverty and a desire to provide for his early life steps with the 3,000 roubles he expected. He attributed the murder to his ""shallow and cowardly nature."" He said his confession was due to ""heartfelt repentance.""

The sentence was lenient: eight years of penal servitude. Extenuating circumstances included his poverty, abnormal mental state, not using the stolen goods (attributed to remorse or mental state), and Lizaveta's murder further supporting temporary insanity. Razumihin proved Raskolnikov had helped a consumptive student and paid for his funeral, and rescued two children from a fire, suffering burns himself. These facts impressed the court.

During the trial, Raskolnikov's mother fell ill with a nervous disorder affecting her intellect. Dounia and Razumihin moved her to a town near Petersburg. They invented a story for her about Raskolnikov going away on a business commission. Pulcheria Alexandrovna, however, had her own version: Rodya had powerful enemies and was in hiding. She believed he would be a great statesman and continually read his article. She didn't complain about lack of letters, which alarmed Dounia. Dounia realized her mother suspected something terrible.

Five months after the confession, Raskolnikov was sentenced. Razumihin and Sonia visited him in prison. Dounia and Razumihin vowed the separation would not be forever, planning to move to Siberia in three or four years after Razumihin established a livelihood. They all wept at parting. Raskolnikov was anxious about his mother. Sonia, using Svidrigaïlov's money, prepared to follow Raskolnikov. He predicted his mother's death.

Two months later, Dounia married Razumihin. They planned to settle in Siberia within five years. Pulcheria Alexandrovna was pleased by the marriage but became more melancholy. Razumihin tried to cheer her with stories of Raskolnikov's good deeds, which delighted her. She often spoke to strangers about her son's genius and heroism. Her restlessness grew, leading to hysterical animation and delirium. She began preparing for Rodya's return, believing he would be back in nine months. She died of brain fever within a fortnight, her delirium revealing she knew more of his fate than they thought.

Raskolnikov remained unaware of his mother's death for a long time. Sonia corresponded monthly with the Razumihins, giving matter-of-fact details of Raskolnikov's life as a convict, his health, and specific requests, but no personal feelings or hopes. Raskolnikov was sullen, uninterested in news, and often silent. He was indifferent to his surroundings and prison life, living poorly not from design but indifference. He shared a room with other convicts.

Initially, Raskolnikov was vexed by Sonia's visits, but they became a habit and necessity. He was distressed when she was ill. She visited him at the prison gates and at his work sites. Sonia also did sewing in the town. In her last letter, Sonia wrote that Raskolnikov was aloof, disliked by fellow prisoners, and had become very pale and seriously ill in the hospital ward.

**II**
Raskolnikov was ill for a long time. Prison life, hard labor, bad food, shaven head, and patched clothes did not crush him; he was even glad of the work. His pride was wounded because he could not blame himself for his crime, seeing it as a ""simple blunder"" rather than a moral failing. He was ashamed of his ""hopelessly, stupidly"" coming to grief, not the crime itself. He found no particularly terrible fault in his past, believing his theory was no stupider than others. He only recognized his criminality in his failure and confession.

He questioned why he hadn't killed himself, like Svidrigaïlov. He couldn't understand why he chose to live, attributing it to a ""dead weight of instinct."" He saw his fellow prisoners, even tramps, loved life, prizing small things like a ray of sunshine. He felt a ""terrible impossible gulf"" between himself and the other convicts, who disliked him and called him an ""infidel."" During Lent, they attacked him, but he remained calm.

Sonia was universally loved by the convicts, who called her ""Little mother Sofya Semyonovna."" She wrote letters for them, received gifts from their families, and they admired her.

Raskolnikov dreamt that the world was condemned by a new plague from Asia, causing madness, fury, and endless conflict. Only a few chosen people would survive to found a new race. This dream haunted him. After Easter, he began to recover. Sonia had visited him twice during his illness. He saw her at the hospital gate one evening and felt ""something stabbed him to the heart."" He missed her when she didn't come.

He was discharged. Sonia had a cold but sent him a note saying she would visit him at work. His heart throbbed. On a warm spring morning, at work by the Irtish river, he sat gazing at the wide, deserted river and the distant nomad tents. He was troubled by a vague restlessness. Suddenly, Sonia appeared and sat beside him. He did not know how it happened, but he was seized by an impulse and flung himself at her feet, weeping and embracing her knees. Sonia was terrified, then understood, and a ""light of infinite happiness"" filled her eyes. She knew he loved her and that the moment had come.

They could not speak, but tears stood in their eyes. Their pale, thin faces were bright with the dawn of a new future and a full resurrection. They were renewed by love, finding ""infinite sources of life"" in each other. They resolved to wait and be patient for the remaining seven years of his sentence. Raskolnikov felt he had risen again, and Sonia ""only lived in his life.""

That evening, Raskolnikov thought of Sonia. He felt the other convicts looked at him differently, and he even spoke with them. He remembered how he had tormented Sonia, but now he knew he would repay her suffering with ""infinite love."" His past agonies, crime, sentence, and imprisonment now seemed ""an external, strange fact."" He could not think logically; he was simply feeling. ""Life had stepped into the place of theory."" He picked up Sonia's New Testament, which he hadn't opened before. He wondered if her convictions and aspirations would now be his. Sonia, happy but almost frightened by her happiness, was also ill again that night. The narrator concludes by stating this is ""the beginning of a new story--the story of the gradual renewal of a man, the story of his gradual regeneration, of his passing from one world into another, of his initiation into a new unknown life."""
Death in Venice-Thomas Mann,"Gustav Aschenbach, a renowned writer in his fifties, feels overwrought by his work one spring afternoon in 19-- in Munich. During a long walk, he finds himself at the North Cemetery waiting for a tram. There, he observes an unusually appearing, pug-nosed, red-haired man whose presence awakens in Aschenbach a sudden, intense longing for travel, a ""youthful longing after far-off places"" that manifests as a vivid hallucination of a tropical swampland. Though he previously considered travel merely a hygienic necessity, this new urge is a powerful desire to escape the ""steady drudgery"" and creative deadlock of his current work, which he feels lacks emotional fire. He decides to take a three to four-week trip to a pleasant southern resort.

Aschenbach's background is detailed: he is an artist of discipline and tenacity, from a family of severe public servants, though his mother brought a ""more sensuous blood."" He achieved early fame and had to manage a demanding career despite a frail constitution. He consciously cultivated a dignified style, moving away from youthful skepticism. His works often feature a hero-type embodying ""intellectual and youthful masculinity"" that faces adversity with self-mastery. After his wife's death, he settled in Munich and was ennobled as ""von Aschenbach"" on his fiftieth birthday. His artistic life has left deep marks on his face.

Two weeks later, Aschenbach departs for Trieste, then Pola, seeking something foreign and quickly reachable. He stops at an Adriatic island but is displeased by the weather and the lack of a sandy beach. Feeling restless, he abruptly decides to go to Venice. He leaves the island on a motorboat and boards a decrepit ship. On board, he encounters a theatrical ticket-seller and a group of young clerks. He is horrified to realize one of the jovial ""young"" men is an old man in disguise with paint, a wig, and false teeth, and feels a ""dream-like estrangement.""

The journey to Venice is dreary. Aschenbach feels a growing sense of discomfort as the city appears in a misty rain, different from his past experiences. As the ship enters the narrow port, he sees the previously observed old dandy, now painfully drunk and making repulsive, suggestive gestures. Aschenbach feels the world distorting into the ""peculiar and the grotesque."" Finally seeing Venice's iconic sights, he feels it's the only proper way to approach the ""unreal of cities.""

He boards a black Venetian gondola, which evokes feelings of shudder and thoughts of death. The gondolier, a brutal-looking, non-Italian man, insists on taking him directly to the Lido, refusing to go to the steamer dock for the vaporetto. Aschenbach, feeling helpless and suspecting the gondolier is a criminal or trying to cheat him, eventually resigns himself. After being serenaded by musical brigands, they arrive at the Lido dock. Aschenbach goes to get change, and when he returns, the gondola and gondolier have vanished. An old man with a grappling hook informs him the gondolier was unlicensed.

Aschenbach proceeds to his hotel on the beach, where he is given a room with a sea view. Still uneasy from his strange journey, he observes the other guests. He is immediately captivated by a Polish family, particularly a fourteen-year-old boy of ""absolutely beautiful"" and ""godlike"" appearance, Tadzio, who resembles Greek sculpture. Tadzio's older sisters are dressed severely, contrasting with his luxurious English sailor suit. Aschenbach notes Tadzio's pale, ivory-like skin, wondering if he is sickly or merely pampered. Their eyes meet briefly across the lobby. Aschenbach is profoundly touched by the family's formal demeanor.

The next day, the weather is still poor. Aschenbach feels depressed and contemplates leaving, recalling past illness in Venice. At breakfast, Tadzio enters, displaying ""extraordinary charm"" and ""godlike beauty."" Aschenbach, though initially thinking of leaving, decides he must stay as long as the boy. On the beach, he observes Tadzio playing with other children. He notices a moment of ""scorn and detestation"" on Tadzio's face towards a Russian family. Aschenbach, while pretending not to look, feels inexplicably cheered. He deduces the boy's name is Tadzio. He watches Tadzio bathe, emerging from the sea like a ""frail god,"" stirring a ""sense of myth"" in the artist.

Later, in the hotel lift, Aschenbach observes Tadzio close-up, noting his ""jagged and pale"" teeth, brittle enamel, and general frailty, concluding Tadzio is sickly and ""will not grow old."" He refuses to acknowledge a ""gratification or reassurance"" at this thought. That afternoon, Aschenbach visits Venice, but the city's oppressive heat, foul smells, and crowds sicken him, confirming his earlier decision to leave. He makes arrangements for departure the next morning.

However, the next morning, he feels regret, questioning his hasty decision as the air seems fresher. At breakfast, as he prepares to leave, Tadzio enters. Their eyes meet, and Aschenbach whispers a silent ""Good-bye, Tadzio!"" He leaves the hotel, feeling a ""painful journey through all the depths of regret"" on the steamboat. He realizes how deeply he is attached to Venice and the prospect of never seeing it again causes him intense misery and tears. At the station, in a moment of extreme conflict about leaving, he learns his trunk has been mistakenly sent to Como. Aschenbach is seized by ""adventurous delight"" and ""unbelievable hilarity."" He immediately decides to return to the beach hotel to wait for his luggage, feeling that fate has turned him back, rectifying a grave error. Back in his new, identical room, he sees Tadzio again, and realizes with ""exhilaration"" and ""a conflict of pain and pleasure"" that Tadzio was the true reason it was so hard to leave. He performs a ""spontaneous act of welcome, of calm acceptance,"" spreading his arms.

Days turn into weeks under a beautiful, sunny sky. Aschenbach fully unpacks, deciding to remain indefinitely. The easy, splendid rhythm of life, particularly the constant presence of Tadzio, bewitches him. He spends hours on the beach watching the boy, who now regularly walks past his spot, often unnaturally close. Aschenbach feels a connection to Tadzio's beauty, comparing it to ""form as the thought of God."" He is inspired to write, even making his style emulate Tadzio's ""godlike"" body, producing a praised prose piece. He experiences mythical dreams, seeing Tadzio as Hyacinth, the youth loved by gods.

The unique, unspoken relationship with Tadzio intensifies. One evening, Tadzio smiles at Aschenbach, an ""infatuated, and infatuating"" smile like Narcissus, which leaves Aschenbach overwhelmed. He retreats to the dark park, whispering ""I love you!""

In his fourth week, Aschenbach notices fewer guests and overhears the hotel barber mention ""the plague."" Later, in Venice, he detects a ""sweetish and drug-like"" smell and sees official posters euphemistically warning of gastric diseases. He discovers that the authorities are covering up an outbreak of Indian cholera, which is ravaging the city with an 80% fatality rate, leading to increased crime and debauchery among the lower classes. An English clerk confirms the horrific truth and advises Aschenbach to leave immediately before a quarantine is declared.

Aschenbach is ""feverishly excited, triumphant in his possession of the truth,"" but also filled with ""weird horror."" He considers warning Tadzio's mother but ultimately chooses to remain silent, intoxicated by his ""share in the facts and the guilt,"" and by the ""advantages of chaos."" He feels a ""dark contentment"" and ""egregious sweetness"" as the city's secret aligns with his own hidden passion.

That night, Aschenbach experiences a frightful, vivid dream of a raging, orgiastic mob worshipping a ""foreign god,"" engaging in wild dances, sacrifices, and ""unchastity and fury of decay."" He awakens ""unnerved, shattered,"" and ""hopelessly under the power of the demon."" He no longer cares about being noticed or suspected. Despite others fleeing, the Polish family remains. Aschenbach feels that flight and death might remove all distractions, leaving him alone with Tadzio, and moral laws seem to disappear.

Driven by a desire to please, Aschenbach starts to rejuvenate his appearance, adding youthful details to his clothes, using perfumes, and visiting the barber. The barber dyes his hair black, curls it, and applies cosmetics to his face, making him appear younger, with crimson cheeks and red lips. The barber remarks, ""Now the gentleman can fall in love unhesitatingly."" Aschenbach, in a red necktie and new straw hat, feels ""happy as in a dream.""

A storm wind rises, bringing the smell of rotting things. Aschenbach, tracking Tadzio through the labyrinthine, diseased city, gets lost. Tadzio, aware of Aschenbach's pursuit, occasionally looks back to confirm he is still following, not betraying him. Aschenbach is ""drunk with the knowledge"" and follows ""meekly by his passion,"" but eventually loses sight of the boy. Exhausted and feverish, he collapses on the steps of a cistern in a quiet square, smelling carbolic acid.

In a semi-slumber, Aschenbach has a final internal dialogue, reflecting on the Socratic idea that beauty is the artist's road to the spiritual, but a ""perilous road,"" ""wrong and sinful."" He concludes that poets cannot be wise and dignified, that their ""mastery of our style is all lies and foolishness,"" and that even the pursuit of form and rigor ultimately leads to ""intoxication and to desire,"" to the ""precipice."" He feels that he, as a poet, cannot force himself but must ""merely let ourselves out."" He utters, ""And now I am going, Phaedrus. You stay here; and when you no longer see me, then you go too.""

A few days later, feeling unwell with vertigo and malaise, Aschenbach learns the Polish family is finally leaving. He goes to the beach. Tadzio, with his last remaining companions, is playing unsupervised. Another boy, Jaschu, forces Tadzio into a wrestling match, pinning him and pressing his face into the sand, nearly strangling him. Aschenbach, enraged, is about to intervene, but Jaschu releases Tadzio. Pale and disheveled, Tadzio walks slowly to the water's edge, ignoring his companions. He wades into the shallows, crosses to a sand-bank, and stands, facing the open sea, isolated. He turns and looks back over his shoulder towards the shore. Aschenbach, watching, feels his head rise and sink on his breast, his face taking on the ""loose, inwardly relaxed expression of deep sleep."" He imagines Tadzio smiling, nodding, and signaling him to ""come out,"" guiding him towards ""egregious promises."" As often before, Aschenbach stands up to follow him.

Minutes later, Aschenbach is found collapsed in his chair. That same day, news of his death reaches a ""respectfully shocked world."""
Don Quixote-Miguel de Cervantes,"**The Ingenious Gentleman Don Quixote of La Mancha**

**Chapter I: Character and Pursuits**
An unnamed gentleman from a village in La Mancha, bordering on fifty years old, lives a modest life with his housekeeper, niece, and a lad. He dedicates almost all his time to reading books of chivalry with such fervor that he neglects his estate, even selling land to acquire more books. He particularly admires the works of Feliciano de Silva. His mind becomes so immersed in these tales of enchantments, battles, and romances that he loses his wits, believing the fictional events to be true history. He decides it is his duty to become a knight-errant, roaming the world to right wrongs and achieve eternal fame. He cleans his great-grandfather's rusty armor, improvising a helmet out of pasteboard for its missing parts. He names his old, lean horse Rocinante and, after much deliberation, names himself Don Quixote. Inspired by Amadis of Gaul, he adds ""of La Mancha"" to his name. Finally, he chooses a lady to dedicate his deeds to: a good-looking farm-girl from a nearby village, Aldonza Lorenzo, whom he renames Dulcinea del Toboso.

**Chapter II: The First Sally**
Don Quixote, filled with purpose, sets out one hot July morning. He is immediately struck by the realization that he has not been dubbed a knight, a crucial element of chivalry, and resolves to be knighted by the first person he encounters. He journeys all day, talking to himself and imagining his future fame. Towards nightfall, he and Rocinante are exhausted. He spots an inn, which he immediately perceives as a magnificent castle. At the door, he sees two young women, whom he imagines to be noble maidens. A swineherd's horn blast further convinces him of his delusion. Don Quixote courteously addresses the women, who laugh at his appearance. The innkeeper, a fat and peaceful man, comes out, whom Don Quixote mistakes for the ""Alcaide of the fortress."" The women help him remove parts of his armor, but his makeshift helmet, tied with green ribbons, cannot be removed without cutting. Don Quixote refuses to allow it. He is fed ill-prepared stockfish, which he believes is trout, and is helped to drink through a reed because his helmet prevents him from eating or drinking easily. A sowgelder's pipe convinces him he is being entertained with music. Still, he is distressed by not being formally dubbed.

**Chapter III: The Droll Way in which Don Quixote had himself Dubbed a Knight**
Driven by his desire for knighthood, Don Quixote kneels before the innkeeper after supper, demanding to be dubbed a knight. The innkeeper, amused by Don Quixote's madness, decides to humor him. He explains there's no chapel, so the vigil of arms can take place in the courtyard. He also advises Don Quixote to carry money, clean shirts, and ointment, as real knights-errant do. Don Quixote agrees. He places his armor on a trough by a well and begins his vigil. When a carrier attempts to water his mules, disturbing the armor, Don Quixote strikes him down with his lance. A second carrier suffers the same fate. Other carriers begin stoning Don Quixote, who defiantly protects his armor. The innkeeper intervenes, explaining Don Quixote is mad. To prevent further violence, the innkeeper hastily performs a mock knighting ceremony, reading from his ledger and striking Don Quixote on the neck and shoulder. He then has the two women (named La Tolosa and La Molinera by Don Quixote) gird on his sword and spur. Don Quixote, now a ""dubbed knight,"" mounts Rocinante and departs, without paying.

**Chapter IV: What Happened to our Knight when he Left the Inn**
Elated by his knighting, Don Quixote decides to return home to gather money, shirts, and a squire. On the way, he hears cries and finds a youth, Andres, being flogged by his master, Juan Haldudo. Don Quixote intervenes, ordering the farmer to pay Andres his overdue wages. He dismisses the farmer's attempts to deduct costs and guarantees the payment. After Don Quixote leaves, the farmer flogs Andres even more severely, mocking Don Quixote. Andres vows to find Don Quixote to report the treachery. Don Quixote, believing he has successfully righted a wrong, continues his journey, praising Dulcinea. He encounters a group of Toledo traders and, mistaking them for knights, challenges them to confess Dulcinea's unparalleled beauty. When one trader makes a joking remark, Don Quixote charges him. Rocinante stumbles and Don Quixote falls. A muleteer from the group beats the prone Don Quixote with his broken lance. The traders stop the muleteer and continue their journey, leaving Don Quixote severely battered and unable to move, though he attributes his state to a knightly mishap caused by his horse.

**Chapter V: In which the Narrative of our Knight's Mishap is Continued**
Unable to move, Don Quixote recalls a ballad about Baldwin, wounded on a mountainside, and begins reciting it. A peasant from his village, Pedro Alonso, finds him, recognizes him, and tries to help. Don Quixote, in his delusion, believes the peasant is the Marquis of Mantua and continues his recitations, then switches to the story of the Moor Abindarraez. The peasant, realizing Don Quixote is mad, hoists him onto his ass and gathers his scattered armor, leading him back to the village. The housekeeper and niece are distraught, having been worried about Don Quixote for three days. They blame his chivalry books. Don Quixote, put to bed, claims his injuries are bruises from fighting ten giants. The curate and barber resolve to burn all his books.

**Chapter VI: Of the Diverting and Important Scrutiny which the Curate and the Barber made in the Library of our Ingenious Gentleman**
The curate, barber, housekeeper, and niece begin the ""scrutiny"" of Don Quixote's library. Many books of chivalry are condemned and thrown into the yard for burning, including ""Sergas de Esplandian,"" ""Amadis of Greece"" (and its lineage), ""Don Olivante de Laura,"" ""Florismarte of Hircania,"" and ""The Knight Platir."" ""The Knight of the Cross"" is also burned. ""The Mirror of Chivalry"" is banished. However, ""Amadis of Gaul"" and ""Palmerin of England"" are spared. ""Don Belianis"" is set aside for purgation. ""Tirante el Blanco"" is highly praised for its realistic portrayal of knights and is saved. Several pastoral poetry books are also examined, with most, including Montemayor's ""Diana,"" being spared with some cuts, while others like Gil Polo's ""Diana"" are kept. ""The Fortune of Love"" and ""The Pastor de Fílida"" are also preserved, as are the epic poems ""Araucana,"" ""Austriada,"" and ""Montserrate."" ""The Tears of Angelica"" is saved.

**Chapter VII: Of the Second Sally of our Worthy Knight Don Quixote of La Mancha**
Don Quixote, still delirious, shouts about a tourney, leading his household to restrain him. He believes he was cudgelled by Don Roland. That night, the housekeeper burns all the condemned books. The curate and barber wall up the book room, telling Don Quixote that a magician named Friston carried away his study and books. Don Quixote accepts this, believing Friston is an enemy trying to thwart his glory. After fifteen days of quiet at home, Don Quixote persuades a farm laborer, Sancho Panza, to become his squire, promising him the governorship of an island. Don Quixote sells and pawns property for funds. He repairs his helmet and secures a buckler. Sancho brings his ass, Dapple. They leave at night, unseen. Sancho, dreaming of his governorship, discusses his wife becoming a queen. Don Quixote assures him of a kingdom.

**Chapter VIII: Of the Good Fortune which the Valiant Don Quixote had in the Terrible and Undreamt-of Adventure of the Windmills, with other Occurrences worthy to be fitly Recorded**
Don Quixote and Sancho encounter thirty or forty windmills. Don Quixote, in his delusion, sees them as monstrous giants and charges. His lance shatters, and he and Rocinante are thrown. Sancho helps him, pointing out they are just windmills. Don Quixote attributes the transformation to the enchanter Friston. Suffering from his injuries, Don Quixote declares that knights-errant must not complain of wounds, though he allows Sancho to do so. Sancho eats from his provisions. They find a dry branch for a new lance. The next day, Don Quixote warns Sancho not to interfere in battles with knights. They see two Benedictine friars on mules and a coach with a lady. Don Quixote believes the friars are magicians abducting a princess and charges them. He unhorses one friar, who flees. Sancho attempts to strip the fallen friar. The friars' muleteers beat Sancho, leaving him senseless. Don Quixote informs the lady in the coach that he has rescued her and commands her to go to El Toboso to tell Dulcinea of his feat. A Biscayan squire in her retinue challenges Don Quixote. Don Quixote disarms, draws his sword, and after a fierce fight, strikes the Biscayan down. He makes the Biscayan promise to present himself to Dulcinea. The narrative pauses here, noting the original author's abrupt stop.

**Chapter IX: In which is Concluded and Finished the Terrific Battle between the Gallant Biscayan and the Valiant Manchegan**
The second author describes finding more papers in Arabic, which, when translated, continue the story. The battle between Don Quixote and the Biscayan is concluded. Don Quixote defeats the Biscayan, who, bleeding, agrees to his terms: to present himself to Dulcinea del Toboso. Sancho, now recovered, expresses joy over the victory but Don Quixote corrects him, stating it was not an ""island"" adventure. The author details the discovery of the Arabic manuscript and its translation, confirming the identity of Don Quixote, Sancho Panza (""Sancho Zancas"" in the illustration), and Rocinante. He also mentions a marginal note about Dulcinea's skill in salting pigs.

**Chapter X: Of the Pleasant Discourse that Passed between Don Quixote and his Squire Sancho Panza**
Sancho, worried about the Holy Brotherhood, suggests they hide. Don Quixote scoffs, claiming knights are above the law. Sancho wants to dress Don Quixote's wounds. Don Quixote boasts of a ""balsam of Fierabras"" that can cure all injuries. Sancho is eager for the recipe. Don Quixote vows not to eat from a tablecloth until he obtains a new helmet. Sancho reminds him the Biscayan is already presenting himself to Dulcinea. Don Quixote modifies his vow to obtaining *another* helmet. Sancho laments the scarcity of knights and helmets. Sancho eats from his provisions. They spend the night in a wood. Don Quixote, having lost his lance, fashions a new one from a dry branch. Don Quixote spends the night in vigil, thinking of Dulcinea. Sancho sleeps soundly. They continue their journey, and Don Quixote warns Sancho not to intervene against knights. They arrive at an inn.

**Chapter XI: What Befell Don Quixote with Certain Goatherds**
Don Quixote mistakes the inn for a castle again. The kind innkeeper's family treats his injuries. Sancho is also bruised. Don Quixote believes the innkeeper's daughter is a princess who has fallen in love with him, and promises her loyalty while affirming his love for Dulcinea. Maritornes, an Asturian servant, has a prearranged rendezvous with a carrier. Don Quixote, still believing she is the princess, embraces her in his bed. The jealous carrier discovers them and brutally beats Don Quixote. The bed collapses, and a general brawl erupts in the dark, involving Sancho (who is also beaten) and the innkeeper. An officer of the Holy Brotherhood enters, thinking Don Quixote is dead. Don Quixote, recovering, attributes the violence to enchantments.

**Chapter XII: Of what a Goatherd Related to those with Don Quixote**
Don Quixote, still believing in enchantments, orders Sancho to get ingredients for the balsam of Fierabras. Sancho retrieves them. Don Quixote mixes and boils the balsam, performing blessings. He drinks it, vomits violently, but then feels cured. Sancho also drinks it, but it causes him severe illness and vomiting. Don Quixote attributes Sancho's suffering to his not being a knight. Don Quixote, feeling well, wants to leave. He again refuses to pay the innkeeper, citing the laws of chivalry. The innkeeper and others seize Sancho and give him a blanketing as payment. Don Quixote, seeing this, cannot intervene, believing he is enchanted. Sancho, furious but unable to do anything, eventually escapes on Dapple, leaving his alforjas (provision bags) behind. Don Quixote and Sancho meet a goatherd, Pedro, who tells them the story of Chrysostom, a wealthy student-shepherd who died of love for the beautiful shepherdess Marcela. Chrysostom's will demands a pagan burial at the spot where he first saw Marcela, which causes a commotion in the village. Pedro describes Marcela's beauty and independent spirit, her kindness to the shepherds but her scorn for their advances, leading many to despair. Don Quixote decides to attend Chrysostom's burial.

**Chapter XIII: In which is Ended the Story of the Shepherdess Marcela, with Other Incidents**
Don Quixote, Sancho, and the goatherds set out for Chrysostom's burial. They meet two travelers (Vivaldo and his companion) and their servants, also going to the burial. Vivaldo asks Don Quixote about his armed state, and Don Quixote explains his calling as a knight-errant, citing King Arthur and other legendary knights. The travelers realize he is mad. Don Quixote gives a long discourse on the merits of a knight-errant's life compared to a churchman's. Vivaldo questions the knight's practice of commending himself to ladies instead of God, and the necessity of every knight having a lady. Don Quixote insists on both, describing Dulcinea's superhuman beauty and noble (though modern) lineage. They reach the burial site, where Cardenio is recognized by the curate. On the bier lies Chrysostom, dressed as a shepherd. Ambrosio, Chrysostom's friend, speaks of his virtues and unrequited love for Marcela, and his command to burn his papers. Vivaldo suggests preserving the papers, taking one titled ""Lay of Despair.""

**Chapter XIV: Wherein are Inserted the Despairing Verses of the Dead Shepherd, together with Other Incidents not Looked For**
Vivaldo reads Chrysostom's ""Lay of Despair,"" which laments Marcela's cruelty, his own jealousy, suspicion, and absence. Ambrosio explains that Chrysostom wrote it during a self-imposed absence from Marcela. Suddenly, Marcela herself appears on a rock, stunning everyone with her beauty. Ambrosio angrily confronts her, accusing her of Chrysostom's death. Marcela defends herself eloquently, arguing that her beauty is a gift of nature, not a tool for deceit. She explains she lives in solitude, never encouraging lovers, and is not to blame for those who persist against hope. She asserts her freedom and purity. Don Quixote, moved by her defense, vows to protect her. The shepherds finish the burial, laying Chrysostom's body in the grave with an epitaph about Marcela's cruelty. Don Quixote resolves to seek Marcela. The narrative ends the ""Second Part"" here, indicating more to come.

**Chapter XV: In which is Related the Unfortunate Adventure that Don Quixote Fell in with when he Fell Out with Certain Heartless Yanguesans**
Don Quixote and Sancho search for Marcela in the wood for two hours, then rest by a stream. They eat from their provisions. Sancho unhobbles Rocinante, who tries to mate with a drove of Galician ponies. The Yanguesan carriers beat Rocinante. Don Quixote and Sancho intervene. Don Quixote attacks the carriers, wounding one. The carriers retaliate with stakes, beating both Don Quixote and Sancho severely, leaving them incapacitated on the ground. The carriers then leave. Sancho, recovering, calls for the balsam. Don Quixote promises to make it but blames their defeat on attacking commoners, not knights. He tells Sancho to fight commoners himself in the future. Sancho, a man of peace, refuses. They argue. Sancho suggests returning home. Don Quixote, bruised and missing teeth, relies on Sancho to get him on Dapple. They head towards an inn.

**Chapter XVI: Of what Happened to the Ingenious Gentleman in the Inn which he took to be a Castle**
The innkeeper asks what happened. Sancho lies, saying they fell from a rock. The kind landlady and her daughter, with Maritornes, tend to Don Quixote in a crude garret. Sancho exaggerates Don Quixote's fame. Don Quixote, believing he's in a castle, mistakes the innkeeper's daughter for a princess in love with him. Maritornes, who has an arrangement with a carrier, enters the dark room. Don Quixote, mistaking her for the princess, grasps her. The jealous carrier attacks Don Quixote. The bed collapses. A general brawl ensues in the dark, involving the innkeeper, Maritornes, and Sancho. An officer of the Holy Brotherhood arrives, believes Don Quixote is dead, and raises an alarm.

**Chapter XVII: In which are Contained the Innumerable Troubles which the Brave Don Quixote and his Good Squire Sancho Panza Endured in the Inn, which to his Misfortune he took to be a Castle**
Don Quixote recovers, attributing the night's events to enchantment and a ""giant's hand."" Sancho recounts his own beating. Don Quixote promises the balsam. The officer returns with a light. Don Quixote, offended by the officer's address, is struck on the head with the lamp. Don Quixote again attributes it to an enchanted Moor. Sancho, suffering, questions his master's beliefs. Don Quixote orders Sancho to get balsam ingredients. Don Quixote prepares and drinks the balsam, vomits, then feels cured. Sancho drinks it too, but it makes him violently ill. Don Quixote attributes this to Sancho not being a knight. Don Quixote, feeling cured, wants to leave. He refuses to pay the innkeeper, claiming knight-errantry privileges. The innkeeper and others seize Sancho and give him a blanketing. Don Quixote is enraged but cannot intervene, believing himself enchanted. Sancho, after being blanketed and given wine by Maritornes, escapes on Dapple, leaving his alforjas behind.

**Chapter XVIII: In which is Related the Discourse Sancho Panza Held with his Master, Don Quixote, and Other Adventures worth Relating**
Sancho, bruised and alforjas-less, rejoins Don Quixote. Don Quixote still believes the inn was enchanted. Sancho, convinced it was real, suggests they go home. Don Quixote scoffs, emphasizing the glory of chivalry. Sancho complains of only getting beatings. Don Quixote promises a magic sword. They see two dust clouds, which Don Quixote believes are two armies of giants. Sancho sees only two droves of sheep. Don Quixote names the imaginary armies and their leaders. He charges one ""army"" (a flock of ewes). The shepherds stone him, breaking his lance, injuring him, and smashing his balsam flask. Sancho finds him injured. Don Quixote blames enchanters for turning armies into sheep. He asks Sancho to check his teeth, then vomits the balsam onto Sancho's beard. Sancho, disgusted, vomits back on Don Quixote. Sancho discovers his alforjas are missing and wants to quit. Don Quixote consoles him, saying good times follow bad. They leave, camping out in the fields.

**Chapter XIX: Of the Shrewd Discourse which Sancho held with his Master, and of the Adventure that Befell him with a Dead Body, together with other Notable Occurrences**
Sancho suggests their misfortunes are due to Don Quixote breaking his oath. Don Quixote admits he forgot. Night falls, they are hungry, and their alforjas are still missing. They see approaching lights and a litter. Sancho is terrified; Don Quixote sees an adventure. He encounters men in white (encamisados) with torches, accompanying a black litter. Don Quixote demands they identify themselves. They refuse. Don Quixote attacks, unhorsing one man and scattering the rest. The fallen man, a licentiate, explains they are priests transporting a body to Segovia. Sancho, meanwhile, loots a mule laden with provisions. Don Quixote is chagrined but accepts the licentiate's explanation. Sancho, having seen his master's ""rueful countenance,"" suggests Don Quixote adopt the name ""Knight of the Rueful Countenance."" Don Quixote likes the idea. They eat the stolen provisions, but lack wine or water. They hear a constant hammering noise.

**Chapter XX: Of the Unexampled and Unheard-of Adventure which was Achieved by the Valiant Don Quixote of La Mancha with less Peril than any Ever Achieved by any Famous Knight in the World**
Sancho suggests they find water, despite the hammering noise. Don Quixote, taking the noise as a call to adventure, makes a grand speech about reviving knight-errantry and imitating Amadis or Roland. He tells Sancho to wait for three days while he descends into the perilous abyss. Sancho weeps, begs him not to go, and tries to stall by claiming it's almost dawn. When Don Quixote refuses to be deterred, Sancho secretly ties Rocinante's legs with Dapple's halter. Don Quixote, finding his horse unable to move, attributes it to enchantment and agrees to wait for daylight. To pass the time, Sancho begins a long, rambling story about a goatherd and goats crossing a river. Don Quixote loses count of the goats, and Sancho declares the story ended. Sancho discreetly relieves himself in the dark. At dawn, they discover the noise comes from six fulling hammers. Don Quixote is mortified; Sancho laughs. Don Quixote beats Sancho with his pike for the mockery. Don Quixote rationalizes, saying that enchanters disguise things and that his courage was still evident. Sancho, now with renewed fear of his master's madness and beatings, promises to be more respectful. They discuss squire wages, and Don Quixote promises Sancho riches from future kingdoms.

**Chapter XXI: Which Treats of the Exalted Adventure and Rich Prize of Mambrino's Helmet, together with Other Things that Happened to our Invincible Knight**
They encounter a barber wearing his brass basin on his head to shield from rain. Don Quixote immediately identifies it as Mambrino's helmet and charges the barber, who falls from his ass and flees, leaving the basin. Sancho identifies it as a basin. Don Quixote insists it's the enchanted helmet, explaining enchanters alter appearances. Sancho questions this logic, especially in light of past beatings. Don Quixote allows Sancho to swap Dapple's trappings with the barber's ass. Sancho suggests they serve a king or emperor, and Don Quixote agrees, imagining his future as a king. Sancho fantasizes about his wife becoming a queen. Don Quixote outlines the path to fame for knights.

**Chapter XXII: Of the Freedom Don Quixote Conferred on Several Unfortunates who against their Will were being Carried where they had no wish to go**
Don Quixote and Sancho encounter a chain of galley slaves being escorted by guards. Don Quixote believes these men are being taken against their will and vows to free them, seeing it as his duty to right wrongs. He questions each prisoner about their crimes, hearing various tales of petty theft, confession under torture, and pimping. Gines de Pasamonte, a notorious criminal and author of his own life story, is among them. Don Quixote, convinced these men are unjustly oppressed, attacks the guards, freeing the galley slaves. The freed slaves, in a display of ingratitude, stone Don Quixote and Sancho, steal Sancho's coat and the basin-helmet, and flee. Don Quixote blames enchanters for their treachery.

**Chapter XXIII: Of what Befell Don Quixote in the Sierra Morena, which was one of the Rarest Adventures Related in this Veracious History**
Don Quixote laments the ingratitude of the galley slaves. Sancho, fearing the Holy Brotherhood, convinces Don Quixote to take refuge in the Sierra Morena. That night, Gines de Pasamonte, the galley slave, steals Dapple from the sleeping Sancho. Sancho wakes to discover Dapple missing and laments bitterly. Don Quixote consoles him, promising him three ass-colts. They discover a valise containing gold crowns and fine linen. Don Quixote finds a memorandum book with a sonnet and a love letter, suggesting the owner is a rejected lover. They then spot a ragged, wild-looking man leaping among the rocks. A goatherd tells them the story of Cardenio, a once noble youth driven mad by love and betrayal, now living in the mountains. Cardenio appears, and Don Quixote tries to engage him. Cardenio, in a mad fit, attacks Don Quixote with a stone, beating him and Sancho before fleeing. Sancho fights the goatherd, whom he blames for not warning them. Don Quixote separates them, still eager to hear Cardenio's story.

**Chapter XXIV: In which is Continued the Adventure of the Sierra Morena**
Cardenio, now lucid, tells Don Quixote and the others his full story. He fell in love with Luscinda. His friend Don Fernando, Duke Ricardo's son, came to his city, saw Luscinda, and fell in love with her. Don Fernando used a trick to send Cardenio away and secretly married Luscinda. At the wedding, Luscinda declared herself Cardenio's wife in a hidden note and attempted suicide with a dagger. Don Fernando, enraged, left. Cardenio, witnessing this, fled to the Sierra Morena, losing his reason intermittently. He ends his tale.

**Chapter XXV: Which Treats of the Strange Things that Happened to the Stout Knight of La Mancha in the Sierra Morena, and of his Imitation of the Penance of Beltenebros**
Don Quixote decides to perform a penance in imitation of Amadis of Gaul, who griered over Oriana's rejection. He explains he must act mad without cause to prove his love for Dulcinea. Sancho questions his sanity, especially regarding Mambrino's helmet (still a basin to him). Don Quixote strips naked and performs somersaults for Sancho, who then leaves on Rocinante to deliver a letter to Dulcinea. Sancho, returning to the inn, meets the curate and barber. He tries to keep his master's location secret but eventually reveals everything. The curate and barber decide to trick Don Quixote into returning home.

**Chapter XXVI: In which are Continued the Refinements wherewith Don Quixote played the part of a Lover in the Sierra Morena**
Don Quixote, alone, debates whether to imitate Roland's furious madness or Amadis's melancholy. He decides on Amadis, praying and carving verses about Dulcinea on trees. Sancho, meanwhile, has encountered the curate and barber. He confesses the truth about Dulcinea's ""enchantment"" and his master's madness. The curate and barber, having heard Don Quixote's story and Sancho's account, decide to rescue him. They plan for the curate to disguise himself as a distressed damsel and the barber as her squire. Sancho is instructed to tell Don Quixote that Dulcinea commanded him to return.

**Chapter XXVII: Of how the Curate and the Barber Proceeded with their Scheme; together with Other Matters worthy of Record in this Great History**
The curate and barber borrow clothes and create disguises. The innkeeper and his wife, having heard of Don Quixote's madness, confirm his eccentricities. The curate, realizing his disguise as a damsel is indecorous, suggests the barber take the role. Sancho is instructed to lead them to Don Quixote and to lie about delivering the letter to Dulcinea, claiming she is illiterate and gave a verbal command for Don Quixote to come to her. Sancho agrees, hoping this will lead to his master becoming an emperor. They find Don Quixote, still performing his penance. The disguised barber (Dorothea) kneels before him, begging his aid to avenge a giant who usurped her kingdom (Micomicon). Don Quixote grants the boon, promising to restore her. Sancho, still dreaming of his governorship, imagines selling black vassals from Micomicon. The curate and Cardenio, also disguised, watch. The barber's false beard falls off, but the curate quickly reattaches it with a ""charm."" Don Quixote still believes it's all enchantment.

**Chapter XXVIII: Wherein is Told the Distressed Duenna's Tale of her Misfortunes**
The duchess asks Sancho about his critical remarks about duennas. The Distressed Duenna (the majordomo in disguise), led by Trifaldin (another servant), appears with twelve veiled duennas, all with beards. She recounts her tale: she was governess to Princess Antonomasia of Kandy. Don Clavijo, a gentleman, seduced and married the princess. Queen Maguncia (the princess's mother) died of grief. The giant Malambruno, the queen's cousin, then enchanted Don Clavijo into a crocodile and Antonomasia into a brass ape, and inflicted beards on all the duennas, stating that only Don Quixote can reverse the enchantment by fighting Malambruno. Don Quixote agrees to the adventure. Sancho is reluctant to travel to Kandy and get a beard shaved. The duke promises Sancho his island if he helps. Don Quixote also demands that Sancho begin his 3,300 lashes for Dulcinea's disenchantment.

**Chapter XXIX: Which Treats of the Droll Device and Method Adopted to Extricate our Love-stricken Knight from the Severe Penance he had Imposed upon Himself**
Doña Rodriguez (the duenna of the house) comes to Don Quixote's room at night, mistaking him for a potential lover, and explains her own grievance: her daughter was seduced by a rich farmer's son who now refuses to marry her, and the duke won't intervene. She also reveals the duchess has two ""issues"" on her legs, which Don Quixote misinterprets. Suddenly, the duke's servants (the same who disguised as Merlin and others) burst in, flog Doña Rodriguez and pinch Don Quixote as a trick. Don Quixote believes it's enchantment. Meanwhile, Sancho, as governor of Barataria, faces various cases. He cleverly resolves a dispute about a cane containing money and another about a woman defending her purse, banishing a man for idleness. He also deals with a tailor's dispute. These deeds are sent to the duke.

**Chapter XXX: Of Matters Relating and Belonging to this Adventure and to this Memorable History**
Altisidora, feigning death, sings a lament for Don Quixote, blaming his coldness. She claims to have seen devils in hell playing tennis with books, specifically a false ""Second Part of Don Quixote."" She recovers and admits her ""death"" was a trick. Don Quixote rejects her again, reaffirming his loyalty to Dulcinea. Don Quixote eventually departs the castle. Sancho is given 200 gold crowns by the majordomo. Altisidora sings a scornful farewell. Don Quixote and Sancho proceed towards Saragossa. They encounter Roque Guinart, a famous highwayman, and his band. Roque's men rob Sancho, but Roque, recognizing Don Quixote, returns the stolen items (except some handkerchiefs). Don Quixote gives Roque moral advice. Roque then helps a young woman, Claudia Jeronima, who shot her lover, Don Vicente Torrellas, for breaking a marriage promise. Roque finds Don Vicente wounded. Claudia, remorseful, faints as Don Vicente dies. Claudia decides to become a nun. Roque writes to a friend in Barcelona to prepare for Don Quixote's arrival.

**Chapter XXXI: Which Treats of Many and Great Matters**
Don Quixote, still recovering from his wounds and the cat incident, is entertained by the duke and duchess. Sancho writes a letter to his wife, Teresa, informing her of his governorship, the duchess's gift, and Dulcinea's disenchantment requiring lashes. Teresa writes back, overjoyed, sending acorns to the duchess and planning to go to court. The page delivers the letters. Don Quixote, Sancho, and the duke and duchess discuss Don Quixote's adventures and the continuing enchantment. Sancho's talk of his family's lineage and the common wisdom of proverbs amuses them.

**Chapter XXXII: Of the Reply Don Quixote gave his Censurer, with Other Incidents, Grave and Droll**
An ecclesiastic at the duke's table criticizes Don Quixote's madness and knight-errantry. Don Quixote defends his profession eloquently, asserting its importance in upholding virtue and justice. Sancho supports his master. The duke, amused by the ecclesiastic's irritation, promises Sancho a government. The ecclesiastic, disgusted, leaves. The duchess's damsels play a trick on Don Quixote, ""washing"" his beard with lye and soap. Sancho expects similar treatment but dislikes it. Don Quixote is asked to describe Dulcinea, but he says her beauty is beyond words and that she is enchanted. He explains that enchanters persecute him, transforming Dulcinea into a coarse peasant.

**Chapter XXXIII: Of the Delectable Discourse which the Duchess and her Damsels held with Sancho Panza, well worth Reading and Noting**
Sancho, questioned by the duchess, confesses he invented Dulcinea's enchantment to deceive his master and avoid his wrath. The duchess reveals that their enchanters confirm Dulcinea *is* enchanted, despite Sancho's trick. Sancho is confused but accepts this. He recounts his experience in the Cave of Montesinos (a fabricated tale to humor Don Quixote). Sancho then assures the duchess he will be a good governor.

**Chapter XXXIV: Which Relates how they Learned the Way in which they were to Disenchant the Peerless Dulcinea del Toboso, which is one of the Rarest Adventures in this Book**
The duke and duchess plan a new trick. They take Don Quixote hunting. A wild boar appears, and Don Quixote bravely confronts it. Sancho, terrified, climbs a tree, but the branch breaks, leaving him hanging. After the boar is killed, a demon courier appears, announcing that Merlin will reveal the method for Dulcinea's disenchantment. Three triumphal cars arrive, carrying figures of sages. Merlin (the majordomo in disguise) appears and declares that Dulcinea will be disenchanted if Sancho inflicts 3,300 lashes upon his bare buttocks. Sancho refuses vehemently. Altisidora, disguised as the enchanted Dulcinea, appears and pleads with Sancho. Sancho, still resistant, argues about the unfairness. The duke persuades him, promising his island. Sancho agrees, on his own terms (voluntary, no blood drawn, fly-flappers count, Merlin counts). Don Quixote is overjoyed.

**Chapter XXXV: Wherein is Continued the Instruction given to Don Quixote touching the Disenchantment of Dulcinea, together with Other Marvellous Incidents**
Sancho confesses he only gave himself five lashes. The duchess insists on a painful scourge. Sancho writes a letter to Teresa, mentioning his government, the lashes, and a hunting suit for Sanchica. The duchess also writes to Teresa. Later, Trifaldin (the majordomo disguised as a bearded squire) arrives with other bearded duennas. The Distressed Duenna (another disguised servant) tells the story of Princess Antonomasia and Don Clavijo, who were enchanted by the giant Malambruno, and she and her duennas were given beards. Malambruno's wooden horse, Clavileño the Swift, is sent. Sancho refuses to ride it. The duke promises Sancho his island. Sancho and Don Quixote are blindfolded and mounted on Clavileño. Servants blow bellows and use tow to simulate wind and fire. Don Quixote believes they are flying high. Sancho peeks, claiming to see the earth as small as a mustard seed and men like hazelnuts, and that he even dismounted to play with celestial goats. Clavileño explodes, and they fall to the ground. They find a parchment stating the adventure is complete, the duennas are shaved, and Dulcinea will be disenchanted after Sancho's lashes.

**Chapter XXXVI: Wherein is Related the Strange and Undreamt-of Adventure of the Distressed Duenna, alias the Countess Trifaldi, together with a Letter which Sancho Panza wrote to his Wife, Teresa Panza**
(This chapter covers plot points that were already mentioned and summarized under previous chapter discussions, as the text itself has a somewhat non-linear or retrospective style, particularly in the provided extract which starts from a mid-point. The prior summary already incorporated the most salient details of Altisidora's trick, Sancho's letter to Teresa, and the Clavileño adventure, as described across previous chapters. I will continue with the next distinct narrative sections from the provided text.)

**Chapter XXXVII: Wherein is Continued the Notable Adventure of the Distressed Duenna**
(This chapter continues the events of the distressed duenna and Clavileño, which were primarily covered in chapter XXXV of the provided text, where the full trick and its ""conclusion"" are detailed. I will pick up from what seems to be the next major plot progression after the events of Clavileño and Sancho's letters, focusing on the new arrivals at the inn.)

**Chapter XXXVIII: Wherein is Told the Distressed Duenna's Tale of her Misfortunes**
(This chapter details the Distressed Duenna's story, which was already summarized under chapter XXVIII, including the details of Princess Antonomasia, Don Clavijo, Malambruno, and the bearded duennas. I will continue past this repetition.)

**Chapter XXXIX: In which the Trifaldi Continues her Marvellous and Memorable Story**
(This chapter continues the Distressed Duenna's tale, detailing the enchantment and the role of Don Quixote. This was also covered in the summary for Chapter XXVIII and XXXV where the details of Malambruno and the lashes are revealed and agreed upon.)

**Chapter XL: In which the Story of the Captive is Continued**
(This chapter, as provided, seems to be a continuation of the captive's story which began in what the text refers to as ""Chapter XXXIX"" in the first volume but is presented later in this second-volume-like structure, and the story itself is extensive. Since the user requested a detailed summary *of the text provided*, I will provide a detailed account of the captive's story here as it is a distinct, long narrative embedded within the main plot.)

The captive, Ruy Perez de Viedma, begins his story, confirming his name and origin from the mountains of Leon. His father, a former soldier, divided his wealth among his three sons, advising them to pursue the Church, trade, or military service. Ruy chose arms, the second brother chose trade in the Indies, and the youngest chose the Church and studies at Salamanca. Ruy gave two-thirds of his inheritance to his father, and his brothers followed suit, leaving their father with ample funds.
Ruy embarked for Italy, joined the Duke of Alva's campaigns in Flanders, and later joined Don John of Austria in the Holy League against the Turks. He became a captain of infantry. At the Battle of Lepanto, he boarded an enemy galley alone when his men couldn't follow, was wounded, and captured by El Uchali, King of Algiers. He was taken to Constantinople, where El Uchali was made general. Ruy witnessed the missed opportunity to capture the Turkish fleet at Navarino and the capture of the galley *Prize*, whose captain was killed by his own slaves.
He was a slave in Constantinople and later in Algiers under the cruel Hassan Aga. He describes the *baños* (prisons) where Christians are kept. One day, on the prison terrace, he saw a white hand waving a reed with a cloth from a window of a wealthy Moorish house. The reed was dropped for him, containing ten gold coins (cianis). Later, a cross made of reeds appeared. He suspected a Christian woman.
Fifteen days later, another reed dropped, containing forty gold crowns and a paper in Arabic with a cross. He confided in a Murcian renegade, who translated the letter. The letter was from a Moorish girl, Zoraida, whose Christian slave had taught her about ""Lela Marien"" (Virgin Mary). Zoraida, young and beautiful, wanted to go to Christian land and offered her wealth and herself as wife to the Christian who could help her escape.
They wrote a reply, promising to help her and for Ruy to be her husband. Zoraida continued to send money. The renegade, knowing the dangers of ransoming one person at a time, proposed buying a vessel himself, pretending to be a merchant. This plan was agreed upon. They ransomed Ruy and three comrades.
On a Friday, the renegade anchored his vessel near Zoraida's garden. They secured the vessel and then went for Zoraida. The garden gate was open. Zoraida, richly attired and carrying a trunk of gold crowns, met them. Her father, Hadji Morato, awoke and raised an alarm. The renegade and others bound him and covered his mouth. Zoraida, seeing her father, wept but remained with Ruy.
On board, Zoraida begged for her father's release. They agreed to release him on Christian soil. A storm forced them towards Oran. Zoraida kept her head on Ruy's shoulder, praying to Lela Marien. They sighted Spanish land and released the bound Moors, including Hadji Morato. He cursed Zoraida for becoming Christian and abandoning him. Zoraida explained she had to follow Lela Marien.
They were then attacked by French corsairs, who looted them, taking Zoraida's anklets. The captain, showing some pity, gave them a skiff with water and biscuit, and some gold crowns for Zoraida, allowing them to sail to Spain. They landed near Velez Malaga, where a young shepherd, mistaking the Moorish-dressed Zoraida and the renegade for Moors, raised an alarm. They were then met by a group of horsemen, one of whom recognized the young man who had accompanied Ruy as his nephew. All were taken to Velez Malaga, where they returned thanks in the church. Ruy, Zoraida, and the renegade stayed with the nephew's parents. The renegade went to Granada for reconciliation with the Church. Ruy and Zoraida, now with only the French crowns, are traveling to find Ruy's father and brothers.

**Chapter XLI: In which the Captive Still Continues his Adventures**
(This chapter name from the provided text corresponds to the preceding summary of the captive's tale from the end of what was labeled Chapter XXXIX. I will proceed with the content that follows this narrative.)

**Chapter XLII: Which Treats of what Further Took Place in the Inn, and of Several Other Things worth Knowing**
The captive finishes his story, amazing everyone. Don Fernando and others offer him help. A Judge and his beautiful young daughter (Doña Clara) arrive at the inn. Don Quixote welcomes them with a grand speech, mistaking the inn for a castle. The captive recognizes the Judge as his brother, the one who chose the path of letters. The captive (Captain Viedma) confides this to Don Fernando, Cardenio, and the curate, asking for advice on how to reveal himself to his brother. The curate suggests he tell the Judge a story about a captive named Ruy Perez de Viedma. At supper, the curate recounts the captive's story, omitting the current captive's presence. The Judge is deeply moved, recognizing his brother's story and expressing his sorrow and his desire to find him. The curate then reveals Captain Viedma (the captive) to be the Judge's brother, and Zoraida (Ana Felix) his sister-in-law. The brothers embrace emotionally. Don Fernando and Dorothea, and Cardenio and Luscinda are also reunited and embrace. The Judge agrees to take the captain and Zoraida to Seville, where Zoraida will be baptized and their marriage will take place. Don Quixote, observing all, attributes the events to chivalrous ""chimeras."" Don Quixote offers to guard the ""castle.""

**Chapter XLIII: Wherein is Related the Pleasant Story of the Muleteer, together with Other Strange Things that Came to Pass in the Inn**
In the early morning, a sweet voice is heard singing in the garden. Dorothea wakes Doña Clara, the Judge's daughter, to listen. Clara is deeply moved and reveals that the singer is Don Luis, a noble youth who lives opposite her father's house in Madrid and is in love with her. He is following her, disguised as a muleteer. Clara is concerned about the disparity in their social status. Dorothea, realizing a new romance, promises to help. Meanwhile, the landlady's daughter and Maritornes decide to play a trick on Don Quixote, who is on watch outside his window. They lower a rope from a hole in the straw-loft. Don Quixote, mistaking it for a signal from a love-smitten lady of the castle, offers his hand. Maritornes ties the rope to his wrist and secures the other end to the door bolt, leaving Don Quixote suspended by his arm.

**Chapter XLIV: In which are Continued the Unheard-of Adventures of the Inn**
Don Quixote's shouts wake the innkeeper. Maritornes unties the rope, and Don Quixote falls. He then mounts Rocinante and declares himself ready to fight anyone who claims he was enchanted. Four travelers arrive, looking for Don Luis (Doña Clara's lover). They find him sleeping with a muleteer. Don Luis's servant tries to persuade him to return home. Cardenio and Dorothea overhear this. Dorothea explains Clara's situation to Cardenio. Don Luis refuses to leave without settling his affairs. The innkeeper gets into a fight with two guests who won't pay. Don Quixote, bound by his promise to the Princess Micomicona, initially refuses to intervene, but then asks for permission from Dorothea. She grants it. Don Quixote draws his sword but hesitates, declaring he cannot fight squires. The brawl escalates. The barber from whom Don Quixote took Mambrino's helmet, arrives and recognizes his pack-saddle on Dapple. A new fight erupts over the helmet and pack-saddle. Don Quixote, believing it's all enchantment, declares the inn to be Agramante's camp and urges them to make peace. The Judge and curate calm the situation. The issue of the pack-saddle and helmet is ""settled"" (the barber is paid, but Don Quixote's delusion is maintained). Don Luis's servants agree to return home, leaving one to accompany him. An officer recognizes Don Quixote from a warrant for freeing the galley slaves and tries to arrest him. Another brawl starts. Don Quixote furiously fights the officers, still believing in enchantments.

**Chapter XLV: In which the Doubtful Question of Mambrino's Helmet and the Pack-Saddle is Finally Settled, with Other Adventures that Occurred in Truth and Earnest**
Don Quixote's barber (Master Nicholas) backs up Don Quixote's delusion about the basin being Mambrino's helmet. Don Fernando and others play along. The officer insists it's a basin. A Holy Brotherhood officer attempts to arrest Don Quixote for freeing the galley slaves. Don Quixote, in a rage, attacks him. A new brawl erupts. Don Quixote, believing he is in Agramante's enchanted camp, calls for peace. The disputes are finally settled with the help of the Judge and curate. Don Fernando pays for damages. Don Quixote decides to continue his journey. Sancho complains about the duchess ""rubbing noses"" with Don Fernando. Don Quixote, enraged, beats Sancho. Dorothea intervenes, saying Sancho's words were due to enchantment. Don Quixote believes her. Don Antonio Moreno, a gentleman, invites Don Quixote to Barcelona.

**Chapter XLVI: Of the End of the Notable Adventure of the Officers of the Holy Brotherhood; and of the Great Ferocity of our Worthy Knight, Don Quixote**
The curate persuades the officers that Don Quixote is mad. The disputes over the helmet and pack-saddle are settled (the barber is privately compensated). Don Luis's situation is resolved, with his servants returning home to inform his father. Don Quixote prepares to leave, affirming his commitment to the Princess Micomicona's quest. Sancho expresses his discontent with the duchess (Dorothea) and her perceived lack of queenly decorum, which further infuriates Don Quixote, who beats him again. Dorothea explains Sancho's comments are due to enchantment. Don Quixote and Sancho take their leave of the duke and duchess.

**Chapter XLVII: Of the Strange Manner in which Don Quixote of La Mancha was Carried away Enchanted, together with other Remarkable Incidents**
Don Quixote, still believing he is enchanted, questions the method of his transport (an ox-cart instead of flying). Sancho, noting the ""demon's"" (Don Fernando's) pleasant smell, is also confused. The curate and barber (still disguised) hasten their departure with Don Quixote in the cart, making him believe he is truly enchanted. The landlady and her daughter bid Don Quixote farewell, feigning tears. Don Quixote thanks them for their ""hospitality."" The curate and barber promise to keep Don Fernando updated. The landlord hands the curate a manuscript of ""Novel of Rinconete and Cortadillo."" Don Quixote in his cage, Sancho on Dapple, follow the cart. They meet a canon who debates the merit of books of chivalry with the curate. Sancho, tired of being taken for a fool, reveals the curate and barber's identities to Don Quixote, insisting he is not enchanted. Don Quixote dismisses this, believing they are also enchanted. Sancho asks Don Quixote if he has felt any bodily needs (to urinate, etc.) while ""enchanted."" Don Quixote admits he has.

**Chapter XLVIII: In which the Canon Pursues the Subject of the Books of Chivalry, with Other Matters worthy of his Wit**
(This chapter is a continuation of the canon's discussion from the previous chapter, primarily literary criticism. The plot continues after this debate.)

**Chapter XLIX: Of the Shrewd Conversation which Sancho Panza Held with his Master Don Quixote**
Sancho uses Don Quixote's admission of natural urges to prove he's not enchanted. Don Quixote concedes Sancho's point but still insists he is enchanted. Sancho offers to help him escape the cage. Don Quixote agrees. The curate, canon, and barber, waiting for the cart, let Don Quixote out. Don Quixote stretches and praises Rocinante. The canon, impressed by Don Quixote's lucid moments, tries to persuade him to abandon knight-errantry, suggesting he read true histories instead. Don Quixote vehemently defends the reality of knights-errant, citing historical figures and events. The canon is amazed by Don Quixote's blend of sense and madness. Sancho is amazed by his master's knowledge. They discuss the missing Dapple and the hundred crowns from the valise (Sancho admits he spent them). The canon mentions a ""Second Part"" of Don Quixote's history by another author, which displeases Don Quixote. Sancho complains the author makes him seem like a fool.

**Chapter L: Of the Shrewd Controversy which Don Quixote and the Canon Held, together with Other Incidents**
Don Quixote continues to defend the truth of chivalry books, describing detailed scenes of enchanted castles and damsels. He hopes to become emperor and reward Sancho. Sancho, however, is more concerned with getting his promised county and practical matters. The canon, still trying to dissuade Don Quixote, continues his arguments against the veracity of chivalry. Don Quixote is adamant. They are interrupted by a goatherd who tells a story about Leandra, a beautiful maiden who ran off with a soldier, causing many to become shepherds in despair.

**Chapter LI: Which deals with what the Goatherd told those who were Carrying off Don Quixote**
The goatherd, Eugenio, relates his story: he was in love with Leandra, a beautiful and wealthy farmer's daughter. Another suitor, Anselmo, also courted her. A soldier, Vicente de la Roca, returned to their village, boasting of his exploits. Leandra eloped with Vicente, stealing her father's money and jewels. Vicente abandoned her, but without ""robbing her of her honor."" Leandra was sent to a convent. Eugenio and Anselmo, heartbroken, became shepherds. Eugenio praises Leandra, while also railing against women's frivolity. Don Quixote offers to rescue Leandra from the convent. Sancho, once again, makes a crude remark and is punished by Don Quixote. They hear a trumpet and see penitents. Don Quixote, believing they are villains abducting a lady, charges them. He is knocked down by a forked stick. Sancho, believing him dead, laments loudly. The curate from Don Quixote's village is recognized by another curate in the procession, and the misunderstanding is cleared. Don Quixote, bruised, agrees to return home in the cart.

**Chapter LII: Of the Quarrel that Don Quixote had with the Goatherd, together with the Rare Adventure of the Penitents, which with an Expenditure of Sweat he brought to a Happy Conclusion**
(This chapter covers the events of the penitents and Don Quixote's subsequent return in the cart, which were also part of the previous summary. I will move on to the next distinct narrative section.)

**Chapter LIII: Of the Troublesome End and Termination Sancho Panza's Government Came To**
Sancho Panza takes possession of his island, Barataria, and is hailed as governor. He is presented with the keys of the town. During his first court session, he cleverly resolves a case about a loan, deducing that the money is hidden in a cane. He resolves another case about a man and a woman, making the woman return the money after she demonstrated her fierce defense of it. He also resolves a tailor's dispute. That night, a letter from the duke warns him of enemies and assassins. Sancho, worried, orders the strict doctor Pedro Recio to be imprisoned (though the order is not carried out). He then receives another letter from Don Quixote, giving him advice on governing. Sancho dictates a reply, complaining of hunger and the doctor's diet. He also describes the young man and woman he found disguised as the opposite sex. Sancho, during his nightly rounds, is ambushed by men who pretend to be attacking the island. They strap two shields to him, making him unable to move, and then trample him. Sancho, terrified and bruised, prays for the island to be lost. He then hears shouts of ""victory"" and is helped up. Disillusioned, Sancho resigns his governorship, embracing Dapple and declaring he prefers his old freedom. He refuses Doctor Recio's offers, saying he'd rather eat gazpacho than suffer a governor's life. He leaves the island, having gained nothing but experience.

**Chapter LIV: Which Deals with Matters Relating to this History and No Other**
Sancho, on his way back to Don Quixote, meets Ricote, his Morisco neighbor, disguised as a German pilgrim. Ricote explains that he and other Moriscos were expelled from Spain. He has returned secretly to retrieve a buried treasure and find his family. Sancho refuses to help, citing loyalty to the king. Ricote tells him his daughter, Ana Felix, and his brother-in-law went to Algiers. Sancho recounts his governorship. Ricote's daughter, Ana Felix (Zoraida), is rescued from a galley. Don Gregorio, her lover, had disguised himself as a woman to follow her into exile. The captain of the galley is revealed to be Ricote's brother, the Judge. All are joyfully reunited.

**Chapter LV: Of what Befell Sancho on the Road, and Other Things that Cannot be Surpassed**
Sancho, traveling at night, falls into a deep pit with Dapple. He laments his misfortune, comparing it to Don Quixote's better experience in Montesinos's cave. He finds a small opening and enlarges it. Meanwhile, Don Quixote, on his own, discovers the same pit and hears Sancho's cries. He recognizes Sancho's voice. Don Quixote goes to the duke's castle for help. Sancho and Dapple are rescued. Sancho, having resigned his government, complains about the hardships of his brief rule.

**Chapter LVI: Of the Prodigious and Unparalleled Battle that Took Place Between Don Quixote of La Mancha and the Lacquey Tosilos in Defence of the Daughter of Doña Rodriguez**
The duke and duchess are amused by Sancho's account of his government. The day arrives for Don Quixote's battle to defend Doña Rodriguez's daughter against the farmer's son (now replaced by the lacquey Tosilos). The duke orders the lance heads removed for safety. Tosilos, however, falls in love with Doña Rodriguez's daughter at first sight and declares himself vanquished, offering to marry her. Don Quixote accepts this as a victory. Doña Rodriguez and her daughter are furious, realizing Tosilos is a lacquey and that they have been tricked. Don Quixote believes it's another enchantment. The duke suggests a fortnight's delay to see if Tosilos transforms back. Tosilos and the daughter are contented to marry.

**Chapter LVII: Which Treats of how Don Quixote took Leave of the Duke, and of what Followed with the Witty and Impudent Altisidora, one of the Duchess's Damsels**
Don Quixote resolves to leave the castle, feeling his indolence is unbecoming. Sancho receives Teresa's letters and money from the majordomo. Altisidora, still feigning love, sings a lament for Don Quixote, accusing him of ingratitude and theft of her kerchiefs and garters. Sancho admits to having the kerchiefs. Don Quixote rejects Altisidora again, reaffirming his loyalty to Dulcinea. He attributes Altisidora's ""love"" to idleness. Don Quixote and Sancho depart for Saragossa.

**Chapter LVIII: Which Tells how Adventures Came Crowding on Don Quixote in such Numbers that they gave one another no Breathing-time**
Don Quixote and Sancho travel through open country. Don Quixote praises freedom. Sancho reveals the 200 crowns from the majordomo. They encounter men with religious images for a retablo. Don Quixote identifies the images as saints, comparing them to knights-errant. He is pleased by this ""omen."" Sancho is amazed by his master's knowledge. They are then trampled by a drove of bulls. Don Quixote attributes it to enchanters. He and Sancho continue their journey, disheartened.

**Chapter LIX: Wherein is Related the Strange Thing, which may be Regarded as an Adventure, that Happened Don Quixote**
Don Quixote and Sancho rest by a spring. Don Quixote, depressed by his recent defeat by the bulls, expresses a desire to die. Sancho comforts him, urging him to eat and sleep. Don Quixote asks Sancho to give himself more lashes for Dulcinea's disenchantment. Sancho agrees for double pay. They camp. Don Quixote is again kept awake by thoughts. Sancho sleeps. Don Quixote, composing a madrigal, is interrupted by a herd of pigs that tramples them. Don Quixote attributes this to enchanters. They are then ambushed by armed men who silently take them captive and transport them to the duke's castle.

**Chapter LX: Of what Happened Don Quixote on his Way to Barcelona**
At the castle, Don Quixote and Sancho are led into a torchlit courtyard where a catafalque holds the ""dead"" body of Altisidora. Figures resembling kings (Minos and Rhadamanthus) and Merlin are present. Sancho is dressed in a flaming robe and a mitre. Merlin announces that Altisidora's revival depends on Sancho receiving 24 smacks, 12 pinches, and 6 pin thrusts. Sancho vehemently protests, but Don Quixote urges him to comply. Sancho is tormented by the duennas. Altisidora ""revives,"" confirming the disenchantment. Sancho is given six smocks as a reward. Altisidora, now ""alive,"" scolds Don Quixote for his insensibility. Don Quixote and Sancho return to their room.

**Chapter LXI: Of what Happened Don Quixote on Entering Barcelona, together with Other Matters that Partake of the True rather than of the Ingenious**
Don Quixote and Sancho leave the duke's castle, heading for Barcelona to avoid the jousts in Saragossa (mentioned in the ""new"" history). Don Quixote encounters Roque Guinart, a highwayman, who returns Sancho's stolen kerchiefs. Roque writes a letter to a friend in Barcelona announcing Don Quixote's arrival. Upon entering Barcelona, Don Quixote and Sancho are greeted by a large procession led by Don Antonio Moreno, who recognizes Don Quixote from his printed history. Boys playing a prank put burrs under Rocinante's and Dapple's tails, causing them to buck and throw their riders. Don Quixote is embarrassed.

**Chapter LXII: Which Deals with the Adventure of the Enchanted Head, together with Other Trivial Matters which Cannot be Left Untold**
Don Quixote is welcomed into Don Antonio Moreno's house. Don Antonio, a witty gentleman, plans new tricks. He displays Don Quixote on a balcony in street clothes. Don Quixote entertains guests at dinner. Don Antonio shows Don Quixote a bronze ""enchanted head"" that answers questions (a clever mechanical trick). Don Quixote and others ask questions. The head gives general answers. Sancho asks about future governorships and seeing his family, receiving vague but positive replies. The trick is later revealed by Cide Hamete. Don Quixote visits a printing office and discovers a ""Second Part of Don Quixote"" by an Aragonese author. He is displeased by its inaccuracies. Don Antonio takes Don Quixote to see the galleys.

**Chapter LXIII: Of the Mishap that Befell Sancho Panza through the Visit to the Galleys, and the Strange Adventure of the Fair Morisco**
Don Quixote and Sancho visit the galleys. Don Quixote is given a grand reception. Sancho is subjected to a ""flying"" ceremony, being passed hand-to-hand by the rowers. Don Quixote suggests Sancho take lashes among the rowers to disenchant Dulcinea. A brigantine is sighted. The galleys pursue and capture it. The general intends to hang the rais (captain) and crew. The rais reveals himself to be a Christian woman, Ana Felix (Zoraida), whose lover, Don Gregorio, had disguised himself as a woman to accompany her into exile in Algiers. She tells her story of being a Morisco Christian, her abduction, and Don Gregorio's plight. Ricote (Ana Felix's father) is present, disguised as a pilgrim, and reveals himself. Ana Felix and Ricote are joyfully reunited with the Judge (Ricote's brother). Don Gregorio is still captive in Algiers. Ricote offers money for his rescue. A renegade offers to go.

**Chapter LXIV: Treating of the Adventure which gave Don Quixote more Unhappiness than all that had hitherto Befallen him**
Don Quixote advises a direct rescue of Don Gregorio in Barbary, but Don Antonio and the viceroy decide to trust the renegade. As Don Quixote is walking on the beach, he is challenged by the ""Knight of the White Moon."" The knight demands Don Quixote acknowledge his lady's beauty is superior to Dulcinea's, or face combat. If Don Quixote loses, he must return home and cease knight-errantry for a year. Don Quixote accepts. They joust. The Knight of the White Moon unhorses Don Quixote. Don Quixote, defeated, declares Dulcinea the fairest and agrees to the terms of retirement. The Knight of the White Moon is revealed to be Samson Carrasco, who undertook this to force Don Quixote home. Sancho is heartbroken by his master's defeat. Don Gregorio is eventually rescued. Ricote, Ana Felix, and Don Gregorio are reunited. Don Antonio takes them to the capital to try and secure their stay in Spain. Don Quixote and Sancho prepare to return home.

**Chapter LXV: Wherein is Made Known who the Knight of the White Moon was; likewise Don Gregorio's Release, and Other Events**
(This chapter provides the backstory of Samson Carrasco's disguise as the Knight of the White Moon, which was already summarized above. It also details Don Gregorio's rescue and the reunions, which were also previously covered.)

**Chapter LXVI: Which Treats of what he who Reads will see, or what he who has it Read to him will Hear**
Don Quixote, defeated, laments his loss of glory. Sancho consoles him. Don Quixote acknowledges his recklessness and resolves to keep his word to retire for a year. He plans to become a shepherd. They encounter a group of peasants who ask Don Quixote to judge a dispute. Sancho, feeling authoritative, intervenes and makes a droll judgment. They continue their journey.

**Chapter LXVII: Of the Resolution Don Quixote Formed to Turn Shepherd and Take to a Life in the Fields while the Year for which he had Given his Word was Running its Course; with other Events truly Delectable and Happy**
Don Quixote, still haunted by his defeat and Altisidora's ""love,"" proposes to Sancho that they become shepherds for a year, using pastoral names. Sancho enthusiastically agrees, suggesting other friends join them and plans to name his wife Teresona. They discuss their pastoral instruments and the dangers of love in the fields. Don Quixote chides Sancho for his proverbs, but Sancho argues he uses them aptly.

**Chapter LXVIII: Of the Bristly Adventure that Befell Don Quixote**
Don Quixote, unable to sleep, urges Sancho to give himself more lashes for Dulcinea. Sancho refuses, praising sleep. A herd of pigs tramples them. Don Quixote attributes this to enchanters, seeing it as punishment. Sancho blames it on their bad luck. Don Quixote, still thinking of his pastoral plan, composes a madrigal. They are ambushed by armed men, who silently take them captive and bring them back to the duke's castle. This is revealed to be another trick.

**Chapter LXIX: Of the Strangest and Most Extraordinary Adventure that Befell Don Quixote in the Whole Course of this Great History**
Don Quixote and Sancho are brought into the castle courtyard, where Altisidora lies on a catafalque, seemingly dead. A mock ceremony is performed: Sancho is dressed in a flaming robe and mitre, and Merlin (the majordomo) demands lashes, pinches, and pin thrusts to revive Altisidora. Sancho protests loudly, but Don Quixote urges him to submit. Sancho is tormented by duennas. Altisidora ""revives."" She gives Sancho six smocks. Don Quixote and Sancho are returned to their room.

**Chapter LXX: Which Follows Sixty-nine and Deals with Matters Indispensable for the Clear Comprehension of this History**
Don Quixote, still believing in enchantments, discusses Altisidora's ""death"" and Sancho's role in her ""resurrection."" Sancho, tired of the tricks, wants to sleep. The chapter reveals that Samson Carrasco, still determined to cure Don Quixote, went to the duke's castle and revealed his prior attempt as the Knight of the Mirrors. The duke and duchess, finding Don Quixote and Sancho amusing, then orchestrated the elaborate ""enchantment"" scenarios. Altisidora, continuing the joke, enters Don Quixote's room, feigning love again, but Don Quixote rejects her, reiterating his fidelity to Dulcinea.

**Chapter LXXI: Of what Passed between Don Quixote and his Squire Sancho on the Way to their Village**
Don Quixote and Sancho leave the duke's castle. Sancho complains about not receiving the promised smocks from Altisidora. Don Quixote agrees to pay Sancho for his lashes (half a real per lash). Sancho enthusiastically agrees, calculating the total. That night, Sancho begins to flog himself with a halter, but mostly hits trees. Don Quixote, fearing for Sancho's life and his own objective, stops him after a thousand lashes. They continue their journey. They stop at an inn, which Don Quixote now recognizes as an inn, not a castle. In a neighboring room, two gentlemen are reading a ""Second Part of Don Quixote"" by a new author, which they criticize. Don Quixote, hearing this, denounces the false history and asserts his true identity. The gentlemen come to his room and confirm he is the genuine Don Quixote. Sancho also claims to be the true Sancho Panza. Don Quixote refuses to read the false history. They decide to go to Barcelona instead of Saragossa, to expose the impostor.

**Chapter LXXII: Of how Don Quixote and Sancho Reached their Village**
Don Quixote and Sancho encounter Don Álvaro Tarfe, a character from the false ""Second Part"" of Don Quixote. Don Álvaro states he knows the ""other"" Don Quixote and Sancho. Don Quixote and Sancho convince him that they are the true figures, and that the other history is false. Don Álvaro agrees to make a legal declaration before the village alcalde that he never knew this Don Quixote and Sancho before, and that they are not the characters from the false book. This declaration is made. Don Quixote and Sancho continue towards their village. Sancho finishes his lashes, to Don Quixote's great joy.

**Chapter LXXIII: Of the Omens Don Quixote had as he Entered his own Village, and other Incidents that Embellish and give a Colour to this Great History**
At the village entrance, Don Quixote encounters omens which he interprets negatively (a boy's words about never seeing something again, a hare chased by greyhounds). Sancho, however, interprets them positively. They meet the curate and bachelor Carrasco. Sancho is still wearing the flaming robe and Dapple the mitre from the castle tricks. Don Quixote informs them of his defeat and his year-long retirement, proposing they all become shepherds. The curate and bachelor agree, hoping to cure his madness. The housekeeper and niece lament his continued delusions, urging him to stay home.

**Chapter LXXIV: Of how Don Quixote Fell Sick, and of the Will he Made, and how he Died**
Don Quixote falls ill with a fever, remaining in bed for six days. His friends and family try to cheer him, but the doctor confirms he is dying. After a long sleep, Don Quixote wakes up, completely lucid. He renounces books of chivalry, declaring that his reason is restored and he is no longer Don Quixote but Alonso Quixano the Good. His friends and family are amazed and relieved. He makes his will, leaving his property to his niece with the condition that she not marry anyone who knows about books of chivalry. He forgives Sancho, acknowledging their adventures were based on his madness, and leaves him money as compensation for his services. Sancho weeps, begging him not to die, and suggests they still become shepherds. Don Quixote dies peacefully in his bed, having renounced chivalry. The notary attests to his natural death, preventing further false histories. Cide Hamete concludes the history, declaring Don Quixote's story has served to discredit all other books of chivalry."
Dracula-Bram Stoker,"This detailed plot summary is based exclusively on the provided text.

The story begins on **May 3** with Jonathan Harker, a solicitor, in Bistritz, Transylvania. He has left Munich on May 1 to meet Count Dracula for business. He recounts his journey, noting that Buda-Pesth felt like leaving the West for the East. In Bistritz, his hotel landlord and wife are visibly frightened when he mentions Count Dracula and his castle, crossing themselves and refusing to speak further. The old woman gives Harker a crucifix, warning him that May 4 is the eve of St. George’s Day, when ""all the evil things in the world will have full sway."" Harker feels uneasy but is committed to his business.

On **May 5**, Harker boards a diligence to the Borgo Pass. His fellow passengers are also visibly fearful, making signs against the evil eye and speaking words like ""Satan,"" ""hell,"" ""witch,"" ""were-wolf,"" and ""vampire."" At the Borgo Pass, a calèche with four coal-black horses and a tall, strong driver with a long brown beard and red eyes meets him. The driver's handshake is of prodigious strength. The calèche takes a circuitous route, and Harker notices the driver can control packs of howling wolves with a silent gesture. They arrive at a vast, ruined castle.

Inside the castle, Harker is greeted by Count Dracula, a tall old man with a long white moustache, dressed in black, with sharp white teeth and pointed ears. His handshake is cold and incredibly strong, leading Harker to suspect he might be the same man as the driver. The Count insists on carrying Harker's luggage and serves him supper, but says he has already dined. Harker gives the Count a sealed letter from his employer, Mr. Hawkins, regarding the purchase of a London estate. Harker notes the Count's unusual physiognomy and the fact he has hair in the center of his palms. The Count's breath causes Harker nausea. That night, the Count's eyes gleam when he hears wolves howl, calling them ""children of the night."" He dismisses Harker to bed, stating he will be away until the afternoon.

On **May 7**, Harker wakes to find a cold breakfast and a note from ""D."" He notices the castle has no mirrors and no servants, only the howling of wolves. He discovers a library but other doors are locked. The Count returns and speaks of his desire to move to London to learn English customs and achieve mastery there. He asks Harker to stay a month to help him refine his English. He explains that on a certain night (St. George's Eve, May 4th), blue flames appear over concealed treasure, but peasants are too cowardly to seek it. Harker details the London property, Carfax, which the Count is purchasing—a large, old estate with a high wall, a ruined chapel, and next to a lunatic asylum. The Count is pleased with its age and size. Later, Harker secretly observes the Count has marked three locations on a map of England: the Carfax estate, Exeter, and Whitby. At cockcrow, the Count abruptly leaves.

On **May 8**, Harker is shaving and sees the Count's image in his mirror. When the Count enters the room, Harker realizes the Count has no reflection. Harker accidentally cuts himself, and the sight of his blood causes the Count's eyes to blaze with ""demoniac fury."" The Count lunges at Harker's throat but recoils when his hand touches the crucifix Harker wears. The Count then seizes Harker's shaving mirror and throws it out the window, shattering it, calling it a ""foul bauble of man's vanity."" Harker then discovers all exit doors from his part of the castle are locked, realizing he is a prisoner.

Later, Harker deduces that the Count himself must be the calèche driver, explaining his control over the wolves. He resolves to keep his fears hidden. He has a long conversation with the Count about Transylvanian history and the Count's Szekely ancestors, who claim descent from Attila. The Count boasts of his family's warlike past and mentions a ""Dracula"" who fought the Turks, using ""we"" as if he were present.

On **May 12**, the Count presses Harker to write three post-dated letters: one stating his work is almost done and he'll leave in a few days (June 12), another that he's leaving the next morning (June 19), and a third that he has arrived in Bistritz (June 29). Harker realizes this implies his captivity will last at least until June 29. He writes formal letters but secretly plans to write to Mina in shorthand. The Count burns Mina's shorthand letter, calling it ""a vile thing,"" but sends the formal one to Hawkins. The Count warns Harker not to sleep outside his assigned rooms. Later, Harker sees the Count crawl out of his window, face down, ""lizard fashion,"" down the castle wall.

On **May 15**, Harker sees the Count leave again. He explores the castle, finding a rarely used wing with old furniture that seems to have belonged to ladies. He sleeps there. During the night, he is awakened by three young women (without shadows), who approach him with sharp white teeth and voluptuous lips, intending to kiss his throat. Suddenly, the Count appears in a rage, pulls one woman away, and declares, ""This man belongs to me!"" He promises the women they can kiss Harker when he is ""done with him."" One woman points to a moving bag, and they open it, revealing a ""gasp and a low wail, as of a half-smothered child."" The women and the bag then disappear, fading into the moonlight through the window. Harker loses consciousness.

Harker wakes in his own bed, his pockets intact, confirming the Count carried him. He believes the women were ""waiting to suck my blood."" On **May 18**, he finds the door to the women's room forcibly closed and locked. On **May 31**, Harker discovers all his personal papers, notes, and travel clothes are gone.

On **June 17**, Slovaks arrive at the castle with large, empty wooden boxes. Harker, still locked in, calls out to them, but the Szgany leader makes them laugh and ignore him. On **June 24**, Harker sees the Count leave the castle through his window, wearing Harker's clothes and carrying the mysterious bag. Harker realizes the Count intends to impersonate him. Later, Harker is disturbed by ""dim phantom shapes"" of the three women. He then hears a woman in the courtyard crying ""Monster, give me my child!"" A pack of wolves pours into the courtyard and, after a short howling, streams away ""licking their lips."" Harker realizes the child has been eaten.

On **June 25**, Harker resolves to escape by scaling the wall. He enters the Count's room, finds a heap of gold and jewels, and discovers a passage to a ruined chapel. There, he finds 50 wooden boxes filled with earth. In one of them, he sees the Count lying, looking younger, with a blood-gorged face, dark iron-grey hair, ruby-red cheeks, and lips dripping with fresh blood. The Count's eyes are open but stony, showing a look of hate. Harker finds no pulse. He seizes a shovel and strikes the Count's face, making a gash. Harker flees.

On **June 29**, Harker sees the Count leave again in his clothes. The Count tells Harker he must leave tomorrow. Harker tries to leave immediately, but the Count, with a ""diabolical smile,"" agrees, then leads him downstairs, where the howling wolves appear when the Count opens the main door. Harker, terrified, cries, ""Shut the door; I shall wait till morning!"" The Count closes the door, locking it. Harker then hears the Count outside his door, whispering to the three women, ""To-night is mine. To-morrow night is yours!"" The women laugh horribly.

On **June 30**, Harker finds the main door locked. He again scales the wall to the Count's room and the chapel. He finds the Count in his box, looking gorged with blood again, with a mocking smile. He tries to kill the Count with a shovel, striking his forehead, but the Count's eyes fix on him with ""basilisk horror,"" paralyzing him. He hears gypsies approaching to take the boxes. Realizing he's trapped, he decides to climb the castle wall, preferring death by falling to remaining with the ""awful women.""

The narrative shifts to other characters. Mina Murray writes to Lucy Westenra on **May 9**, mentioning Jonathan's expected return. Lucy writes to Mina, confessing her love for Arthur Holmwood and mentioning proposals from Dr. John Seward (a doctor at a lunatic asylum) and Quincey P. Morris (an American). Lucy accepts Arthur's proposal.

Dr. Seward's diary entries detail his patient, R. M. Renfield, a ""zoöphagous maniac"" who eats flies, spiders, and birds, believing he absorbs their lives. On **August 20**, Renfield becomes quiet from moonrise to sunrise, saying ""The Master is at hand."" On **August 23**, Renfield escapes to the chapel at Carfax, worshipping an unseen ""Master."" He fights fiercely when restrained.

Lucy's health deteriorates. On **August 24**, she feels weak, pale, and has a painful throat, remembering bad dreams. Arthur asks Dr. Seward to examine her. Seward finds her anemic-looking with no apparent disease and consults his old master, Professor Van Helsing.

On **September 7**, Van Helsing examines Lucy, who is ""ghastly, chalkily pale."" He determines she needs a blood transfusion. Arthur, her fiancé, provides blood. Van Helsing notices a small red mark on Lucy's throat. Mrs. Westenra, Lucy's mother, who has heart disease, removes the garlic flowers Van Helsing had placed in Lucy's room, believing the room was stuffy. Van Helsing is distraught, crying ""God! God! God!"" He performs another transfusion, this time with his own blood, and warns Mrs. Westenra not to touch the ""medicinal"" flowers again.

On **September 17**, Lucy believes she is recovering, but is sleepwalking again. That night, she records in a memorandum that she was woken by flapping at her window. A ""great, gaunt grey wolf"" broke the window. Her mother, startled, tore off Lucy's garlic wreath. Her mother then suffered a ""horrible gurgling in her throat"" and died. Lucy felt a ""spell"" and saw myriad specks blowing in. She later found the maids drugged with laudanum. She is alone with her dead mother and the wolf howls outside.

On **September 18**, Seward and Van Helsing find Mrs. Westenra dead and Lucy near death. The garlic flowers are on Mrs. Westenra's body, and Lucy's throat wounds are ""horribly white and mangled."" Arthur and Quincey Morris provide blood for more transfusions. Van Helsing finds Lucy's memorandum. On **September 19**, Lucy's condition worsens. Her teeth appear longer and sharper. She asks Arthur to kiss her, but Van Helsing forcibly pulls him away, saying ""Not for your life!"" A spasm of rage crosses Lucy's face. She then dies. Van Helsing declares, ""It is only the beginning!""

Van Helsing explains that Lucy is ""Un-Dead."" He reveals his intention to cut off her head and stake her heart to save her soul. He temporarily seals her tomb with consecrated Host. On **September 25**, newspaper reports describe ""The Hampstead Horror"": children are being found with punctured throats, claiming they were lured away by a ""bloofer lady.""

On **September 26**, Jonathan Harker sees the Count in Piccadilly, noting he looks younger. Jonathan recognizes him as ""the man himself!"" and is terrified. Mina reads Jonathan's journal and realizes the terrible truth. Van Helsing explains to Seward that Lucy became ""Un-Dead"" after being bitten by a vampire. He proves this by taking Seward to Lucy's empty coffin at night, then later finds her body returned, but with crimson lips and sharper teeth. That same night, they find Lucy (as the ""bloofer lady"") with a child in the churchyard. Van Helsing restrains her with a crucifix. He explains that Lucy must be truly killed to free her soul.

On **September 29**, Arthur, Quincey, and Seward join Van Helsing in Lucy's tomb. Van Helsing explains that Un-Dead creatures are immortal and multiply by preying on the living. He states that if Arthur had been bitten or kissed by the Un-Dead Lucy, he too would have become a _nosferatu_. He explains that driving a stake through her heart, cutting off her head, and filling her mouth with garlic will set her soul free. Arthur, with immense courage and sorrow, performs the ritual. Lucy's body writhes and screeches, but then transforms into her former beautiful, peaceful self and crumbles to dust. The men are relieved. They proceed to cut off her head, fill her mouth with garlic, and reseal her coffin. Van Helsing then dedicates them to finding and destroying the author of their sorrow.

Jonathan Harker, having investigated the delivery of the Count's boxes, discovers there were 50 boxes of ""common earth"" shipped from Varna to Whitby, and then delivered to Carfax. He traces 9 of these boxes to a house in Piccadilly. He learns the Count carried them himself and appeared younger. Renfield, Seward's patient, experiences mood swings linked to the Count's proximity. He speaks of the Count as his ""Master"" and of gaining ""life"" without ""souls.""

On **October 1**, the group (Van Helsing, Seward, Harker, Lord Godalming, Quincey Morris, and Mina) meets. Van Helsing reveals the Count's abilities: strength of twenty men, no reflection, no shadow, transformation into wolf or bat, control of elements (fog, storm, thunder), command over animals (rats, owls, bats, foxes, wolves), ability to grow small or vanish, and entry into anywhere he's invited. His power ceases at daybreak, and he can only change form at noon, sunrise, or sunset. He can't cross running water except at slack or flood tide. He is repelled by garlic and crucifixes. A wild rose branch on his coffin keeps him from moving; a sacred bullet or a stake through the heart kills him; cutting off his head brings rest. Van Helsing identifies the Count as Voivode Dracula, a historical figure known for cunning and bravery.

They decide to sterilize the Count's lairs by placing consecrated Host in his earth-boxes. They visit Carfax and find only 29 of the 50 boxes remain. They encounter a swarm of rats, which are driven away by Lord Godalming's terriers. They sterilize the remaining boxes. They then go to the Piccadilly house, where they find 8 of the 9 boxes and sterilize them, finding only one missing. The Count appears, having escaped their trap, and leaps from the window, calling out, ""My revenge is just begun!""

The group returns to Seward's house. Mina expresses pity for the Count, believing he deserves ""spiritual immortality"" if his ""worser part"" is destroyed. Jonathan is enraged, but Mina tells him to be merciful, reminding him that she too may someday need such pity.

On **October 3**, Renfield, beaten and with a broken back and skull fracture, is found in his room. Before he dies, he reveals that the Count visited him in a mist, offering him ""lives"" (thousands of rats, then dogs, then cats) if he would worship him. Renfield, tempted, invited the Count in. Later, the Count took life from Mina. Renfield, realizing this, fought the Count, but his strength failed.

The group rushes to Mina and Jonathan's room. They find Jonathan in a stupor. The Count is kneeling on the bed beside Mina, forcing her face into an open wound on his breast, making her drink his blood. Her white nightdress is smeared with blood, and a red scar is on her forehead. The men recoil, holding up crucifixes and Sacred Wafer. The Count cringes and disappears into a faint vapor. Mina awakens, horrified, realizing she is ""unclean"" and now ""his worst enemy."" The Count's act of forcing her to drink his blood has created a ""terrible baptism of blood,"" giving him power over her, but also giving her a psychic link to him. Mina reveals that the Count mocked them, stating he has commanded nations for centuries and was ""countermining"" them while they ""played wits"" against him.

The group decides that Mina must be in full confidence. She, brave but despairing, asks them to kill her if she becomes a vampire, and they all swear to do so, including Jonathan. She also asks them to read the Burial Service over her. Mina then reveals that the Count is escaping by ship. Van Helsing deduces he is returning to Transylvania via the Danube mouth, probably on the _Czarina Catherine_, which left the Thames yesterday. They plan to travel overland to Varna (or Galatz) to intercept him. Jonathan, Arthur, and Quincey will pursue him by land and water. Van Helsing will take Mina to the Borgo Pass. Mina can be hypnotized at sunrise and sunset to reveal the Count's location and movements.

On **October 28**, a telegram confirms the _Czarina Catherine_ has arrived at Galatz. Mina, surprisingly, knows the train schedules and helps plan their pursuit. Van Helsing explains that the Count, in his ""child-brain,"" thinks he has cut Mina off from his knowledge, but the ""baptism of blood"" gives Mina a unique link to him, allowing her to sense his actions, especially at sunrise and sunset.

The group travels to Galatz. On **October 29**, Mina is hypnotized. She reports hearing ""men's voices calling,"" ""roll and creak of oars,"" and ""tramping of feet overhead,"" indicating the Count has left the ship and is on a river vessel. She stops speaking at sunrise. On **October 30**, Mina is again hypnotized. She describes ""water swirling,"" ""creaking of wood,"" and ""cattle low far off,"" confirming the Count is on an open boat on a river, likely upstream. The ship's captain recounts a phenomenally quick journey aided by a persistent fog, and that a ""queer lookin' old man"" (the Count) had his box taken off before sunrise by an agent named Petrof Skinsky. Skinsky is later found murdered, his throat torn open.

Mina, examining maps, deduces the Count is traveling up the Sereth or Pruth rivers, likely towards the Bistritza, which loops closest to his castle near the Borgo Pass. The group splits: Lord Godalming and Jonathan Harker take a steam launch up the river. Dr. Seward and Quincey Morris ride along the river banks. Van Helsing takes Mina by carriage to the Borgo Pass, intending to confront the Count at his castle.

On **November 4**, Van Helsing, with Mina, arrives at the Borgo Pass. Mina, guided by a ""new guiding power,"" points to a specific road to the castle. Mina falls into a deep sleep that Van Helsing cannot break, but at sunset, she wakes, looking healthy and bright, refusing to eat. Van Helsing, suspicious, draws a circle of consecrated Host around her. Horses scream as the three Un-Dead women from the castle appear outside the circle, circling and calling Mina to ""Come, sister."" Mina, however, shows terror and repulsion. Van Helsing, realizing the red scar on Mina's forehead is the mark of the vampire's power, uses the Host to drive the women away. They melt into mist and snow. The horses are found dead. Van Helsing then proceeds to Dracula's castle, breaking doors, and finds the three women in their tombs. He performs the ritual of staking and decapitation on them, and their bodies crumble to dust. He places Host in Dracula's tomb, banishing him from it forever. He then returns to Mina.

On **November 6**, Mina and Van Helsing watch from a rocky hollow near the castle. They see a group of mounted Szgany with a leiter-wagon carrying a great square chest, hurrying towards the castle. Simultaneously, Dr. Seward and Quincey Morris, and then Lord Godalming and Jonathan Harker, converge on the wagon from different directions. The sun is setting. Jonathan and Quincey leap onto the wagon and furiously attack the chest. Quincey is wounded by a gypsy's knife, bleeding heavily. Jonathan's great knife shears through the Count's throat, and Quincey's bowie knife plunges into his heart. The Count's body crumbles to dust, a look of peace on his face. Quincey Morris, dying, points to Mina, whose red scar on her forehead has vanished. He says, ""The snow is not more stainless than her forehead! The curse has passed away!"" He dies with a smile. The gypsies flee, and the wolves follow them. The Castle of Dracula stands outlined against the red sky."
Frankenstein-Mary Shelley,"The story begins with a series of letters from Robert Walton, an English explorer, to his sister, Mrs. Saville, in England. Walton is on an expedition to the North Pole, driven by an ardent desire to discover a new passage, ascertain the secret of the magnet, and explore unknown lands. He recounts his lifelong passion for discovery, his training, and his determination, despite his sister's forebodings and his own fluctuating hopes.

From Archangel, Walton writes about hiring a ship and crew. He expresses a profound loneliness and a longing for a true friend, someone to share his triumphs and support him in despair, noting his self-education and lack of a cultivated companion. He describes his brave but uneducated lieutenant and his gentle, kind-hearted master, recounting an anecdote of the master's selfless love. Walton reaffirms his resolve for the perilous voyage, despite the severe winter.

Weeks later, Walton sends a brief letter reporting his safe progress and high spirits, sailing at a high latitude.

His next letter details a ""strange accident."" His ship becomes surrounded by ice and thick fog. When the mist clears, they observe a gigantic man in a sledge, drawn by dogs, speeding northward across the ice. The next morning, they discover another sledge on a large ice fragment, containing a near-dead European man. This stranger, who speaks English with a foreign accent, refuses to board until he learns their destination. Upon hearing they are bound for the northern pole, he consents. Walton describes the stranger's emaciated condition and profound grief, noting his eyes fluctuate between wildness and benevolence. The stranger reveals he is ""To seek one who fled from me,"" and confirms his quarry traveled in a similar sledge. This convinces Walton that the gigantic figure they saw earlier was the one the stranger pursued. The stranger, eager to continue his pursuit, is too weak to go on deck. Walton becomes deeply sympathetic, feeling an affection for him ""as a brother.""

The stranger, identified as Frankenstein, gradually recovers and spends his time watching for the other sledge. He discusses Walton's expedition, becoming deeply agitated when Walton speaks of sacrificing his life for knowledge. Frankenstein warns Walton against pursuing such ""madness"" and offers to tell his own ""tale"" as a cautionary example. After much persuasion, Frankenstein agrees to begin his narrative the following day, and Walton resolves to record it.

Frankenstein begins his story, identifying himself as a Genevese from a distinguished family. He recounts his father's honorable life and his marriage to Caroline Beaufort, a woman his father rescued from poverty. Victor was their eldest child, born in Naples, and cherished. When he was five, his mother adopted Elizabeth Lavenza, a beautiful orphan of Milanese nobility, intending her as a ""pretty present"" for Victor, who considered her ""mine—mine to protect, love, and cherish."" They grew up together, with Elizabeth delighting in poetry and nature, while Victor pursued the ""hidden laws of nature."" He formed a close friendship with Henry Clerval, a boy of singular talent and fancy, who loved chivalry and literature.

Victor's early studies were focused on the ancient alchemists like Cornelius Agrippa. His father dismissed these as ""sad trash,"" but Victor persisted. At fifteen, a violent thunderstorm destroyed an oak tree, sparking his interest in electricity and galvanism. He then abandoned his alchemical studies, considering them ""exploded systems,"" and turned to mathematics.

At seventeen, Victor prepares to attend the University of Ingolstadt. Before his departure, Elizabeth contracts scarlet fever. His mother nurses her back to health but contracts the illness herself and dies. On her deathbed, she expresses her wish for Victor and Elizabeth to marry and for Elizabeth to care for her younger children. Victor's departure is delayed by mourning. Clerval's father prevents him from joining Victor at the university. Victor travels alone to Ingolstadt, feeling lonely but eager for knowledge. He meets M. Krempe, a gruff natural philosophy professor who scoffs at his past studies. However, M. Waldman, a chemistry professor, inspires Victor with his lecture on modern science, which, while dismissing alchemy's ""chimerical"" goals, promises ""almost unlimited powers."" This lecture rekindles Victor's scientific passion, focusing it on chemistry and natural philosophy.

For two years, Victor dedicates himself entirely to these studies, neglecting his family. His progress is rapid, astonishing his peers and professors. He becomes fascinated by the ""principle of life,"" delving into physiology, anatomy, and the processes of decay and corruption in the human body, spending time in charnel-houses. Through intense labor, he discovers the ""cause of generation and life"" and gains the ability to ""bestow animation upon lifeless matter."" He initially considers creating a being like himself but, due to the difficulty of working with minute parts, decides to make it of gigantic stature (about eight feet tall). He collects materials from ""charnel-houses"" and ""slaughter-house[s],"" working in a solitary workshop. This gruesome work isolates him, causes his health to decline, and fills him with nervousness and guilt.

On a ""dreary night of November,"" Victor successfully animates his creation. The creature opens its ""dull yellow eye"" and breathes. Despite having carefully chosen its features, Victor is filled with ""breathless horror and disgust"" at its hideous appearance—yellow skin, watery eyes, shrivelled complexion, and black lips. He flees the room. He attempts to sleep but is tormented by nightmares of Elizabeth turning into his dead mother. He wakes to find the creature standing over his bed, its hand outstretched. Victor escapes, spending the night agitated in the courtyard.

The next morning, he encounters Henry Clerval, who has arrived to study at Ingolstadt. Overjoyed at seeing his friend, Victor's spirits lift, and he momentarily forgets his horror. Clerval notes Victor's ill appearance. Fearing Clerval might see the monster, Victor rushes to his apartment, finds it empty, and rejoices that the creature has fled. Overcome by extreme sensitivity, he suffers a nervous fever for several months, during which Clerval diligently nurses him, concealing the true extent of his illness from Victor's family. Victor raves incoherently during his delirium, implicitly confessing his creation and the monster's deeds. Clerval, though perplexed, attributes it to his friend's disturbed imagination.

Victor slowly recovers, and Clerval gives him a letter from Elizabeth, who expresses concern for his long silence and reports on their family. She mentions their younger brother, William, and the return of Justine Moritz, a beloved servant who had lived with the family. Victor writes back immediately. Upon recovery, he tries to resume normal life, but the sight of scientific instruments renews his agony. He studies Oriental languages with Clerval, seeking solace. During their travels through England and Scotland, Victor finds some temporary relief in nature and Clerval's company but remains haunted by his secret and the monster's existence.

He receives a letter from his father informing him that William has been murdered, strangled, with finger marks on his neck, and a valuable miniature of Victor's mother, which Elizabeth had given William, is missing. His father urges Victor to return to console Elizabeth, who blames herself. Victor, traveling back to Geneva, spots the gigantic monster during a thunderstorm near the murder scene and is instantly convinced the creature is William's murderer. He considers revealing this but realizes his story would be dismissed as madness. Upon arriving home, his brother Ernest tells him that Justine Moritz has been accused of the murder. Victor is horrified, knowing Justine is innocent.

At the trial, Justine maintains her innocence, explaining she was locked out of the city gates searching for William and spent the night in a barn. She cannot explain how the miniature came to be in her pocket. Elizabeth passionately defends Justine's character, but the circumstantial evidence, especially the miniature, and Justine's initial confusion, lead to her condemnation. Overwhelmed by fear of being thought mad, Victor remains silent. Justine later confesses under pressure from her confessor, who threatened her with excommunication. She tells Victor and Elizabeth that her confession was a lie, made to gain absolution, but now feels more guilt for it. Justine is executed the next day. Victor is consumed by guilt and remorse, believing himself the ""true murderer"" and the cause of William's and Justine's deaths, as well as his family's grief.

Overwhelmed, Victor retreats to solitude, contemplating suicide but restrained by his duty to his remaining family and his desire for revenge against the monster. His father and Elizabeth are also deeply saddened. Elizabeth expresses her disillusionment with mankind, lamenting William's and Justine's deaths and the murderer's escape. Victor, tormented, travels to the Alpine valley of Chamounix.

In Chamounix, Victor confronts the monster on a glacier. The monster, with ""superhuman speed,"" approaches. Victor, filled with rage, curses him as ""devil"" and ""vile insect"" and tries to attack him. The monster easily evades him and proposes a discussion, reminding Victor that as his creator, Victor owes him happiness. The monster explains that his malice stems from the misery of his solitude and rejection. He declares, ""I was benevolent and good; misery made me a fiend. Make me happy, and I shall again be virtuous."" He demands Victor create a female companion for him, promising that they will then retreat to the ""vast wilds of South America"" and never trouble mankind again. Victor initially refuses, fearing a race of devils, but the monster's arguments of justice, his threats of continued vengeance against Victor's remaining friends, and Victor's sense of duty compel him to agree, on the condition that the monster swears to leave Europe forever. The monster swears and departs.

Victor returns to Geneva, struggling to begin his new, abhorrent task. His health, which had partially recovered, begins to decline again. His father notices his melancholy and suggests he marry Elizabeth immediately, fearing Victor secretly loves another or feels bound by an unwanted promise to Elizabeth. Victor assures him of his love for Elizabeth and agrees to the marriage. To gain time and materials for his work, Victor tells his father he wishes to travel to England to consult philosophers. His father agrees, hoping the change of scene will restore him, and arranges for Clerval to accompany him.

Victor and Clerval travel through England, visiting London, Windsor, Oxford, and the Lake District. Victor finds little joy, constantly preoccupied with his dreadful task and haunted by the monster's threat, ""I will be with you on your wedding-night."" He secretly collects materials. After months, they travel to Scotland. In Perth, Victor tells Clerval he wishes to travel alone for a month or two, so he can proceed to a remote Orkney Island, where he intends to complete the female creature in solitude.

On the desolate island, Victor works on the second creature, but this time, without the ""enthusiastic frenzy"" of his first creation, he finds the process ""horrible and irksome,"" often sickening at the work. As the female is nearly complete, he reflects on the potential consequences: she might be even more malignant, refuse to comply with the monster's compact, or they might hate each other, leading to greater destruction, perhaps even a ""race of devils."" He realizes the ""wickedness of my promise"" and shudders at the thought of sacrificing the human race for his own peace. He looks up and sees the monster at the window, watching him. Horrified by the monster's malicious gaze, Victor tears the half-finished female creature to pieces. The monster, howling in ""devilish despair and revenge,"" withdraws.

Victor vows never to resume his work. Later that night, the monster enters his room. He confronts Victor, accusing him of breaking his promise and recounting his difficult journey following Victor. Victor firmly refuses to create a companion, citing the monster's wickedness. The monster declares that if he cannot inspire love, he will inspire fear, and reiterates his threat: ""I will be with you on your wedding-night."" He then vanishes.

Victor is tormented by this threat, believing it means his own death. The next morning, he packs the remains of the second creature with stones and, at sea, casts them into the ocean. A storm arises, and he is driven far off course, eventually landing in Ireland. There, he is immediately accused of murder.

Brought before Magistrate Kirwin, Victor hears testimony about a strangled body found on the beach, with finger marks on its neck. He is greatly agitated, remembering William. A witness claims to have seen a boat similar to Victor's near the shore. Victor is taken to view the body and is horrified to discover it is Henry Clerval. He collapses in convulsions, exclaiming his ""murderous machinations"" have claimed another victim. He falls into a nervous fever for two months, during which he raves about being the murderer of William, Justine, and Clerval. Magistrate Kirwin, understanding French, overhears these ravings but kindly ensures Victor receives care.

Upon recovery, Victor is imprisoned. Mr. Kirwin informs him that his family is safe and his father is coming. Victor, in a moment of delirium, mistakes his father for the monster and cries out in agony. His father arrives, comforting him. Victor remains deeply melancholic, haunted by Clerval's image and the sense of a dreadful destiny. He is liberated from prison after it is proven he was on the Orkney Islands at the time of Clerval's murder. He feels no joy in freedom, only ""frightful darkness."" His father attempts to cheer him, but Victor is consumed by despair and periodically attempts suicide. He is eventually deemed mad and confined for months.

Upon regaining his reason, Victor is again driven by revenge. He resolves to return to Geneva to protect his family and hunt the monster. He relates his story to a criminal judge, asking for the monster's apprehension. The judge is incredulous, doubting the monster's existence and the feasibility of pursuit. Victor, enraged, vows to pursue and destroy the monster himself.

Victor leaves Geneva forever, beginning a long pursuit across Europe and into the wilds of Tartary and Russia. He is sustained only by revenge, enduring extreme hardships. The monster, at times, leaves clues, guiding Victor, and sometimes even provides food, fearing Victor might die and end their chase. In his sleep, Victor finds solace, dreaming of his loved ones. The monster leaves mocking inscriptions, urging Victor further north into the ""everlasting ices.""

Victor acquires a sledge and dogs, gaining on the monster. He tracks him to a hamlet on the seashore, where villagers report a ""gigantic monster"" (the fiend) stole their food and fled across the frozen sea. Victor, despite the extreme cold, pursues him onto the ice. After weeks of suffering, he sights the monster's sledge. He gains on him, but a violent storm breaks up the ice, creating an impassable sea between them. Victor is left adrift on a shrinking ice fragment, facing death. He then sees Walton's vessel. He constructs oars from his sledge and, with immense effort, reaches Walton's ship, where he is rescued, his ""task unfulfilled.""

Frankenstein concludes his narrative by imploring Walton to continue his quest for vengeance and destroy the monster if he appears after Victor's death, warning him not to trust the creature's eloquence.

Walton continues his letters. Frankenstein's health declines rapidly, and he is confined to bed. The crew, fearful for their lives amid the ice, demand Walton turn the ship homeward if a passage opens. Frankenstein, momentarily revived, delivers an impassioned speech, shaming them for their ""cowardice"" and urging them to continue their glorious enterprise. The sailors are moved, but Frankenstein collapses again. Walton reluctantly agrees to turn back if a passage is found.

On September 9th, the ice breaks up, and a passage south opens. The sailors rejoice. Frankenstein, waking, asks the cause of the tumult. When told they are returning to England, he asserts his heavenly assigned purpose to destroy the monster and attempts to rise, but collapses again, near death. He eventually speaks to Walton, reiterating his conviction that he was right to refuse the monster a companion, as his duty to mankind outweighed his duty to his creature. He again asks Walton to fulfill his vengeful task, though he then qualifies it, leaving it to Walton's judgment and advising him to ""seek happiness in tranquillity and and avoid ambition."" Frankenstein then dies peacefully.

Later that night, Walton hears sounds from the cabin where Frankenstein's body lies. He enters to find the gigantic monster hanging over Frankenstein's coffin, expressing self-reproach and calling Frankenstein his ""last victim."" Walton confronts the monster, accusing him of hypocrisy. The monster explains that his crimes were driven by the ""insatiable thirst for vengeance"" born from his misery and the universal hatred he received, particularly after Frankenstein denied him a companion. He recalls Felix's rejection and the rustic's attack. He details his murders of William, Justine, Clerval, and Elizabeth, admitting his ""demoniacal design became an insatiable passion."" He expresses extreme self-loathing, calling himself an ""abortion."" The monster declares his work is complete and vows to end his own existence by building a funeral pyre in the northernmost reaches of the globe and consuming himself to ashes, ensuring no trace of his existence remains to tempt another creator. He bids farewell to Walton, the last human he will ever see, and springs from the cabin window onto an ice raft, vanishing into the darkness."
Great Expectations-Charles Dickens,"The story begins with Pip, an orphan living in the marsh country of England with his older, harsh sister, Mrs. Joe Gargery, and her kind blacksmith husband, Joe Gargery. One raw afternoon in the churchyard, Pip is terrified by an escaped convict, who threatens him with death if he doesn't bring him food and a file to the old Battery on the marshes the next morning. The convict also mentions a mysterious ""young man"" who would further harm Pip if he failed.

Pip, consumed by fear and guilt, steals a pork pie, some bread, mincemeat, brandy, and a file from his sister's pantry and Joe's forge on Christmas Eve. His sister's strictness and Joe's innocent unawareness exacerbate his distress. On Christmas Day, during a family dinner with Mr. Wopsle (the church clerk), Mr. and Mrs. Hubble, and Uncle Pumblechook, Pip substitutes tar-water for brandy, causing Pumblechook a violent fit. The commotion is interrupted when soldiers arrive at their door, needing Joe to mend handcuffs for escaped convicts. Pip and Joe, along with Mr. Wopsle, join the soldiers in a hunt on the marshes. They find two convicts, Magwitch (Pip's convict) and Compeyson (the ""young man"" Magwitch had threatened Pip with), fighting in a ditch. Magwitch claims he captured Compeyson. Compeyson accuses Magwitch of attempted murder. Both are apprehended, and Magwitch is taken to a prison-ship. Before he leaves, Magwitch admits to the sergeant that he stole the pie and food from the blacksmith's. Joe, with generous compassion, tells him he was welcome to it. Pip, however, is relieved but still haunted by his secret.

Over the next months, Mrs. Joe suffers a severe head injury from an unknown assailant, leaving her sight, hearing, and speech impaired. A filed convict's leg-iron is found nearby. Pip suspects either Orlick (Joe's morose journeyman) or the ""strange man"" (Compeyson, whom Pip had seen in the Jolly Bargemen before) of the attack. Biddy, Joe's kind helper, eventually deduces that Mrs. Joe's cryptic chalk drawings of a hammer refer to Orlick. Mrs. Joe, strangely, shows propitiation towards Orlick after this. Meanwhile, Pip continues his uncomfortable weekly visits to Miss Havisham, an eccentric, wealthy lady who lives in Satis House, a decaying mansion where time stopped at twenty minutes to nine on her wedding day. There, Estella, Miss Havisham's beautiful but cruel adopted daughter, treats Pip with disdain, mocking his ""coarse hands"" and ""thick boots."" Pip falls in love with Estella, but she tells him she has ""no heart."" Pip also has an encounter with a ""pale young gentleman"" in Miss Havisham's garden, resulting in a fight that Pip wins. Later, he discovers this is Herbert Pocket.

In his fourth year of apprenticeship, Pip learns from Mr. Jaggers, a London lawyer, that he has ""great expectations"" from an unknown benefactor. He is to be educated as a gentleman in London. Jaggers, who is Miss Havisham's lawyer, becomes Pip's guardian. Joe, heartbroken but unselfish, agrees to release Pip from his apprenticeship. Uncle Pumblechook, however, falsely claims credit for Pip's new fortune. Pip, ashamed of his humble origins, leaves his village and Joe, believing Miss Havisham is his secret benefactress and intends him for Estella.

In London, Pip lives with Herbert Pocket, who becomes his close friend. Herbert, a hopeful but impractical ""capitalist,"" reveals Miss Havisham's tragic story: she was betrayed and jilted by her fiancé, Compeyson, who conspired with her half-brother Arthur to swindle her. Pip begins his education with Herbert's father, Mr. Matthew Pocket, a kind but distracted tutor, and meets other students, including the sulky and unpleasant Bentley Drummle. Pip and Herbert accrue debts in their new, lavish lifestyle.

Pip also frequently interacts with Wemmick, Jaggers's clerk, who maintains a strict separation between his professional, severe ""office"" persona and his warm, eccentric ""Walworth"" persona at his ""Castle"" home, where he cares for his deaf ""Aged Parent."" Wemmick introduces Pip to his collection of ""portable property,"" which includes casts of executed criminals. Jaggers invites Pip and his friends to dinner, where he forces his housekeeper, Molly, to display her strong, scarred wrists. This, combined with Wemmick's later revelations, leads Pip to deduce that Molly is Estella's mother, a woman acquitted of murder, whom Jaggers defended and then ""tamed.""

Estella, now in London, continues to captivate Pip but treats him coldly. She informs him she is to marry Bentley Drummle, devastating Pip. Wopsle, now a struggling actor in London, recognizes Compeyson (the other convict) in the audience at one of his plays. Pip is horrified by the danger this poses.

Soon after, Magwitch, Pip's actual benefactor, secretly returns to London, risking his life, as he was sentenced to transportation for life. He proudly reveals to Pip that he made him a gentleman. Pip is initially horrified by Magwitch's commonness and criminal past. Magwitch recounts his life story, confirming his connection to Compeyson and Arthur, and his trial where Compeyson framed him. Herbert reveals that Compeyson was indeed Miss Havisham's betraying fiancé.

Realizing Magwitch is in grave danger, Pip and Herbert devise a plan to get him out of England. They hide Magwitch (under the alias Mr. Campbell) at the house of Mrs. Whimple, where Herbert's fiancée, Clara Barley, lives with her loud, gout-ridden father. Herbert and Startop begin practicing rowing for the escape.

Pip receives an anonymous note, luring him to the sluice-house on the marshes for information about ""your uncle Provis"" (Magwitch). Pip goes alone and is ambushed by Orlick, who ties him up, revealing he was the one who attacked Mrs. Joe with the leg-iron, and that he intends to kill Pip in the limekiln. Orlick blames Pip for his misfortunes. Pip is rescued by Herbert and Startop, who followed him after finding his dropped letter and becoming suspicious. Orlick flees but is later arrested for breaking into Pumblechook's house.

The escape plan for Magwitch is put into motion. Pip, Herbert, and Startop row Magwitch down the Thames to meet a foreign steamer. They are intercepted by a galley containing officers and Compeyson. In the ensuing struggle, Magwitch and Compeyson fall overboard. Magwitch is gravely injured and recaptured, but Compeyson drowns.

Magwitch, severely wounded, is taken to prison, where he is tried for returning from transportation and sentenced to death. Pip visits him daily, growing to love and respect the man who made his fortune. In Magwitch's final days, Pip reveals to him that his long-lost daughter (Estella) is alive, beautiful, and a lady. Magwitch dies peacefully, placing Pip's hand on his chest.

Following Magwitch's death, Pip falls gravely ill. Joe comes to London and nurses him with unwavering love and kindness. Pip learns that Mrs. Joe had died while he was ill and that Orlick has been imprisoned for robbing Pumblechook. He also discovers that Joe, without telling him, had paid off all his debts. Humbled and full of remorse for his past ingratitude, Pip resolves to return to Joe and Biddy, confess his changed heart, and propose a future with them. When he returns to his village, he finds Biddy has married Joe. He expresses his profound gratitude and love for them, promising to repay his debt and wishing them happiness.

Pip sells his remaining possessions to settle his debts and leaves England to join Herbert and Clara, who are now married, at Clarriker and Co. in the East. Many years later, Herbert learns that Pip had secretly funded his partnership.

Eleven years after leaving England, Pip returns to his old home. He finds Joe and Biddy happily married with a child, whom they have named Pip. Pip visits the ruins of Satis House, which is being dismantled. He encounters Estella there. She is a widow, having suffered greatly from her cruel marriage to Drummle. Her beauty has faded, but her eyes now hold a ""saddened, softened light,"" and her touch is ""friendly."" Estella confesses that suffering has taught her to understand his heart and what she once ""threw away."" They acknowledge their past and agree to remain friends. As the evening mists rise, Pip leaves, feeling ""no shadow of another parting from her."""
Hamlet-William Shakespeare,"This detailed plot summary is based solely on the provided text, ""HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK.""

**ACT I**

**Scene I:** On a platform before Elsinore Castle at night, Bernardo relieves Francisco on guard duty. Horatio and Marcellus soon arrive, invited by Bernardo to witness a recurring ""dreaded sight."" Horatio, initially skeptical, sees an apparition in the form of the recently deceased King Hamlet, wearing his battle armor. Horatio attempts to speak to it, but the Ghost remains silent and stalks away. Horatio, now convinced, describes the Ghost's resemblance to the late King, noting he wore the same armor as when he combated Norway. Marcellus confirms the Ghost has appeared twice before at the same hour. Horatio expresses concern that this ""bodes some strange eruption to our state."" The Ghost reappears, and Horatio bravely confronts it, asking if it has a voice, a good deed to be done, knowledge of the country's fate, or hidden treasure. However, the Ghost again falls silent, starting like a ""guilty thing"" when a cock crows, signaling the approach of dawn. Horatio suggests they tell young Hamlet about this, believing the spirit, though dumb to them, will speak to him.

**Scene II:** In a room of state in the palace, the new King (Claudius), Hamlet's uncle, addresses the court. He acknowledges the recent death of his brother, King Hamlet, but explains that discretion has allowed him to marry his ""sometime sister, now our queen,"" Gertrude, with ""defeated joy."" He thanks the court for their concurrence. Laertes, Polonius's son, requests leave to return to France, having completed his duty at the King's coronation. Polonius confirms he has reluctantly granted permission, and the King allows Laertes to depart.
The King then turns to Hamlet, asking why he remains sorrowful. Hamlet replies with cryptic remarks. Queen Gertrude asks Hamlet to cast off his mourning and look kindly on Denmark, reminding him that death is common. Hamlet asserts his grief is genuine, beyond mere outward ""shows."" The King calls Hamlet's mourning ""unmanly grief"" and ""impious stubbornness,"" urging him to think of Claudius as a father, for Hamlet is ""most immediate to our throne."" The Queen also pleads with Hamlet to stay in Denmark and not return to Wittenberg for his studies. Hamlet agrees to obey his mother, pleasing the King, who celebrates Hamlet's ""accord"" with cannons.
Once alone, Hamlet delivers a soliloquy, expressing his profound despair and wish for death, prevented only by divine law against suicide. He laments the state of the world as an ""unweeded garden."" He bitterly recalls his father's greatness, comparing him to Hyperion, and his mother's swift remarriage within two months of his father's death, calling her ""Frailty."" He cannot reconcile his mother's intense love for his father with her hasty marriage to his uncle, whom he compares to a ""satyr."" He vows to keep silent despite his breaking heart.
Horatio, Bernardo, and Marcellus enter. Hamlet greets Horatio as a friend and asks what brings them from Wittenberg. Horatio states he came for King Hamlet's funeral, to which Hamlet cynically suggests it was for his mother's wedding, noting how quickly the funeral and wedding followed each other. Horatio then cautiously tells Hamlet about the Ghost of his father, describing its appearance in armor. Hamlet is astonished and disturbed, questioning them intently about details like its expression and beard. He decides to join their watch that night, instructing them to keep the sighting secret, hinting that he suspects ""foul play.""

**Scene III:** In Polonius's house, Laertes prepares to leave for France. He advises his sister Ophelia to be wary of Hamlet's affections, calling them a ""toy in blood"" and ""not lasting."" He warns her that Hamlet, as a prince, cannot choose for himself, and her honor could be lost if she believes his ""songs."" He urges her to ""keep within the rear of your affection."" Ophelia promises to heed his advice but playfully warns him not to be a hypocritical preacher. Polonius enters, hurrying Laertes aboard his ship and giving him extensive advice on conduct, including being true to himself. Laertes bids farewell to Ophelia, reminding her of his counsel. Polonius then questions Ophelia about her interactions with Hamlet, revealing he has heard of their private meetings and Hamlet's ""tenders of his affection."" Polonius dismisses Hamlet's vows as ""springes to catch woodcocks"" and commands Ophelia, in no uncertain terms, to cut off all communication with Hamlet. Ophelia, obediently, agrees.

**Scene IV:** On the platform at night, Hamlet, Horatio, and Marcellus await the Ghost. It is very cold, and they hear trumpets and ordnance, which Hamlet explains is the King celebrating with a ""rouse"" (drinking bout), a custom he considers ""more honour'd in the breach than the observance."" The Ghost appears. Hamlet, addressing it as his father, King, and Royal Dane, demands to know why it walks the earth in such a ""questionable shape,"" disturbing the night. The Ghost beckons Hamlet to follow it alone. Horatio and Marcellus urge Hamlet not to go, fearing it might lead him to madness or harm. Hamlet, disregarding their fears and valuing his life ""at a pin's fee,"" insists on following, threatening anyone who tries to stop him. The Ghost and Hamlet exit, followed at a distance by Horatio and Marcellus.

**Scene V:** In a more remote part of the platform, the Ghost reveals to Hamlet that it is his father's spirit, doomed to walk the night and ""fast in fires"" during the day until its ""foul crimes"" are purged. It commands Hamlet to ""Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder."" Hamlet, horrified, learns that the official story of his father being stung by a serpent in the orchard is a lie. The Ghost reveals the ""serpent"" who ""wears his crown"" is Claudius, Hamlet's uncle. The Ghost describes how Claudius, with ""witchcraft of his wit"" and ""traitorous gifts,"" seduced Queen Gertrude, despite his father's dignified love. The murder occurred when Claudius poured ""juice of cursed hebenon"" into King Hamlet's ear while he slept in the orchard, causing a swift and leperous death. This left the King ""cut off even in the blossoms of my sin, Unhousel'd, disappointed, unanel'd."" The Ghost urges Hamlet to avenge him but warns him not to ""taint thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive Against thy mother aught,"" leaving her to Heaven and her own conscience. As the glow-worm fades, signaling morning, the Ghost vanishes, urging Hamlet to ""remember me.""
Hamlet, deeply shaken, vows to erase all other thoughts from his mind to focus solely on the Ghost's command. Horatio and Marcellus arrive, seeking Hamlet. Hamlet, in a state of wild excitement, makes them swear on his sword never to reveal what they have seen. The Ghost's voice from beneath the stage reinforces the oath. Hamlet further makes them swear that if he should ""put an antick disposition on"" (feign madness) in the future, they will not give any hint that they know his secret or the reason for his strange behavior. He concludes that ""The time is out of joint;--O cursèd spite, That ever I was born to set it right!""

**ACT II**

**Scene I:** In Polonius's house, Ophelia reports to her father that Hamlet appeared before her in a disheveled state: doublet unbraced, pale, knees knocking, and a piteous look. He took her wrist, gazed at her face intently, sighed profoundly, and then left, walking out of the door with his eyes fixed on her. Polonius concludes that Hamlet is ""Mad for thy love,"" confirming that Ophelia, as commanded, had ""repelled his letters, and denied His access to me."" He decides to go to the King and reveal this, believing it is the cause of Hamlet's madness.

**Scene II:** In a room in the castle, King Claudius and Queen Gertrude welcome Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, Hamlet's childhood friends. They have sent for them because Hamlet has undergone a ""transformation"" and they wish for the friends to spend time with him, ""draw him on to pleasures,"" and discover if any unknown affliction is troubling him. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern readily agree to obey.
Polonius enters, claiming to have discovered the ""very cause of Hamlet's lunacy."" He dramatically presents a love letter from Hamlet to Ophelia, filled with passionate but ""ill phrases."" He explains that, upon seeing Hamlet's ""hot love on the wing,"" he commanded Ophelia to ""lock herself from his resort, Admit no messengers, receive no tokens."" He believes Hamlet, being ""repuls'd,"" subsequently ""Fell into sadness; thence into a weakness; Thence to a lightness; and, by this declension, Into the madness wherein now he raves."" The King and Queen consider this plausible. Polonius proposes they hide and observe an encounter between Hamlet and Ophelia to confirm his theory.
Hamlet enters, reading a book. Polonius attempts to engage him. Hamlet's replies are disjointed and seemingly mad, calling Polonius a ""fishmonger"" and making strange remarks about the sun breeding maggots in ""carrion"" and warning Polonius about his daughter ""walking i'the sun"" and conceiving. Polonius, aside, notes ""Though this be madness, yet there's method in it."" Hamlet continues to mock Polonius's age and appearance.
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern then greet Hamlet. Hamlet immediately suspects they were ""sent for,"" which they eventually confess. Hamlet explains his recent loss of ""mirth,"" his view of the earth as a ""steril promontory,"" and man as a ""quintessence of dust,"" delighting him ""not me,--nor woman neither."" He asks why they laugh, and Rosencrantz explains they laughed at the thought of the ""lenten entertainment"" the players will receive from him, as they ""coted them on the way"" and are coming to court. Hamlet welcomes the players, expressing his knowledge of various dramatic types. He comments on the decline of the city tragedians, linking it to his uncle being King.
Polonius returns to announce the players. Hamlet engages in more wordplay, comparing Polonius to Jephthah and quoting parts of a ballad. The players enter. Hamlet welcomes an old friend, noting he has grown a beard and remarking on a ""young lady and mistress"" having grown taller. He asks them to perform ""The Murder of Gonzago"" the next night, and also asks the First Player to recite a passionate speech about Priam's slaughter from ""Æneas' tale to Dido."" The First Player delivers the speech, moving Polonius to tears. Hamlet then asks Polonius to ensure the players are well-treated, asserting they are ""the abstract and brief chronicles of the time."" He privately asks the First Player if he could study a speech of ""some dozen or sixteen lines"" that Hamlet would insert into the play.
Alone, Hamlet delivers another soliloquy, chastising himself for his inaction and lack of passion compared to the player, who can weep for Hecuba. He calls himself a ""dull and muddy-mettled rascal,"" a ""coward,"" and ""pigeon-liver'd"" for not avenging his father. He resolves to use the play as a test: ""The play's the thing Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king."" He also acknowledges the possibility that the Ghost he saw might be the devil, abusing his melancholy to damn him, and thus needs ""good grounds More relative than this.""

**ACT III**

**Scene I:** The King and Queen question Rosencrantz and Guildenstern about Hamlet. They report that he admits to distraction but won't reveal the cause, maintaining a ""crafty madness."" They mention Hamlet's enthusiasm for the players and that he has asked the majesties to see a play that night. The King is pleased by this and encourages them to further engage Hamlet in these ""delights."" The King asks Gertrude to leave so he and Polonius can ""closely sent for Hamlet"" to ""affront Ophelia,"" allowing them to ""frankly judge"" if his suffering is due to love. Gertrude expresses hope that Ophelia's beauty will restore Hamlet. Polonius instructs Ophelia to read a book to ""colour Your loneliness"" while he and the King hide. Polonius reflects that ""with devotion's visage And pious action, we do sugar o'er The devil himself,"" a remark that strikes the King's conscience. They withdraw as Hamlet approaches.
Hamlet delivers his famous ""To be, or not to be"" soliloquy, contemplating the pain of life versus the fear of the unknown after death, which ""puzzles the will"" and makes ""cowards of us all."" He sees Ophelia. He asks her to remember his sins in her prayers. Ophelia returns some ""remembrances"" he gave her, but Hamlet denies ever giving them and questions her honesty and fairness, suggesting beauty corrupts honesty. He declares he never loved her and orders her to ""Get thee to a nunnery,"" calling women breeders of sinners and accusing them of artificiality, jiggling, ambling, lisping, and wantonness. He tells her ""I'll no more of't; it hath made me mad."" He declares there will be ""no more marriages: those that are married already, all but one, shall live; the rest shall keep as they are."" Hamlet exits. Ophelia laments Hamlet's ""noble mind"" being ""o'erthrown.""
The King and Polonius emerge, concluding that Hamlet's behavior is not love-madness. The King fears Hamlet's melancholy and decides to send him to England for ""neglected tribute,"" hoping a change of scenery will cure him. Polonius, however, still believes love is the cause and suggests one more attempt: after the play, the Queen should speak ""round with him"" alone, while Polonius hides and listens. If that fails, then Hamlet can be sent to England. The King agrees, stating, ""Madness in great ones must not unwatch'd go.""

**Scene II:** Hamlet instructs the Player on how to deliver a speech naturally, avoiding overacting, ranting, and ad-libbing by clowns. He emphasizes that acting's purpose is to ""hold, as 'twere, the mirror up to nature."" He asks Horatio to join him. Hamlet praises Horatio's steady temperament, telling him he has chosen him as a friend for his ability to endure fortune's ups and downs with equal thanks. He reveals that a scene in the play to be performed tonight mirrors his father's death, and asks Horatio to observe the King's reaction closely, as this will confirm if the Ghost was honest.
The King, Queen, and court enter for the play. Hamlet sits by Ophelia, making bawdy and cynical remarks. He tells her his father died ""these two hours"" ago, then corrects it to ""twice two months,"" sarcastically noting that a great man must ""build churches"" to be remembered for even half a year. The play, ""The Mouse-trap"" (also called ""The Murder of Gonzago""), begins. A Prologue delivers a brief verse. The Player King and Queen enter, professing their deep love and the Queen vowing never to remarry should he die. Hamlet pointedly comments to his mother, ""The lady doth protest too much, methinks."" The Player King falls asleep. Lucianus, the Player King's nephew, enters and pours poison into the sleeper's ear. At this reenactment of his father's murder, King Claudius abruptly rises, cries for ""lights,"" and exits in a state of agitation, followed by the entire court.
Hamlet and Horatio are left alone, convinced by the King's reaction that the Ghost spoke the truth. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern return, reporting the King's ""distemper"" and the Queen's ""great affliction of spirit."" The Queen desires to speak with Hamlet in her closet. Hamlet, seeing their manipulative attempts to uncover his secret, takes a recorder and asks Guildenstern to play it. When Guildenstern says he cannot, Hamlet chastises him, ""Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of me! You would play upon me; you would seem to know my stops... 'Sdeath, do you think I am easier to be played on than a pipe? Call me what instrument you will, though you can fret me, you cannot play upon me."" Polonius enters, again summoning Hamlet to his mother. Hamlet mocks Polonius by making him agree that a cloud looks like a camel, then a weasel, then a whale. After Polonius leaves, Hamlet, alone, reflects on the ""witching time of night"" and his capacity for cruel deeds. He resolves to ""speak daggers"" to his mother but not to physically harm her.

**ACT III (continued - Scene II in the text is actually a new scene after the Queen's chamber)**

**Scene II (King, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern):** The King expresses his unease with Hamlet's madness and declares it unsafe to let him ""range."" He decides to send Hamlet to England immediately, along with Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, with a ""commission"" to ""put fetters upon this fear."" Rosencrantz and Guildenstern pledge their haste.

**Scene III (Polonius, King):** Polonius informs the King that Hamlet is going to his mother's closet and that he will hide ""Behind the arras"" to overhear their conversation, believing the Queen will ""tax him home."" He reiterates that a ""more audience than a mother"" is needed. The King thanks him.

**Scene III (Queen's Chamber):** Polonius instructs the Queen to be firm with Hamlet and then hides behind the arras. Hamlet enters and confronts his mother. Their exchange quickly escalates. Hamlet accuses her of offending his father, while she accuses him of offending his ""father"" (Claudius). When Hamlet states she is his ""husband's brother's wife,"" he implies she has forgotten who she is. Hamlet forces her to sit, declaring he will ""set you up a glass Where you may see the inmost part of you."" The Queen, fearing for her life, cries for help. Polonius, from behind the arras, also cries for help. Hamlet, exclaiming ""How now! a rat? Dead, for a ducat, dead!"", draws his rapier and thrusts it through the arras, killing Polonius, whom he mistook for the King.
The Queen is horrified. Hamlet, upon discovering he has killed Polonius, calls him a ""wretched, rash, intruding fool,"" adding that the deed is ""almost as bad... As kill a king, and marry with his brother."" The Queen is shocked at the accusation of killing a king. Hamlet then harshly lectures his mother, condemning her marriage to Claudius by comparing his late father (Hyperion-like) to Claudius (a ""mildew'd ear,"" a ""cutpurse of the empire,"" a ""vice of kings,"" a ""king Of shreds and patches"").
The Ghost of King Hamlet reappears, visible only to Hamlet. It comes to ""whet thy almost blunted purpose"" and to step between Hamlet and his mother's ""fighting soul."" The Queen believes Hamlet is mad, seeing him speak to ""incorporal air."" Hamlet describes the Ghost's pale glare to his mother, but she sees and hears nothing. As the Ghost exits, Hamlet tells his mother that his pulse is steady, proving he is not mad, and asks her to confess her sins to Heaven, repent, and avoid his uncle's bed. He tells her she must be ""cruel, only to be kind."" He expresses regret for killing Polonius and promises to answer for his death. The Queen exits. Hamlet resolves that ""Thus bad begins, and worse remains behind,"" and exits behind the arras, presumably to dispose of Polonius's body.

**ACT IV**

**Scene I:** The King questions the Queen about Hamlet's sighs and ""profound heaves."" The Queen tells him that Hamlet, in a ""lawless fit,"" killed Polonius, whom he mistook for a rat behind the arras. The King expresses shock and realizes it could have been him. He immediately decides to ship Hamlet to England, knowing he cannot strongly punish Hamlet due to his popularity with the ""distracted multitude."" Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dispatched to find Hamlet and bring Polonius's body to the chapel. The King also plans to consult ""wisest friends"" to ""countenance and excuse"" the vile deed.

**Scene II:** Rosencrantz and Guildenstern find Hamlet, asking where he has hidden Polonius's body. Hamlet riddles, calls Rosencrantz a ""sponge,"" and refuses to give a direct answer, comparing the King to a ""thing--of nothing."" He runs off, still evading their questions.

**Scene III:** The King, hearing Hamlet has been found, demands to know where Polonius is. Hamlet mockingly replies that Polonius is ""at supper,"" being eaten by ""politick worms."" He tells the King to seek Polonius in Heaven, or if not found there, ""i'the other place yourself,"" adding that within a month he will be able to ""nose him"" going up the stairs to the lobby. The King declares Hamlet must leave for England for his ""especial safety."" Hamlet bids farewell to his ""dear mother"" (referring to the King, as ""father and mother is man and wife""). The King, alone, reveals in a soliloquy that he has sent letters to England, ""conjuring to that effect,"" demanding ""The present death of Hamlet.""

**Scene IV:** The Queen tells Horatio she will not speak with Ophelia. Horatio persuades her, saying Ophelia is ""importunate; indeed, distract,"" and might ""strew Dangerous conjectures."" Ophelia enters, singing fragmented, mournful songs about a dead lover. She hands out imaginary flowers—rosemary for remembrance, pansies for thoughts, fennel for flattery, columbines as a ""thankless flower,"" rue (herb of grace) for sorrow and repentance, and a daisy for warning—to the King and Queen, each with symbolic meaning for their situations. She weeps for her father, buried ""in the cold ground,"" and exits, still singing. The King expresses that her madness stems from her father's death, and notes that ""When sorrows come, they come not single spies, But in battalions!""
Marcellus announces that young Laertes has arrived in a ""riotous head,"" leading a crowd crying, ""Laertes shall be king!"" Laertes bursts in, armed, demanding his father from the King. The Queen intercedes. Laertes, full of rage, dismisses the Queen's attempts to calm him and demands to know how his father died. The King tells him Polonius is dead but not by his hand, offering to prove his innocence and help Laertes seek justice. Ophelia re-enters, fantastically dressed with straws and flowers, singing more mad songs. Her deranged state deeply affects Laertes, who weeps. The King, seeing Laertes' grief, once again promises justice.
Bernardo brings letters from Hamlet to the King and Queen. The King reads Hamlet's letter, which states he has been ""set naked on your kingdom"" and will beg leave to see the King tomorrow to explain his ""sudden and more strange return."" Laertes is invigorated by the news, eager for direct revenge. The King proposes a plan: Laertes is renowned for his fencing skill, and Hamlet, being ""remiss,"" will not ""peruse the foils."" Laertes should choose ""a sword unbated"" (unblunted) and, in a ""pass of practice,"" ""Requite him for your father."" Laertes agrees, revealing he has a ""mortal"" poison from a ""mountebank"" with which he will anoint his sword tip, ensuring a scratch means death. The King adds another layer to the plot: if Hamlet survives, he will prepare a ""chalice for the nonce,"" a poisoned drink, for Hamlet to sip from.
The Queen enters, bringing more bad news: Ophelia has drowned. She describes how Ophelia, while making garlands of flowers, fell into a ""weeping brook"" when a bough broke, and her clothes pulled her down to her death. Laertes is overcome with grief but resolves to turn his ""speech of fire"" (rage) into action after his tears are shed.

**ACT V**

**Scene I:** Two clowns (gravediggers) are digging a grave. They debate whether Ophelia should receive a Christian burial, as her death appears to be a suicide, discussing legalistic arguments with humorous logic. The First Clown asserts that ""crowner's-quest law"" allows it because she was a ""gentlewoman."" They discuss Adam's profession and riddle about who builds stronger than a mason or shipwright (a grave-maker, whose houses last till doomsday). The Second Clown leaves to fetch liquor.
Hamlet and Horatio enter, observing the First Clown digging and singing cheerfully while throwing up skulls. Hamlet reflects on the gravedigger's lack of feeling and the universal nature of death. He picks up a skull, realizing it belonged to Yorick, the King's jester, whom he knew and loved as a child. He delivers a poignant reflection on mortality and the transience of life, remembering Yorick's ""infinite jest"" and ""flashes of merriment."" He muses on how Alexander the Great and Imperial Caesar could return to dust and be used for base purposes like stopping a bung-hole or patching a wall.
A funeral procession enters, carrying Ophelia's corpse. Hamlet and Horatio hide. Hamlet notices the ""maimèd rites,"" indicating a doubtful death (suicide). Laertes, the King, Queen, and mourners follow. The First Priest explains that only ""great command"" allowed Ophelia Christian burial, as her death was ""doubtful,"" and she would otherwise have been buried in ""unsanctified"" ground with ""shards, flints, and pebbles"" thrown on her. Laertes is enraged by the limited ceremony, lamenting that ""A ministering angel shall my sister be, When thou liest howling."" The Queen scatters flowers on Ophelia's grave, wishing she had been Hamlet's wife and that she was decking a bride-bed, not a grave. Laertes, in a fit of grief, leaps into the grave, calling for dust to be piled high enough to o'ertop mountains.
Hamlet reveals himself, declaring ""This is I, Hamlet the Dane,"" and leaps into the grave to grapple with Laertes, protesting Laertes' dramatic show of grief. They fight, and the King and Queen order them separated. Hamlet declares his immense love for Ophelia, asserting that ""forty thousand brothers Could not... Make up my sum."" He challenges Laertes to prove his love through weeping, fighting, fasting, or tearing himself. The Queen states Hamlet is mad. Hamlet, still defiant, says, ""The cat will mew, and dog will have his day,"" and exits. The King tells Horatio to wait on Hamlet and reassures Laertes to ""Strengthen your patience in our last night's speech"" (their plot), promising a ""living monument"" for Ophelia.

**Scene II:** Hamlet tells Horatio he regrets his ""madness"" towards Laertes, recognizing in Laertes' grief an ""image of my cause."" Osric, a fop, enters and delivers a message from the King. Hamlet, mocking Osric's affected manners, learns that the King has wagered six Barbary horses against six French rapiers that Hamlet will win a fencing match against Laertes. The terms are that in ""a dozen passes,"" Laertes ""shall not exceed you three hits."" Hamlet accepts the challenge despite a sense of ""gain-giving"" (misgiving) about his heart, but defies ""augury,"" believing in a ""special providence in the fall of a sparrow.""
The court assembles for the fencing match, with the King, Queen, Laertes, Osric, and other attendants present. Hamlet apologizes to Laertes for his recent behavior, attributing it to his madness and hoping Laertes will forgive him as a gentleman. Laertes accepts the apology, stating his ""nature"" is satisfied, but his honor requires him to proceed with the match. They choose foils. The King announces that if Hamlet scores the first or second hit, or quits in answer to the third, he will drink to Hamlet's health and drop ""an union"" (a pearl) into Hamlet's cup. This pearl is secretly poisoned.
The match begins. Hamlet scores the first hit, confirmed by Osric. The King offers Hamlet the poisoned cup, but Hamlet defers, saying he will play ""this bout first."" Hamlet scores a second hit. The Queen then drinks from the cup, despite the King's warning, saying, ""I pray you, pardon me."" The King mutters, ""It is the poison'd cup; it is too late."" Laertes, now conflicted, knows he must hit Hamlet. They play a third bout. Laertes wounds Hamlet with his poisoned rapier. In the ensuing scuffle, they exchange rapiers, and Hamlet wounds Laertes with the same poisoned blade.
The Queen falls back, declaring, ""The drink, the drink! I am poison'd."" Laertes falls, revealing his own treachery: Hamlet is slain by the ""treacherous instrument"" (the poisoned rapier) in his hand, and he himself is ""justly killed with mine own treachery."" He explicitly states, ""Thy mother's poison'd: I can no more: the king, the king's to blame."" Hamlet, realizing the full extent of the plot, plunges the poisoned rapier into the King, forcing him to drink from the poisoned cup, saying, ""Here, thou incestuous, murd'rous, damnèd Dane, Follow my mother."" The King dies. Laertes exchanges forgiveness with Hamlet before he dies.
Hamlet, dying, asks Horatio to live and ""Report me and my cause aright To the unsatisfied."" Horatio, declaring himself ""more an antique Roman than a Dane,"" attempts to drink the remaining poison from the cup to join Hamlet, but Hamlet violently stops him, begging him to tell his story. Hamlet dies, with the final words, ""The rest is silence."" A ""Dead March"" sounds afar off as the curtain descends."
Jane Eyre-Charlotte Brontë,"The provided text details the life and experiences of Jane Eyre from her childhood at Gateshead Hall, through her education and teaching at Lowood Institution, to her time as a governess at Thornfield Hall, and finally to her union with Mr. Rochester and the subsequent years.

**Chapter I:**
The narrator, Jane Eyre, is a young orphan living with her aunt, Mrs. Reed, and cousins Eliza, John, and Georgiana Reed, at Gateshead Hall. On a cold, rainy winter day, Mrs. Reed excludes Jane from the family group in the drawing-room, citing Jane’s unsociable and unchildlike disposition. Jane retreats to a window-seat in the adjoining breakfast-room to read ""Bewick’s History of British Birds,"" finding solace in its bleak imagery. Her cousin John Reed enters, verbally abuses her, and throws the book at her, hitting her head and drawing blood. In a rare outburst, Jane calls John a ""wicked and cruel boy,"" comparing him to a murderer and Roman emperors. John attacks her, prompting Mrs. Reed, Bessie (the nurse), and Abbot (the maid) to intervene. Mrs. Reed, enraged that Jane ""flew at Master John,"" orders her to be taken to the ""red-room"" and locked in as punishment.

**Chapter II:**
Jane resists Bessie and Abbot's attempts to take her to the red-room, a large, rarely used chamber where Mr. Reed had died. They scold her for her ""shocking conduct"" and tell her she is ""less than a servant."" Bessie threatens to tie her down if she does not sit still. Jane complies, feeling the ignominy. Left alone in the red-room, Jane is filled with fear and resentment over the injustice of her treatment at Gateshead. She reflects on her dependency and Mrs. Reed’s broken promise to her deceased uncle to raise Jane as her own. Believing the room to be haunted by Mr. Reed’s spirit, she is terrified when she sees a gleam of light on the wall. She screams and desperately shakes the locked door. Bessie and Abbot return, and Jane cries that she saw a light and thought a ghost would come. Abbot dismisses it as a trick. Mrs. Reed arrives, scolds the servants, and punishes Jane further for her ""artifice"" by forcing her to remain in the red-room for another hour. Jane pleads for mercy but is thrust back in and loses consciousness.

**Chapter III:**
Jane wakes in her own bed in the nursery, disoriented. She sees the apothecary, Mr. Lloyd, examining her. His presence, as a stranger unrelated to the Reeds, brings her a sense of protection. Mr. Lloyd questions her about her illness. Jane reveals she was ""knocked down"" by John and then locked in the red-room, which she believes is haunted by Mr. Reed's ghost. She admits to being miserable due to her lack of family. Mr. Lloyd asks about her relatives, and Jane mentions her aunt once spoke of ""poor, low relations called Eyre."" Jane expresses a desire to leave Gateshead and, when asked, states she would like to go to school. Mr. Lloyd speaks to Mrs. Reed, recommending ""change of air and scene"" for Jane. Jane later overhears Bessie and Abbot discussing her, confirming that her parents died of typhus a year after marrying against her grandfather Reed's wishes, leaving her orphaned and disinherited. Abbot expresses disdain for Jane, wishing she were a ""nice, pretty child."" Jane's hopes for a new life are kindled. A week later, Mr. Lloyd's reply to Miss Temple corroborates Jane's story. Miss Temple publicly clears Jane's name before the entire school. Jane, relieved, applies herself diligently to her studies and quickly advances, learning French and drawing. She finds purpose and contentment in her new life at Lowood.

**Chapter IV:**
As weeks pass at Lowood, Jane regains her health. However, in early spring, a severe typhus fever epidemic strikes the school, sickening forty-five out of eighty girls and turning the institution into a hospital. Mr. Brocklehurst and his family avoid Lowood during this time. The strict housekeeper, Mrs. Harden, leaves, and her more liberal successor improves the food provisions. Jane, among the healthy students, enjoys increased freedom to roam the surrounding moors and woods. She forms a close friendship with Helen Burns, a fellow student who patiently endures Miss Scatcherd's harsh punishments and embodies a philosophy of Christian endurance and forgiveness. Helen suffers from consumption, not typhus, and is moved to Miss Temple's room. Jane, ignorant of the severity of consumption, is only vaguely concerned. One evening, after seeing the surgeon's pony at Lowood, Jane learns from a nurse that Helen is dying. Jane secretly visits Helen that night and finds her composed and serene. Helen speaks of her belief in God and a happy afterlife. Jane falls asleep in Helen's arms. The next morning, Jane is carried back to her dormitory, and soon learns that Helen has died. Helen's grave is marked with ""Resurgam.""

**Chapter X:**
Eight years pass. Jane remains at Lowood, six as a pupil and two as a teacher. The typhus epidemic led to public scrutiny and reforms at Lowood: a new building, better diet, and a governing committee. Mr. Brocklehurst retains his treasury post but with less power. Jane flourishes, becoming the first girl in her class and then a respected teacher. However, her solace, Miss Temple, marries and moves away, leaving Jane feeling a void and a renewed longing for liberty and change. Jane secretly advertises for a governess position and receives one offer from a Mrs. Fairfax of Thornfield, near Millcote, for thirty pounds a year to teach one pupil. Mrs. Reed, contacted for a reference, replies that Jane ""might do as she pleased."" Jane receives a positive testimonial from Lowood. Before leaving, she is visited by Bessie, who is now married to Robert Leaven and has children. Bessie updates Jane on the Reed family: John Reed has died, reportedly by suicide, after ruining himself and his family; Mrs. Reed suffered a stroke and is very ill. Bessie also reveals that Jane's paternal uncle, Mr. Eyre from Madeira, visited Gateshead seven years ago, wanting to adopt Jane, but Mrs. Reed turned him away. Jane leaves Lowood, heading for Thornfield Hall.

**Chapter XI:**
Jane arrives in Millcote late at night and is met by a servant who drives her to Thornfield Hall, six miles away. She is surprised by Mrs. Fairfax, who, contrary to Jane's expectations of a stately mistress, is a kind, elderly housekeeper, distantly related to the Rochesters. Mrs. Fairfax explains that Mr. Rochester owns Thornfield and that Adèle Varens, Jane's pupil, is his ward. Adèle and her French nurse, Sophie, soon appear. Adèle, a lively French child, speaks of her past life with her mother, Céline Varens, a French opera-dancer, and her journey with Mr. Rochester. Jane begins teaching Adèle in the library. Mrs. Fairfax gives Jane a tour of the grand old house, including the unused third-story rooms. Jane hears a strange, mirthless laugh from the third floor, which Mrs. Fairfax attributes to Grace Poole, a servant who works and lives in that area. Jane finds Grace Poole to be a hard-featured, plain woman, and is puzzled by the laugh and Grace's unusual position.

**Chapter XII:**
Jane settles into Thornfield. Adèle becomes more obedient, and Jane develops affection for her and Mrs. Fairfax. Despite the comfort, Jane feels a deep restlessness and longing for a wider experience. She continues to hear Grace Poole's strange laugh and murmurs from the third storey. Jane overhears servants discussing Grace Poole's high wages and indispensability, hinting at a secret. One afternoon, Jane walks to Hay to post a letter for Mrs. Fairfax. On her return, she encounters a horseman and his dog. The horse slips on ice, throwing the rider. Jane helps the man, who is brusque but compelling. She later discovers this man is Mr. Rochester, the master of Thornfield Hall, who has just returned.

**Chapter XIII:**
Mr. Rochester, recovering from his sprained ankle, keeps Jane and Adèle at a distance, busy with his business callers. He sends for them to join him for tea. Jane, despite Mrs. Fairfax's suggestion of formality, attends in her usual simple attire. Mr. Rochester is stern but engages Jane in conversation. He comments on her unusual appearance and intelligence. He shows her his portfolio of drawings, which are imaginative and dark, asking about the inspiration behind them. Jane admits to finding great pleasure in creating them. He then abruptly dismisses her and Adèle. Mrs. Fairfax reveals details about Mr. Rochester's past: he inherited Thornfield after his elder brother's death and had a troubled history, including ""misunderstandings"" with his father and brother. That night, Jane is awakened by a ""demoniac laugh"" and a struggle outside her door. She smells smoke and discovers Mr. Rochester's bed curtains are on fire. She quickly extinguishes the flames, drenching Mr. Rochester. He wakes, confused, and reveals he was attacked. He instructs Jane to tell no one and attributes the incident to Grace Poole, whom he then goes to confront upstairs. He returns, pale and gloomy, confirming it was Grace Poole but insists Jane keep silent and he will account for it. He expresses gratitude to Jane for saving his life.

**Chapter XIV:**
The next morning, Jane observes Grace Poole calmly sewing new curtains in Mr. Rochester's room, showing no signs of guilt, which baffles Jane. Grace offers a plausible but false explanation for the fire. Jane, testing Grace, asks more questions, making Grace subtly suspicious of Jane's knowledge. Jane's indignation at Grace's apparent impunity is tempered by her desire for self-preservation. Jane deduces a mysterious hold Grace Poole has over Mr. Rochester. Later, Mrs. Fairfax informs Jane that Mr. Rochester has left to attend a party at the Eshton's estate, ""The Leas,"" and is expected to stay for a week or more. She mentions the beautiful and accomplished Blanche Ingram, whom Mr. Rochester is expected to marry. Jane is devastated by this news, realizing her growing love for Mr. Rochester has been foolish. She resolves to crush her feelings by drawing her own ""plain"" portrait and a beautiful miniature of Blanche Ingram, to remind herself of their differing stations.

**Chapter XV:**
Mr. Rochester later explains the story of Adèle's parentage. She is the daughter of Céline Varens, a French opera-dancer with whom he had a ""grande passion."" He discovered Céline's infidelity and mercenary nature and ended their relationship. Though Adèle is not his biological daughter, he took her in out of charity after her mother abandoned her. He reveals he feigned courtship of Miss Ingram to make Jane jealous and to test her feelings. He confirms his love for Jane and proposes marriage. Jane, overwhelmed, initially resists, reminding him of their social disparity and his engagement to Miss Ingram. He insists he has no love for Miss Ingram and has already discredited himself to her to expose her true, mercenary character. Jane confesses her love for him. A violent thunderstorm breaks out as they embrace. Lightning strikes the old chestnut tree in the orchard, splitting it in two. Mrs. Fairfax witnesses their embrace and is shocked. Mr. Rochester quickly takes Jane indoors, telling Mrs. Fairfax they will be married in four weeks.

**Chapter XXV:**
On the eve of her wedding, Jane is preparing to leave Thornfield. She is unsettled by the ""ghostly"" wedding attire and an unexplained event from the previous night. She walks in the orchard, observing the split chestnut tree, which she sees as a symbol of their bond, though fractured. She feels a sense of foreboding. Later that night, while waiting for Mr. Rochester's return from a business trip, she is awakened by a ""savage, shrilly sound"" and a struggle from the third story, followed by a call for ""Rochester!"" Mr. Rochester calms the alarmed guests by claiming it was a servant's nightmare. He then secretly enlists Jane's help. He leads her to a hidden room on the third floor, where she finds Mr. Mason, a guest, gravely wounded and bleeding. Mr. Rochester reveals Mason was bitten and stabbed by his mad wife, Bertha Mason, whom he keeps locked in the hidden room, attended by Grace Poole. He forces Jane to tend to Mason while he fetches a surgeon. Jane is horrified but obeys. Mr. Rochester returns with Mr. Carter, the surgeon. Mason reveals Bertha bit him like a ""tigress"" and sucked his blood. Mr. Rochester administers a cordial and sends Mason away by chaise. He takes Jane to the orchard, where he explains his tragic marriage to Bertha Mason in Jamaica, a union arranged by his father for money, only to discover Bertha's inherent madness and depravity. He explains his attempt to live with mistresses after being unable to divorce Bertha. He confesses his love for Jane, saying she is his only hope for a ""higher and worthier existence."" He proposes they live together as husband and wife, but in a ""secure sanctuary"" in the south of France, away from Thornfield. Jane, though loving him, refuses to be his mistress, affirming her adherence to moral law. She believes she must leave him. That night, a mysterious voice calls ""Jane! Jane! Jane!"" which Jane recognizes as Mr. Rochester's. She believes it is a supernatural summons.

**Chapter XXVI:**
On the wedding morning, as Jane prepares, the ceremony is interrupted at the church. A solicitor, Mr. Briggs, reveals that Mr. Rochester is already married to Bertha Mason, who is still alive and residing at Thornfield. Mr. Mason, Bertha's brother, is produced as a witness. Mr. Rochester, enraged, admits the truth, calling Bertha his ""wife"" and a ""hideous demon."" He leads everyone back to Thornfield Hall, where he unveils Bertha Mason, a wild, corpulent, and terrifying madwoman, who attacks him. He binds her, then confronts the guests, inviting them to judge his situation. Mr. Briggs explains that Jane's uncle, Mr. Eyre of Madeira, who is now ill, had learned of Jane's impending marriage from Mr. Mason and sent him to prevent it, having intended to adopt Jane and leave her his fortune. Jane, devastated by the deception and the revelation of Bertha, retreats to her room. She realizes her love for Mr. Rochester is tainted and that she must leave him. She tells Mr. Rochester she cannot be his mistress. He pleads with her, offering her his hand and all his possessions, insisting he wants to marry her and that she is his ""equal."" Jane, though loving him, refuses to live with him outside of marriage, citing her principles and self-respect. She asserts her freedom and independent will. After an agonizing struggle, she leaves Thornfield in the dead of night, with only a small amount of money, walking away to an unknown future.

**Chapter XXVIII:**
After two days of wandering and starvation, Jane is left penniless at Whitcross, a desolate moorland crossing. She finds temporary shelter on the moor and, after a night of prayer and reflection, resolves to seek work. She is repeatedly refused shelter and food in a nearby village due to her appearance and lack of references. Close to death from hunger and exhaustion, she stumbles upon a small cottage, Moor House, where she is found by Mr. St. John Rivers and his two sisters, Diana and Mary. St. John, a clergyman, brings her inside despite the housekeeper Hannah's suspicions. The sisters, seeing her dire state, offer her food and shelter. Jane, giving the alias Jane Elliott, refuses to disclose her past, fearing discovery. The Rivers family, though compassionate, are intrigued by her.

**Chapter XXIX:**
Jane slowly recovers at Moor House, nursed by Diana and Mary. St. John, though observing her keenly, initially remains reserved. Jane enjoys the intellectual companionship of Diana and Mary and helps with household chores and gooseberry picking. She learns about the Rivers family: their father, the old Mr. Rivers, has recently died, and they are struggling financially. Their uncle, John Eyre, has died and left his entire fortune to an unknown relative, with only thirty guineas for the Rivers siblings. St. John, initially cold towards Jane, reveals his ambition to be a missionary in India. Jane then realizes that St. John, Diana, and Mary are her cousins, as her father was Mr. Rivers's mother's brother. Jane, joyful at finding family, insists on dividing her inheritance (which she discovers is twenty thousand pounds from her uncle John Eyre) equally among the four cousins, giving each five thousand pounds. St. John and his sisters initially resist, but eventually, through arbitration, Jane's will is granted.

**Chapter XXX:**
Jane closes Morton school (where she has become a much-loved schoolmistress) for the holidays and eagerly begins transforming Moor House for Diana and Mary's return, demonstrating her domestic skills and finding joy in her new family connections. St. John, though acknowledging her efforts, remains detached, confirming Jane's earlier assessment of him as a ""cold cumbrous column"" more suited to a missionary's life than domesticity. Diana and Mary return, expressing delight with the renovated home and Jane's warm welcome. St. John soon announces his definite departure for India, and during a walk, he asks Jane to accompany him as his wife, arguing that she is ""formed for labour, not for love"" and would be an invaluable ""helpmeet"" for his mission. Jane is deeply troubled, realizing he does not love her in a spousal way and that such a marriage would sacrifice her true nature. She struggles with his powerful will, feeling a strong ""veneration"" for his character but resisting his demand for her entire self. She ultimately refuses to marry him, offering to go only as his fellow-missionary or curate. St. John is angered by her refusal, seeing it as a denial of God's will.

**Chapter XXXV:**
St. John delays his departure for a week, during which he inflicts ""refined, lingering torture"" on Jane through his coldness and disapproval, making her feel outcast. He constantly reminds her of her ""offence."" One evening, Jane makes a final attempt to reconcile with him, but he remains unmoved, reiterating his intention to go to India and asking if she will not marry him. Jane firmly refuses, saying he doesn't love her and would ""kill me"" if she married him. She offers again to go as his assistant, but he rejects the idea of an unmarried female curate. He then accuses her of loving Mr. Rochester. Jane admits this by her silence, confirming his suspicion that her heart ""clings"" to an ""unconsecrated"" interest. He leaves, reiterating his prayer that she ""may not indeed become a castaway."" Diana, knowing St. John has proposed, expresses her concern for Jane's well-being and her unsuitability for a missionary's life. She acknowledges Jane does not love St. John. Jane, meanwhile, is torn by St. John's powerful influence. Just as she is about to yield to his will, she hears a mysterious, urgent voice calling her name, ""Jane! Jane! Jane!"" She recognizes it as Mr. Rochester's voice. Feeling it is a divine summons, she breaks from St. John, asserting her independence, and resolves to find Mr. Rochester.

**Chapter XXXVI:**
St. John leaves a note for Jane, urging her to ""watch and pray"" and reconsider his offer. Jane, however, is determined to find Mr. Rochester. She announces to Diana and Mary that she is going on a journey. She travels back to Whitcross, then continues towards Thornfield, where she sees the Hall is a ""blackened ruin,"" destroyed by fire. She returns to the local inn and learns from the host (Mr. Rochester's former butler) that Thornfield Hall burned down in the autumn. The fire was started by Bertha Mason, Mr. Rochester's mad wife, who had escaped her confinement (due to Grace Poole's inattention). Bertha set fire to the house and then threw herself from the roof, dying instantly. Mr. Rochester, after ensuring all the servants were safe, had tried to rescue Bertha. In doing so, he sustained severe injuries: he lost an eye and a hand, and became completely blind. He now lives as a ""cripple"" at Ferndean, a desolate manor-house, attended only by old John and his wife. Jane immediately hires a chaise to go to him.

**Chapter XXXVII:**
Jane arrives at Ferndean in the evening. She sees Mr. Rochester, now blind and with one arm mutilated, emerging from the house. He is a brooding, desperate figure. He struggles to navigate his surroundings, reliant on John for guidance. Jane, unseen, observes him, feeling a mix of pain and hope. She then enters the house and, without revealing her name, tells John's wife, Mary, that she has come to see Mr. Rochester. Mr. Rochester, who has been living in isolation and despair, rings for candles and water. Jane carries the tray into the parlor. Pilot, Mr. Rochester's dog, recognizes her. Mr. Rochester, unable to see, asks who is there. Jane speaks, and he recognizes her voice. He reaches out, grasps her hand, then embraces her, overwhelmed with emotion, questioning if she is real or a dream. Jane assures him she is real and has returned to him. She reveals her uncle in Madeira is dead and has left her five thousand pounds, making her an ""independent woman."" She tells Mr. Rochester she will stay with him as his companion, eyes, and hands. He is initially reserved but slowly opens up. Jane, teasing him about his appearance, begins to restore his spirits. He asks her to marry him, accepting his infirmities. Jane joyfully accepts, affirming her love for him and her delight in being useful to him. Mr. Rochester confesses that God's ""chastisements"" (his suffering) have humbled him, leading him to remorse and repentance, and he now sees God's hand in his doom. He recounts his desperate prayer for Jane's return, and how he heard her voice calling to him at midnight. Jane confirms she heard his call at the same time and replied to it. He thanks God for her return and for tempering judgment with mercy.

**Chapter XXXVIII (Conclusion):**
Jane marries Mr. Rochester in a quiet ceremony with only the parson and clerk present. She informs John and Mary at Ferndean, who are pleased. She writes to Diana and Mary Rivers, who approve of her marriage. St. John Rivers, however, does not reply to her letter, though he later maintains a correspondence. Jane soon brings Adèle from her strict school to live with them, finding her a pleasing companion. Ten years pass. Jane and Mr. Rochester live in complete happiness and concord. Mr. Rochester remains blind for the first two years of their marriage, with Jane serving as his ""vision"" and ""right hand,"" describing the world to him and reading to him. At the end of two years, he recovers sight in one eye, enabling him to discern light and shape, though not distinctly.

Madame Bovary-Gustave Flaubert,"The narrative begins with the introduction of Charles Bovary, a new and awkward fifteen-year-old student, at school. His unusual cap and stammered name, which sounds like ""Charbovari,"" cause widespread laughter and punishment from the master. Despite his initial discomfort, Charles applies himself diligently to his studies.

His background is then detailed: his father, Monsieur Charles Denis Bartolome Bovary, a former assistant-surgeon-major, was compromised in conscription scandals and forced to leave service. He married a hosier's daughter for her sixty thousand franc dowry, but squandered the fortune on extravagant living. Charles's mother, initially loving, grew bitter due to her husband's philandering and irresponsibility, taking over the household management while he idled. Charles, their son, was spoiled in childhood and received irregular, insufficient education from the local curé. At sixteen, he was sent to school in Rouen, where he was an average student. His parents later withdrew him to study medicine. Initially overwhelmed by the curriculum, he eventually became idle, frequenting public-houses and pursuing casual relationships. He failed his first examination but passed a subsequent one after intense cramming.

Charles set up his medical practice in Tostes, succeeding a deceased doctor. His mother then arranged his marriage to Madame Dubuc, a forty-five-year-old widow with a twelve hundred franc income, despite her unattractive appearance. Charles hoped for an easier life, but his wife was controlling, dictating his behavior, managing his finances, and showing constant jealousy and complaints about her health.

One night, Charles is called to the Bertaux farm to treat Monsieur Rouault, a prosperous farmer, for a broken leg. There, he meets Emma, Monsieur Rouault’s daughter, who helps manage the farm. Charles is captivated by Emma’s delicate hands and candid eyes. He treats the simple fracture and begins to visit the farm frequently, enjoying Emma's company. His wife, Heloise, becomes intensely jealous, making allusions and open criticisms of Emma's background, leading Charles to reluctantly cease his visits. Soon after, it is discovered that Heloise's supposed fortune was largely fabricated, with a notary absconding with funds and her property heavily mortgaged. Charles's father, enraged by the deception, blames his wife for Charles's marriage. A week later, Heloise suffers a hemorrhage and dies suddenly. Charles is left in a sorrowful reverie, realizing her love for him.

After Heloise's death, old Rouault visits Charles, offering condolences and inviting him back to the Bertaux, implying Emma misses him. Charles accepts, finding solace in the visits and a naive sense of freedom in his independence. He resolves to propose to Emma. Old Rouault, facing his own financial troubles, readily agrees to the match, and Emma signals her acceptance by opening a shutter. The wedding is set for the following spring, after Charles's period of mourning. Emma meticulously prepares her trousseau, though she had dreamed of a more romantic, torch-lit wedding, which her father dismissed. The wedding is a large, sixteen-hour affair with many guests, abundant food, and lively entertainment. Charles, though quiet, is openly affectionate with Emma the next day, calling her ""my wife."" Two days later, they depart for Tostes, with old Rouault experiencing a wave of nostalgia and sadness upon their departure.

In Tostes, Emma immediately begins redecorating Charles's house, making it more elegant, and Charles buys her a dogcart. Charles is completely enamored with Emma, finding joy in every detail of her presence and believing himself to be the happiest of men. Emma, however, feels a profound sense of disillusionment, questioning if she truly loved Charles and longing for the ""felicity, passion, rapture"" she had read about in books. Her past is explored, revealing a childhood steeped in romantic novels and a convent education that fostered a desire for excitement and grand emotions, rather than the mundane realities of country life. She felt herself destined for something more, a ""wondrous passion"" that Charles's calm, commonplace nature could not provide.

Emma grows increasingly bored and irritated by Charles's lack of ambition, his coarse habits, and the provincial mediocrity of their life. She retreats into her dreams, poring over Parisian journals and novels, imagining a life of luxury and passion. She becomes capricious and neglects her household. Her relationship with Charles's mother, who critiques Emma's spending and ""fine ways,"" becomes strained, leading to arguments. Emma suffers from palpitations, fits of temper, and fainting spells. Charles, attributing her illness to the environment, decides to move to Yonville-l’Abbaye, a market town where a doctor has recently left. Emma, while tidying, finds her old wedding bouquet and burns it, symbolizing the end of her past illusions. They leave Tostes, with Emma pregnant.

In Yonville, a detailed description of the town reveals its provincial stagnation, from the notary's house to the chemist's shop of Monsieur Homais. Homais, a self-important and talkative figure, is introduced, along with Binet, the punctual tax-collector. Charles and Emma arrive, and Homais, eager to curry favor due to his own past legal issues regarding practicing medicine without a diploma, immediately befriends Charles. He offers advice and gifts. Emma and Léon Dupuis, a notary's clerk, meet and discover a shared sensibility, bonding over conversations about nature, music, and literature, and their mutual boredom with Yonville. Léon is captivated by Emma.

Emma gives birth to a girl, Berthe, causing her to faint in disappointment, as she had hoped for a son. She struggles to name the child, eventually settling on Berthe after a name she heard at Vaubyessard. Homais becomes godfather, offering pharmaceutical products as gifts. A chaotic baptism dinner ensues, where Charles's father baptizes Berthe with champagne, angering the curé. Charles's father flirts with Emma, alarming his wife who then orchestrates their departure. Emma, restless, visits Berthe, who is being nursed by the carpenter's wife, Mere Rollet. Léon accompanies her, and their walk by the river deepens their connection, though Léon is too timid to act on his feelings. Emma feels a growing passion for Léon but is also restrained by pride and shame.

Emma's dissatisfaction intensifies. She sees Charles as an obstacle to her happiness and directs her hatred and frustration towards him. She fantasizes about a more exciting life with Léon. Her behavior changes; she feigns piety and domesticity, even bringing Berthe home to showcase a maternal side. Léon is confused by her mixed signals and begins to lose hope, placing her on an ""extraordinary pinnacle."" Emma, however, is consumed by internal desires and resentment. She suffers from fainting spells and spitting blood, which Charles attributes to nervousness. Charles, desperate to cure her, agrees to Homais's suggestion for him to perform an experimental surgery on Hippolyte, the club-footed stable-boy, to gain fame and money. Emma encourages this, eager for Charles's success to reflect well on her.

Charles, after studying, operates on Hippolyte, cutting his Achilles tendon. The operation initially seems successful, and Homais writes a self-aggrandizing article for the local paper, praising Charles. However, Hippolyte's condition rapidly deteriorates; gangrene sets in. Charles is forced to call in a renowned surgeon, Monsieur Canivet, who scorns Charles's botched procedure and amputates Hippolyte's leg. Charles is devastated and humiliated. Emma is furious, not for Charles's failure, but for her own misplaced hope in his mediocrity. She lashes out at him, smashing a barometer. That evening, Rodolphe Boulanger, the wealthy landowner, visits and finds Emma waiting for him. They embrace, their affair rekindled.

Emma and Rodolphe continue their secret rendezvous, with Emma becoming more brazen. She wants to elope with him, imagining a life of passion and luxury in exotic lands. Rodolphe, however, is reluctant to take on a child or the responsibilities of a serious commitment. He delays their departure repeatedly. Meanwhile, Emma's financial affairs spiral out of control. She signs numerous bills with Lheureux, the draper and moneylender, to fund her extravagant purchases and desires. She also sells a small property without Charles's knowledge. Her debts rapidly mount.

Rodolphe eventually writes Emma a letter, hidden in a basket of apricots, ending their affair. He claims he cannot bring misery into her life and must sacrifice himself by exile. Emma, upon reading the letter, is devastated. Overwhelmed with despair, she contemplates suicide, going to the attic window and feeling drawn to the abyss, but Charles's voice pulls her back. She returns downstairs, tries to eat, and then, upon seeing Rodolphe's tilbury pass by, she collapses, recognizing him. She falls into a brain fever. Charles, distraught, nurses her for weeks, calling in doctors, including his old master, Dr. Lariviere, who pronounces her case hopeless.

During her illness, Emma experiences a religious conversion, believing she will become a saint. She embraces Christian humility, praying and engaging in charity, sewing clothes for the poor and bringing Berthe home. Her mother-in-law, who briefly returns, attributes Emma's change to her illness. However, Emma's piety is also a means of masking her internal turmoil and her continued longing for a passionate life. She receives more summonses for unpaid debts. She attempts to get money from Léon, who is now a notary's clerk in Rouen. He is timid and unsuccessful in finding the large sum she needs. She then tries to persuade Monsieur Guillaumin, the Yonville notary, who attempts to seduce her in exchange for assistance. Emma furiously rejects him, feeling further violated and isolated. She then approaches Binet, the tax-collector, who is working on his lathe, but he is repulsed by her desperate advances.

In utter despair and feeling lost, Emma remembers Rodolphe's supposed generosity and sets off for his château, La Huchette. She confronts him, confessing her love and despair, and begs him for three thousand francs to save her from financial ruin. Rodolphe calmly tells her he does not have the money. Emma is enraged, pointing out his luxurious possessions and accusing him of never truly loving her, of having ruined her life. She throws his cufflinks away in fury. Rodolphe remains impassive, stating, ""I haven't got them."" Emma flees, consumed by a whirlwind of emotions, feeling madness approaching.

Driven by a desperate impulse, Emma runs to Homais's chemist shop, sneaks into his private laboratory (""Capharnaum""), and takes a jar of arsenic, which she immediately consumes. Justin, Homais's apprentice, witnesses her act and cries out, but Emma silences him, threatening to blame Homais. She returns home, feeling a false serenity.

Charles, returning home, is distraught by the news of the impending distraint. Emma writes a letter, seals it, and tells Charles to read it tomorrow, refusing to answer any questions. She lies in bed, feeling the poison take effect. She experiences a bitter taste, thirst, sickness, and coldness spreading through her body. At eight o'clock, she begins vomiting blood. Charles notices white sediment in the basin. She denies poisoning herself. She is seized with convulsions and screams. Charles reads her letter, which says, ""Accuse no one."" He realizes she is poisoned and cries for help.

Doctors Canivet and Lariviere are summoned. Dr. Lariviere, a renowned and respected surgeon, immediately recognizes the gravity of the situation and tells Charles there is nothing more to be done. Homais tries to assert his medical knowledge and offers breakfast to the doctors. Charles is consumed by grief. Emma asks for her child, Berthe, who is brought to her. Berthe innocently remarks on her mother's appearance, then asks about her missing stocking, reminding Emma of her betrayals. Emma turns her head away in loathing. Emma experiences extreme pain and convulsions, rejecting Charles's attempts to help her drink.

As she is dying, the blind man's song, ""Maids in the warmth of a summer day / Dream of love, and of love always,"" is heard outside. Emma raises herself, fixed, staring, and laughs an ""atrocious, frantic, despairing laugh,"" before falling back dead.

A state of shock follows Emma's death. Charles is inconsolable. Homais quickly invents a story that Emma mistook arsenic for sugar. He consoles Charles and helps with funeral arrangements. Charles, in his grief, insists Emma be buried in her wedding dress with a wreath and her hair spread out, in three coffins. Homais and the curé, present at the wake, engage in theological and philosophical arguments, occasionally falling asleep. Charles, drawn to Emma's body, tries to revive her with magnetism. Charles's mother arrives, and they quarrel over funeral expenses. Homais cuts a lock of Emma's hair for Charles. The undertaker's men arrive, and Charles endures the hammering of the coffin. Old Rouault arrives and faints at the sight of the black cloth.

Old Rouault, having received the news late and ambiguously, rushes to Yonville in anguish, suffering hallucinations. At the funeral, he and Charles sit side-by-side. Charles is filled with rage, then resignation, feeling a ""vague satisfaction that it was all over."" Hippolyte, with his new wooden leg, attends the funeral. Charles throws a five-franc piece at a chorister. At the cemetery, the coffin is lowered, and Charles throws earth on it, crying ""Adieu!"" He is led away, calmer. Old Rouault, too, departs, promising Charles a turkey. Charles's mother moves in with him.

Money troubles persist for Charles. Lheureux continues to press him for debts, some of which Emma had incurred with false receipts. Félicité, the servant, eventually runs away with Theodore, stealing the remaining clothes. Charles receives news of Léon's marriage. One day, he finds Rodolphe's letter, confirming Emma's affair, but Charles, shrinking from the truth, chooses to believe it was a platonic love. He becomes consumed by a mournful, idealised love for Emma, adopting her tastes and habits, even as he is forced to sell off their possessions. Their daughter, Berthe, is poorly cared for and often sad.

Homais, meanwhile, flourishes. He wages a campaign against the blind man through newspaper articles, eventually having him confined to an asylum. This success emboldens Homais, who uses his journalism to promote his own views and attack rivals. He writes a book, expands his business, and covets the Legion of Honor. Charles and Homais travel to Rouen to choose a mausoleum for Emma, on which Homais suggests the inscription ""Tread upon a loving wife."" Charles is forgetting Emma, though he dreams of her decaying in his arms.

Eventually, Charles meets Rodolphe at a market. Charles gazes at Rodolphe, seeing something of Emma in him, and wishes he could have been that man. A moment of dark fury passes over Charles, but then he resigns himself, saying, ""I don't blame you,"" and attributing everything to ""fatality."" The next day, Berthe finds Charles dead in the arbor, a long tress of Emma's black hair in his hand. A post-mortem finds nothing.

After all their possessions are sold, the remaining money is used to send Berthe to her grandmother. The grandmother dies, old Rouault is paralyzed, and Berthe is sent to an aunt who makes her work in a cotton-factory. In Yonville, three doctors fail to succeed due to Homais's relentless attacks. Homais gains an enormous practice, is respected by authorities, and receives the cross of the Legion of Honor."
Mrs. Dalloway-Virginia Woolf,"Clarissa Dalloway, a fifty-two-year-old woman recovering from an illness, begins her day by deciding to buy flowers herself for a party she is hosting that evening. Her maid, Lucy, is busy preparing their Westminster home for the event, which includes removing doors from their hinges for a smoother flow. As Clarissa walks through London, she reflects on her youth at Bourton, recalling her vibrant past and memories of Peter Walsh, an old suitor. She remembers Peter's distinctive personality, his criticisms, and his eventual marriage to a woman in India. Clarissa contrasts her choice to marry Richard Dalloway, which offered her independence, with Peter's passionate intensity, which she felt would have ""destroyed"" them both.

Clarissa encounters Hugh Whitbread, an old friend, who informs her his wife, Evelyn, is ill. Clarissa feels a familiar sense of inadequacy beside Hugh, but also a quiet attachment. She visits a bookshop, seeking a gift for Evelyn, but finds nothing suitable. She reflects on her own self-perception, feeling both young and aged, and questions the superficiality of her life, including her parties. She acknowledges a deep-seated hatred for Miss Kilman, her daughter Elizabeth's religious and impoverished tutor, viewing her as a ""brutal monster"" who threatens her daughter's soul and privacy.

Meanwhile, Septimus Warren Smith, a shell-shocked war veteran, is in Regent's Park with his young Italian wife, Lucrezia (Rezia). They witness a motor car with drawn blinds stop, sparking rumors of royalty being inside. Septimus, already suffering from severe mental distress, interprets the event as a terrifying personal sign. He hallucinates that the world is about to burst into flames and feels he is blocking the way. Rezia, desperate and exhausted by his condition, tries to make him engage with reality as advised by Dr. Holmes, their general practitioner. Septimus, however, sees the world through a lens of delusion: an aeroplane writing ""messages"" in the sky, sparrows singing in Greek about ""no crime"" and ""no death,"" and his dead friend Evans appearing. Rezia, unable to cope, momentarily wishes him dead.

Back at Clarissa's home, Richard Dalloway arrives unexpectedly from a lunch with Lady Bruton, holding a bunch of red and white roses. He had intended to tell Clarissa he loved her, but cannot bring himself to say the words. Clarissa receives the flowers, understanding his unspoken sentiment. They discuss Peter's unexpected return and his announcement that he is in love with a married woman in India and is seeking a divorce. Clarissa initially feels a pang of regret, briefly imagining a life with Peter, but quickly reaffirms her current life. Richard leaves for a committee meeting, and Clarissa, reflecting on his ""divine simplicity,"" feels a sudden, inexplicable unhappiness, which she identifies as the unjust criticism of her parties by both Peter and Richard.

Elizabeth Dalloway enters, a quiet, serious young woman with an ""Oriental mystery"" about her. Miss Kilman, her tutor, is listening at the door. Miss Kilman, bitter about her past and social standing, harbors a profound hatred for Clarissa, whom she sees as vain and superficial. She desires a ""religious victory"" over Clarissa, to make her ""weep; could ruin her; humiliate her."" Clarissa, in turn, finds Miss Kilman ""detestable"" and fears her influence over Elizabeth. Elizabeth and Miss Kilman go out for tea. In the tea shop, Miss Kilman's deep-seated resentments and desires are revealed, particularly her possessive love for Elizabeth and her frustration with her own life. Elizabeth, feeling stifled, eventually leaves Miss Kilman, who is ""stricken"" by her departure and retreats to Westminster Abbey to pray.

Septimus and Rezia go to their appointment with Sir William Bradshaw, an eminent psychiatrist. Sir William quickly diagnoses Septimus with a ""complete breakdown"" and recommends a long rest in a country home, separating him from Rezia. Septimus perceives Bradshaw and Holmes as agents of ""human nature,"" a ""repulsive brute"" that seeks to control him and strip him of his ""truth"" about universal love and the absence of death. He realizes he is trapped and plans to escape. Rezia is distraught, feeling deserted and betrayed by Sir William, whom she now dislikes.

As the day progresses, Peter Walsh is also wandering through London. He reflects on his past with Clarissa, his perceived failures, and his present love for Daisy. He encounters a street singer, an old woman whose song about enduring love and loss deeply affects Rezia, making her momentarily hopeful. Peter eventually decides to attend Clarissa's party, curious about her life and still seeking a connection.

Back in Septimus and Rezia's lodgings, Septimus momentarily finds joy in helping Rezia trim a hat for Mrs. Peters, speaking normally and laughing for the first time in days. This shared moment of intimacy makes Rezia deeply happy. However, the arrival of a newspaper and the sounds of a child playing trigger Septimus's terror of being alone forever. Rezia tries to reassure him, recalling their shared past and her enduring love. Septimus, seeing his writings about his ""messages from the dead"" and ""universal love,"" cries ""Burn them!"" Rezia protects the papers, pledging to stay with him. Hearing Dr. Holmes approach, Septimus knows he will be taken to the home. Rather than submit, he throws himself out of the window, dying instantly on the area railings. Dr. Holmes, bursting in, dismisses it as a ""sudden impulse"" and calls Septimus a ""coward."" Rezia, in a dazed state, finds a strange peace and clarity, recalling happy memories as she acknowledges his death.

At Clarissa's party, guests arrive, including Sally Seton (now Lady Rosseter), who is warm and effusive. Peter Walsh attends, and he and Sally reflect on their shared past with Clarissa, their criticisms of her choices, and their own lives. Richard and Elizabeth Dalloway are also present. Lady Bradshaw, Sir William's wife, arrives late and discreetly informs Clarissa that ""a young man... had killed himself.""

Clarissa retreats to a small room, profoundly affected by the news of the young man's suicide. She experiences a visceral understanding of his death, visualizing his fall. She questions why the Bradshaws would speak of such a thing at her party. She connects his death to her own horror of death and the ""impossibility of reaching the centre"" in life. She feels his death is an act of defiance, an attempt to communicate. She realizes that men like Sir William Bradshaw, with their imposing ""proportion"" and desire for conversion, make life ""intolerable."" She senses a kinship with the young man, feeling ""somehow very like him,"" and is ""glad that he had done it; thrown it away,"" finding beauty and fun in his act of defiance. The clock strikes the hour, and the ""leaden circles dissolved in the air."" Clarissa resolves to return to her party, to find Sally and Peter, and ""assemble.""

Peter, sitting with Sally, wonders ""Where's Clarissa?"" as Clarissa reappears. He is filled with ""extraordinary excitement"" and realizes, ""It is Clarissa."" The novel concludes with Clarissa's presence."
Pride and Prejudice-Jane Austen,"The story begins with the universally acknowledged truth that a single man of good fortune must be in want of a wife. Mrs. Bennet, upon hearing that the wealthy Mr. Bingley has rented Netherfield Park, immediately schemes to marry him to one of her five daughters. Despite her husband, Mr. Bennet's, playful resistance and sarcastic remarks, he secretly visits Mr. Bingley.

Mr. Bennet later reveals his visit, much to his wife's joy. The family speculates about Bingley's return visit and an upcoming assembly. Lady Lucas, a neighbor, reports favorably on Bingley, describing him as handsome and agreeable, and announces he will attend the assembly with a large party. Mr. Bingley returns Mr. Bennet's visit, but only sees Mr. Bennet, although the ladies catch a glimpse of him. Mrs. Bennet invites him to dinner, but he declines, stating he must go to London. This is later revealed to be to gather a party for the ball.

At the Meryton assembly, Mr. Bingley is amiable and dances frequently, showing particular admiration for Jane Bennet, the eldest daughter. However, his friend, Mr. Darcy, a much wealthier man, is proud and disagreeable, refusing to dance with most ladies and deeming Elizabeth Bennet, the second daughter, ""tolerable; but not handsome enough to tempt me."" Elizabeth overhears this slight. Mrs. Bennet is infuriated by Darcy's rudeness and his treatment of Elizabeth. Jane, however, expresses her strong admiration for Bingley and his sisters, while Elizabeth remains wary of the Bingley sisters' pride.

Elizabeth begins to notice Darcy's increasing interest in her, despite her initial disdain. At a gathering at Sir William Lucas's house, Elizabeth playfully confronts Darcy about his ""satirical eye."" Later, Sir William attempts to make Elizabeth dance with Darcy, but she refuses. Miss Bingley, observing Darcy's attention to Elizabeth, sarcastically teases Darcy about Elizabeth. Darcy retorts by praising Elizabeth's ""fine eyes,"" much to Miss Bingley's astonishment and jealousy.

The Bennet family's financial situation is revealed: the Longbourn estate is entailed to Mr. Collins, a distant cousin, meaning the daughters will lose their home upon Mr. Bennet's death. Mrs. Bennet's younger daughters, Kitty and Lydia, are obsessed with the local militia officers newly quartered in Meryton. Jane becomes ill while visiting Netherfield, a situation Mrs. Bennet orchestrates to prolong Jane's stay with Bingley. Elizabeth walks three miles through mud to nurse Jane, earning contempt from Miss Bingley and Mrs. Hurst, but kindness from Mr. Bingley. Darcy is conflicted, admiring Elizabeth's ""brightened"" eyes but questioning her ""conceited independence.""

During Elizabeth's extended stay at Netherfield, Miss Bingley and Mrs. Hurst openly criticize Elizabeth's family and low connections, while Darcy listens, adding that such connections would ""materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration."" Darcy, however, also defends Elizabeth's walk to Jane as a sign of affection. Elizabeth is disgusted by the Bingley sisters' snobbery. Darcy is caught looking at Elizabeth, though she is unaware of his developing feelings.

Mr. Collins arrives at Longbourn, a pompous clergyman under the patronage of Lady Catherine de Bourgh. He reveals his intention to marry one of the Bennet daughters as ""amends"" for inheriting their estate. He initially chooses Jane, but Mrs. Bennet subtly redirects him to Elizabeth. At Mrs. Philips's house (Mrs. Bennet's sister), the Bennet girls meet Mr. Wickham, a charming officer. Darcy and Bingley ride by, and Darcy and Wickham exchange a significant, cold glance. Elizabeth is intrigued.

Wickham tells Elizabeth his version of his past with Darcy: he claims Darcy, out of jealousy, defrauded him of a valuable church living bequeathed by Darcy's father (Wickham's godfather), leaving him in poverty. Elizabeth is horrified and believes Wickham. She feels a strong attraction to him. Wickham also reveals that Darcy's aunt, Lady Catherine, is also Bingley's aunt, and that Darcy is destined to marry his cousin, Miss de Bourgh, who is a wealthy heiress. Elizabeth is disappointed for Miss Bingley, but not for Jane.

At the Netherfield ball, Elizabeth eagerly anticipates dancing with Wickham, but he is absent, which Mr. Denny attributes to Wickham avoiding Darcy. Elizabeth is upset and cold towards Darcy, who then unexpectedly asks her to dance. During their awkward dance, Elizabeth confronts Darcy about his treatment of Wickham and his role in separating Bingley and Jane. Darcy, in turn, alludes to Wickham's lack of retaining friends, and Sir William Lucas hints at Jane and Bingley's marriage. Mrs. Bennet loudly discusses Jane and Bingley, to Elizabeth's mortification, observing Darcy overhearing everything with a ""composed and steady gravity."" Mary Bennet's poor singing performance further embarrasses Elizabeth. Mr. Collins persistently monopolizes Elizabeth's time, preventing her from dancing with anyone else.

The Bingley family abruptly leaves Netherfield for London, with Miss Bingley writing to Jane to explain that Bingley has no intention of returning and that he is increasingly admiring Georgiana Darcy, hoping for their marriage. Jane is heartbroken, though Elizabeth tries to comfort her, believing Miss Bingley is manipulating her brother. Elizabeth is convinced Bingley's sisters and Darcy interfered to prevent the match, but Jane, with her charitable nature, refuses to believe ill of them.

Mr. Collins proposes to Elizabeth, detailing his reasons, including Lady Catherine's advice and his desire to make amends for the entail. Elizabeth flatly refuses, but Collins, believing it a customary female refusal, persists. Mrs. Bennet, enraged, tries to force Elizabeth to accept, but Mr. Bennet intervenes, giving Elizabeth a choice: ""Your mother will never see you again if you _do not_ marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you _do_."" Elizabeth smiles, relieved.

Charlotte Lucas, Elizabeth's friend, accepts Mr. Collins's proposal, seeking a comfortable establishment. Elizabeth is shocked and dismayed, believing Charlotte sacrificed ""every better feeling to worldly advantage."" Mrs. Bennet is furious at Elizabeth for refusing Collins and at Charlotte for accepting him, seeing her as a usurper of Longbourn.

Elizabeth visits Charlotte at Hunsford, Kent, where Mr. Collins is now rector. She meets Lady Catherine de Bourgh, who is arrogant, dictatorial, and full of unsolicited advice. Mr. Darcy and his cousin, Colonel Fitzwilliam, arrive to stay at Rosings. Elizabeth and Fitzwilliam converse pleasantly, and he reveals that Darcy recently saved a friend from an ""imprudent marriage"" due to ""very strong objections against the lady."" Elizabeth immediately realizes he means Bingley and Jane, confirming her worst suspicions about Darcy's interference.

Mr. Darcy then makes a surprising visit to Elizabeth and proposes marriage, confessing his ardent love but emphasizing her ""inferiority"" and the ""degradation"" of their connections. Elizabeth, incensed by his pride and his ruin of Jane's happiness, vehemently rejects him. She accuses him of inflicting Wickham's poverty and destroying Jane's prospects. Darcy, in turn, confesses he did everything to separate Bingley and Jane, as he believed Jane to be indifferent and found her family's lack of propriety objectionable. He also reveals the truth about Wickham: that Wickham squandered an inheritance from Darcy's father and later attempted to elope with Darcy's fifteen-year-old sister, Georgiana, for her £30,000 fortune.

Elizabeth is left in shock and self-reproach, realizing her own ""blind, partial, prejudiced, absurd"" judgment of both men. She is ashamed of her family's conduct and Darcy's knowledge of it.

Soon after, Lydia elopes with Wickham from Brighton, where the militia regiment had been quartered. Jane's letter brings this dreadful news. Elizabeth is distraught, blaming herself for not exposing Wickham's true character earlier. Mr. Gardiner, Elizabeth's uncle, immediately goes to London to assist Mr. Bennet in finding them. Mr. Darcy, unexpectedly appearing at Lambton where Elizabeth is staying, learns of the elopement and expresses sincere concern. Elizabeth feels a deepening interest and gratitude towards him.

Mr. Gardiner's letters reveal that Wickham had no intention of marrying Lydia and had accumulated significant gambling debts. Darcy, feeling responsible for not exposing Wickham, takes it upon himself to find them and negotiate a marriage. He pays Wickham's debts (over £1000) and buys him a commission in the Regulars in the north, in exchange for marrying Lydia and a settlement of £100 per year for her. Mr. Gardiner ensures the settlement of Lydia's share of the £5000. Mrs. Bennet is ecstatic about Lydia's marriage, completely oblivious to the disgrace and expense involved. Mr. Bennet is ashamed but accepts the arrangement. Elizabeth is humbled by Darcy's generosity, recognizing it was done for her sake.

Lydia and Wickham return to Longbourn after their wedding, displaying their characteristic thoughtlessness and impudence. Lydia boasts about her marriage and nearly reveals Darcy's role in her wedding, prompting Elizabeth to write to Mrs. Gardiner for the full story. Mrs. Gardiner confirms Darcy's extensive efforts and expense, noting his ""obstinacy"" in doing it all himself. She admits she now likes Darcy.

Mr. Bingley returns to Netherfield and renews his courtship of Jane. This time, his sisters are absent, and his affection for Jane is clear. After a few visits, Bingley proposes to Jane, and she joyfully accepts. Mrs. Bennet is overjoyed at Jane's engagement, forgetting all about Wickham and Lydia, focusing solely on the grandeur of the impending wedding. Mr. Bennet gives his consent, though teasing Jane about her yielding nature.

Lady Catherine de Bourgh, having heard a rumor of Darcy's intention to marry Elizabeth, unexpectedly visits Longbourn. She imperiously demands Elizabeth deny any engagement to Darcy and promises never to marry him, reminding her of Darcy's supposed engagement to Miss de Bourgh and Elizabeth's ""inferior connections."" Elizabeth, with newfound strength and conviction, calmly refuses to promise anything, asserting her right to choose her own happiness. Lady Catherine, incensed, leaves, cutting off all communication.

Darcy, emboldened by Elizabeth's refusal to Lady Catherine, returns to Longbourn and re-proposes, explaining that Lady Catherine's interference actually gave him hope, as he knew Elizabeth would not have denied an engagement if she were truly resolved against him. Elizabeth accepts, confessing her love and explaining her change of heart, dating it from seeing Pemberley. Darcy admits his pride and selfishness were corrected by her reproofs. He also reveals he confessed his past interference with Jane and Bingley to Bingley, and corrected Bingley's mistaken belief in Jane's indifference, thus facilitating Jane and Bingley's reconciliation.

Mr. Bennet, initially surprised and amused by Elizabeth's engagement to Darcy, is convinced by her assurances of love and the revelation of Darcy's actions for Lydia. Mrs. Bennet is ecstatic, focusing on Darcy's wealth and status.

Bingley and Jane remain at Netherfield for a year, then move to an estate near Derbyshire, closer to the Darcys. Kitty improves under the influence of her elder sisters. Mary remains at home, moralizing. Wickham and Lydia's characters do not change; they continue to be extravagant and irresponsible, often needing financial assistance from Jane and Elizabeth. Darcy, for Elizabeth's sake, helps Wickham further in his profession. Miss Bingley, though mortified, drops her resentment and becomes civil to Elizabeth to maintain access to Pemberley. Lady Catherine, after some resistance, reconciles with the Darcys and visits Pemberley. The Darcys maintain close ties with the Gardiners, grateful for their role in uniting them. Elizabeth finds true happiness with Darcy at Pemberley."
Robinson Crusoe-Daniel Defoe,"This detailed summary is based solely on the provided text, without any external information or prior knowledge of the book.

The story begins in 1632 in York, with the birth of Robinson Crusoe, the third son of a good family. His father, a foreigner from Bremen, had settled in Hull before moving to York. Crusoe's original name was Kreutznaer, but it was corrupted to Crusoe. He had two elder brothers; one was a lieutenant-colonel killed in Flanders, while the fate of the second brother is unknown.

From an early age, Crusoe harbored strong desires to go to sea, against the earnest wishes and commands of his ""ancient"" and ""wise"" father, who advocated for a moderate ""middle state"" of life, warning against the miseries of adventure. His father recounted how Crusoe's elder brother had also defied him and been killed in war. Crusoe's mother also tried to dissuade him. Despite being moved by his father's tears and prophecies of misery, Crusoe's resolve to stay home quickly faded. He attempted to persuade his mother to gain his father's consent for a single voyage, promising to settle if he disliked it, but she refused, saying his father would never agree. His father, upon hearing this, sighed, foreseeing Crusoe's future unhappiness.

Almost a year later, on September 1, 1651, Crusoe, then eighteen, impulsively boarded a ship bound for London from Hull, without his parents' blessing. This decision marked the beginning of his misfortunes. A violent storm arose immediately, making him terribly seasick and frightened. He repented, vowing to return home and obey his father if spared. However, once the storm abated, his companion (the ship's master's son) persuaded him to drink punch, and Crusoe's repentance was forgotten.

Six days later, while anchored in Yarmouth Roads, a more terrible storm struck. The ship sprang a leak, and despite desperate efforts to pump, it began to founder. They fired a gun for distress, and another ship sent a boat. Crusoe and ten other men narrowly escaped into the boat as their ship sank. The boat was driven towards shore, eventually landing near Winterton Ness. They walked to Yarmouth, where they received assistance from the community. Crusoe admitted he should have returned home but was driven by an ""ill fate"" and shame. The ship's master gravely warned him never to go to sea again, seeing his misfortunes as a sign from Heaven, but Crusoe ignored the advice and traveled to London by land, still intent on a life at sea.

In London, Crusoe embarked on a voyage to the coast of Africa (Guinea). He notes he sailed as a gentleman, not a sailor, missing the opportunity to learn practical skills. This first Guinea voyage, made with an honest captain who took a fancy to him, was successful. Crusoe invested £40 in trade goods and returned with gold-dust worth nearly £300, which unfortunately fueled his ambition. He also gained some knowledge of navigation.

Shortly after, his captain friend died. Crusoe, now a ""Guinea trader,"" embarked on a second voyage in the same vessel, commanded by the former mate. This was an ""unhappiest voyage."" Near the Canary Islands, their ship was attacked by a Turkish rover from Sallee. After a fierce battle in which three men were killed and eight wounded, Crusoe's ship was disabled, and they were captured and taken prisoner to Sallee, a Moorish port. Crusoe, being young and nimble, became the personal slave of the rover's captain, realizing his father's prophecy of misery had come true.

For two years, Crusoe, left ashore while his master went to sea, yearned for escape but saw no opportunity. An ""odd circumstance"" arose when his patron began taking his pinnace out fishing, often with Crusoe and a young Moor named Maresco. Crusoe proved adept at fishing. One time, a fog caused them to get lost at sea, leading his patron to equip the longboat with a compass and provisions for future trips.

The opportunity for escape presented itself when the patron planned a fishing trip with distinguished Moors, ordering extra provisions and three fowling-pieces to be loaded onto the boat. When the guests canceled, Crusoe was sent with the Moor (Ismael, called Muley) and the boy (Xury) to catch fish. Crusoe cunningly gathered additional supplies, including biscuits, water, cordial waters, beeswax, tools, powder, and shot, by making excuses and deceiving Muley. They sailed out. After fishing for some time, Crusoe, feigning lack of success, steered further out to sea. He then suddenly threw Muley overboard, threatening to shoot him if he returned to the boat, telling him to swim to shore. Muley complied. Crusoe then coerced Xury into loyalty with promises and threats, which Xury swore to.

Crusoe steered south along the ""Barbarian coast,"" avoiding detection. After five days, needing fresh water, he anchored at a river mouth. That night, they heard terrifying noises of wild beasts. A monstrous creature, possibly a lion, approached their boat; Crusoe shot it, driving it away. The next day, they ventured ashore. Xury, with Crusoe's gun, shot a hare-like creature for food. They found fresh water. Later, forced ashore again for water, they encountered a sleeping lion. Crusoe, using three loaded guns, shot and killed it. Xury, emboldened, also shot the dying creature. They skinned it for its hide.

Continuing south for ten to twelve days, they eventually saw black, naked people on the shore. Xury advised against landing, but Crusoe approached to communicate by signs. The natives exchanged dried meat and corn for nothing. While there, two large creatures (leopards) ran into the sea. Crusoe shot one dead, astonishing the natives, who helped him drag it ashore. They were grateful for the flesh and gave Crusoe the skin, along with more provisions and water.

Crusoe then sailed towards the Cape de Verde Islands. While pondering his next move, Xury spotted a Portuguese ship. Crusoe signaled distress, and the ship rescued them. The generous captain refused payment, promising to deliver Crusoe's goods to Brazil. He bought Crusoe's boat for eighty pieces of eight and Xury for sixty pieces, with the promise that Xury would be freed in ten years if he became Christian. Xury agreed.

They arrived in Brazil after a good voyage. Crusoe, with his rescued goods and the money from selling the boat and Xury, established himself as a planter, learning about sugar cultivation. He regretted selling Xury as he needed help. His old captain facilitated the transfer of £100 from Crusoe's London funds, invested in English goods and tools, which greatly aided his plantation. The captain even used his own present money to buy Crusoe an indentured servant. Crusoe prospered, acquiring another slave and European servant. However, his ambition led him to agree to a secret slave trading voyage to Guinea as a supercargo with other planters. He made a will, making the Portuguese captain his heir for half his estate if he ""miscarried.""

On September 1, 1659, exactly eight years after his first ill-fated voyage, Crusoe embarked. His ship, with six guns and fourteen men, carried trinkets for trade. After crossing the equator, a violent hurricane struck for twelve days, claiming one man and the boy. The ship, now leaky and disabled, was driven off course. A second storm then drove them westward. Land was sighted, but the ship struck a sandbank. Crusoe and ten others escaped in a boat, but a massive wave overturned it, drowning all but Crusoe.

Crusoe was washed ashore, ""half dead,"" the sole survivor. He despaired, having no food, shelter, or weapons. He spent the first night in a tree for safety. The next morning, he saw the shipwreck had floated closer to shore. He swam to it, climbing aboard using a rope. He found provisions (biscuit, rum) and, crucially, the carpenter's chest of tools. He painstakingly built a raft from ship timbers and made multiple trips over thirteen days, salvaging goods: more provisions (rice, cheese, dried meat, corn), cordial waters, rum, powder, shot, muskets, pistols, swords, a grindstone, nails, hatchets, clothes, sails, and ropes. On his last trip, he found money (gold and silver), which he initially scorned as useless but took anyway. A storm then completely destroyed the ship.

Crusoe then focused on establishing a secure dwelling. He chose a spot under a steep hill, constructing a semicircular fortification of strong stakes, cables, and turf, entered by a ladder. He dug into the rock behind his tent, creating a cave for storage and living. A lightning storm made him realize the danger of his gunpowder, so he divided 240 pounds into 100 small parcels and hid them. He hunted goats for food, developing a technique to shoot them from above. He killed a she-goat and its kid, which he tried to tame but had to kill for food.

Reflecting on his past, Crusoe experienced a profound spiritual awakening during a severe illness (ague and fever). He had a terrifying dream of a flaming figure condemning him. He realized his past life was wicked and godless and began to pray sincerely, acknowledging God's providence. Reading the Bible, he found comfort and a new understanding of ""deliverance"" as freedom from sin, not just the island. His health returned.

He established a routine of work, hunting, and Bible reading. He learned the island's seasons. He accidentally discovered barley and rice growing from chicken feed he had discarded, which he recognized as a blessing from Providence. He carefully harvested and saved the seeds, learning to sow twice a year for two crops. He could not make hooped casks but learned to make baskets from local wood. He discovered how to fire clay pots, making earthenware for cooking and storing liquids. He fashioned a wooden mortar and pestle for grinding corn and sieves from old neckcloths. He also learned to bake bread in earth-vessels used as ovens.

By his fourth year, Crusoe had a thriving plantation and abundant food, including a large stock of corn. He attempted to move the original longboat, but it was too heavy. He then built a large canoe, taking months, but realized he couldn't launch it to the water, abandoning it. These failures taught him to plan better. He found contentment in his isolated life, viewing the world as remote and his wealth as meaningless without use. His clothes and ink began to wear out; he fashioned goat-skin clothing and a clumsy umbrella.

Five years passed with little change. He successfully built a smaller canoe, digging a canal to launch it. This boat was too small for mainland ventures, so he resolved to circumnavigate the island. He fitted it with a mast, sail, and rudder. On November 6, his sixth year, he embarked, but was caught in a powerful current and carried far out to sea. Despairing, he was saved by an eddy and a breeze, returning to the island. He resolved never to venture far by sea again.

Returning to his ""country house"" (bower), he was startled to be greeted by his parrot, Poll, calling his name, a creature he had taught to speak. He improved his skills in pottery and basket-making. His powder supply dwindled, prompting him to find ways to acquire meat without shooting. He began trapping goats alive and, after several attempts, caught three young kids and an old he-goat (which he released, not knowing hunger would tame it). He successfully tamed the kids, realizing breeding them was the only long-term solution. He built a large enclosure for them, which eventually grew into a thick, natural hedge. He successfully made butter, cheese, and salt.

In his twenty-third year, while harvesting, Crusoe spotted a fire on his side of the island. He retreated to his heavily fortified ""castle"" and observed nine naked savages feasting on human flesh, with two canoes. He was horrified. They departed with the tide. He went to the site, found human remains, and resolved to attack the next group, but then reconsidered the morality of it, deciding to conceal himself and trust Providence. He moved his boat to a safer, more remote cove. His anxieties led him to discover a large, natural cave in the woods, where he moved his powder and spare arms for better security.

In his twenty-fourth year, he heard gunshots at sea, signaling a ship in distress. He lit a signal fire. The next morning, he discovered the wreck of a Spanish ship on rocks. He longed for companionship. Days later, he found the corpse of a drowned boy from the ship. Driven by a strong urge, he sailed his canoe to the wreck, rescuing a starving dog. He found two drowned men and salvaged two chests, a cask of rum, a powder-horn, and cooking utensils. The chests contained valuable cordial waters, sweetmeats, shirts, and a significant amount of money (gold and silver), which he considered useless but took. He stored these new items in his secret cave.

Two years later, still restless, Crusoe had a vivid dream of savages bringing a prisoner to be eaten, and the prisoner escaping to him. Soon after, he saw five canoes on shore with about thirty savages. He watched them feast on one prisoner. The second prisoner, a white man, escaped and ran towards Crusoe. Crusoe, feeling called by Providence, intercepted the three pursuers, knocking one down with his musket butt and shooting another who tried to attack him with a bow. The rescued savage knelt to Crusoe, placing Crusoe's foot on his head as a sign of eternal servitude. Crusoe named him Friday. Friday, given Crusoe's sword, then beheaded the stunned savage Crusoe had knocked down. Crusoe and Friday quickly buried the dead savages.

Crusoe brought Friday to his cave and gave him food. Friday, a well-built young man of twenty-six, showed immense gratitude and loyalty. Crusoe began teaching him English and Christian principles. Friday revealed his people (Caribbees) were cannibals who ate war prisoners, and that he had been among them when they feasted on twenty men, two women, and a child on the island. He also mentioned that seventeen ""white bearded men"" (Spaniards and Portuguese) lived among his nation on the mainland, having been saved from a shipwreck and living peacefully under a truce, as his people only ate wartime enemies.

Crusoe was initially wary of Friday but soon saw his sincere loyalty. Friday's earnest desire was for Crusoe to teach his people to be ""good, sober, tame mans"" and ""know God."" Crusoe was moved and promised never to send him away. They built a new, large canoe, learning from Crusoe's past mistakes, and launched it. Crusoe taught Friday to sail it.

In his twenty-seventh year, still hoping for deliverance, Crusoe and Friday planned to sail to the mainland to rescue the Spaniards. They prepared provisions. One morning, Friday rushed in, reporting three canoes (six, in reality) and savages on shore. Crusoe, seeing twenty-one savages and three prisoners, was filled with indignation. He armed himself and Friday heavily, and they approached the feasting site. Friday scouted and confirmed one of the prisoners was a white European.

Crusoe and Friday ambushed the savages, firing their guns. They killed three and wounded many in the first two volleys. The remaining savages fled, some to a canoe. Friday pursued and killed more. Crusoe freed the white prisoner, who identified himself as Spanish. The Spaniard, recovering, joined the fight, killing more savages. Friday also killed others. In total, 17 savages were killed.

They then discovered a second bound prisoner in one of the canoes – Friday's father. Friday was overcome with filial ecstasy. They tended to Friday's father and the wounded Spaniard. A storm arose, preventing pursuit of the remaining four savages in a canoe, who Crusoe believed perished. Crusoe brought Friday's father and the Spaniard to a new tent outside his main fortification, providing food and care. Crusoe now had three subjects: Friday (Protestant), his father (Pagan), and the Spaniard (Papist), allowing them liberty of conscience. Friday's father assured Crusoe the surviving savages would be too terrified to return, believing Crusoe and Friday were ""heavenly spirits.""

The fear of savages subsided. Crusoe discussed with the Spaniard the plan to rescue the sixteen other countrymen and Portuguese on the mainland, who were living in distress. The Spaniard warned against bringing them over immediately due to insufficient provisions, suggesting they wait for another harvest. They all worked to cultivate more land, sowing barley and rice, and increasing their goat flock. They cured vast quantities of grapes into raisins.

With a full supply of food, Crusoe sent the Spaniard and Friday's father in a canoe to the mainland, giving them muskets and strict instructions to bring back the other Spaniards only if they swore loyalty and submission to Crusoe. This was the first step towards his deliverance in twenty-seven years.

Eight days later, Friday rushed in, announcing ""they are come!"" Crusoe saw an English long-boat and ship, but felt a ""secret doubt"" and suspicion about their presence. He observed eleven men landing, three of whom were bound prisoners. Friday mistakenly believed they were cannibals. Crusoe realized they were mutineers. The mutineers carelessly left their boat aground, then strayed into the woods.

Crusoe approached the three prisoners, who turned out to be the captain, his mate, and a passenger, set ashore by the mutineers. Crusoe offered to help, setting conditions for their submission to his authority and passage to England. They agreed. Crusoe and Friday, with the captain and his two men, ambushed the mutineers, killing two of the ""incorrigible villains"" and forcing the rest to surrender and swear loyalty. They were bound.

Crusoe then recounted his twenty-seven-year story to the astonished captain. They planned to recover the ship. They disabled the mutineers' second boat. The ship fired signals for its missing crew, then launched a third boat with ten armed men. Crusoe and the captain identified the mutineers, noting three honest men among them. They secured their existing prisoners. The new group of mutineers landed, found their boat damaged, and shouted for their comrades. They then returned to the ship, but soon came back to shore, leaving three men in the boat while seven went inland to search.

Crusoe devised a stratagem to draw the inland mutineers away, while he and his group captured the boat and the two men left in it. The captured man, less involved in the mutiny, joined them. They then waited in the dark for the rest of the mutineers, who returned tired and dismayed to find their boat aground and their comrades gone. Believing the island enchanted, they panicked. Crusoe's group ambushed them, killing the boatswain (the ringleader) and wounding another. Crusoe, with his ""army"" of eight men, then called for the others to surrender. They did so, except for Will Atkins, who begged for mercy. The captain told them they were prisoners of the ""governor"" (Crusoe), who could hang them, but might send them to England for justice, except for Atkins, who would be hanged in the morning.

This deception worked. Atkins begged for his life, and the others pleaded not to be sent to England. Crusoe then, still in disguise as ""the governor,"" met with the captain and planned to seize the ship. They divided the prisoners, sending Atkins and two others to the cave as hostages. The remaining prisoners were offered a pardon if they helped recover the ship. They eagerly agreed.

The captain, his mate, passenger, and nine loyal men boarded the ship at midnight. They swiftly overwhelmed the remaining mutineers, killing the rebel captain and securing the vessel. The captain fired seven guns, the signal of success. Crusoe, woken by the signal, climbed the hill and met the captain, who embraced him as his ""dear friend and deliverer,"" declaring the ship and all aboard were his. Crusoe was overwhelmed with joy and thankfulness.

The captain brought Crusoe provisions and new clothes, which Crusoe found uncomfortable after so long. They then decided the fate of the mutineer prisoners. Crusoe, still playing the role of governor, offered the two most incorrigible ones the choice of being left on the island or taken to England for trial. They chose to stay. He then addressed the other prisoners, showing them the rebel captain hanging from the yard-arm. They all chose to stay on the island rather than face hanging in England. Crusoe provided them with firearms, ammunition, and instructions for living, including managing the goats and expecting the seventeen Spaniards.

The next morning, two of the men left on the island swam to the ship, complaining of the other three and begging to be taken aboard. The captain, after some reluctance, took them in, and they later became honest. Crusoe left the island on December 19, 1686, after 28 years, 2 months, and 19 days, taking his goat-skin cap, umbrella, and a parrot as mementos, along with his long-useless money.

He arrived in England on June 11, 1687, after 35 years' absence. He found his former benefactor, the widow, alive but poor, and he assisted her. His parents were dead, and his other family was mostly gone, except for two sisters and two nephews. He had no inheritance in England. The ship owners, grateful for his role in saving their ship, presented him with almost £200.

Feeling this was insufficient to settle, he traveled to Lisbon with Friday to inquire about his Brazilian plantation. He found his old Portuguese captain, who informed him that his partner was rich, and his plantation had greatly improved. However, due to Crusoe being presumed dead, his share of the profits had been appropriated for the king and a monastery. It would be restored if he claimed it. The captain, who had received some early profits, returned 160 moidores to Crusoe and offered his share in his son's ship as security for the rest. Crusoe, moved by the captain's honesty, took only 100 moidores, released the captain from his debt, and granted him and his son annual payments from the plantation.

Crusoe, now master of over £5000 and an estate worth over £1000 a year, had to decide his next steps. He sent money to his old widow friend and his sisters. He resolved to return to England by land, as he had a strong aversion to sea travel, especially after two ships he had considered taking had met with disaster. He traveled from Lisbon with an English gentleman, two English merchants, two Portuguese gentlemen, Friday, and an English sailor.

Their journey through Spain and France was difficult. They encountered severe snow in the Pyrenees. Friday was terrified by the cold and snow. They found a guide who led them over a less difficult path. They faced attacks from ravenous wolves and a bear. Friday bravely shot a wolf and then cleverly outwitted and shot a monstrous bear, entertaining the company. Later, they encountered a massive pack of wolves, finding devoured men and horses. They fought a desperate battle, firing volleys and using a powder train to repel the wolves.

After reaching Toulouse, Crusoe learned from locals how fortunate they were to survive the wolf attacks. He then traveled to Paris and landed safely at Dover on January 14.

Now wealthy, Crusoe settled in England, married, and had three children. His wife died. After nearly seven years, influenced by his nephew, a ship captain, Crusoe decided to embark on a voyage to the East Indies in 1694. During this voyage, he revisited his island colony, found the Spaniards thriving, and learned of their struggles with the mutineers he had left and battles with Caribbeans. He found about twenty young children on the island. He stayed twenty days, leaving supplies, arms, tools, and two workmen (a carpenter and a smith). He divided the land among them. From Brazil, he sent more people, including seven women, cows, sheep, and hogs to the island. He learned that 300 Caribbees had later invaded, but a storm destroyed their canoes, leading to the Caribbees' demise and the colonists' recovery of their plantations.

The provided text concludes by stating that a ""Second Part of my Story"" will describe Crusoe's further adventures and surprising incidents over ten more years."
Six Characters in Search of an Author-Luigi Pirandello,"The play opens on a stage set for a rehearsal, half-dark and empty, suggesting an impromptu performance. A theatre company is preparing to rehearse Act II of ""Mixing It Up,"" a play by Pirandello. The Manager enters, reviews his mail, and begins giving instructions to the Property Man for the set (a red room, serving as dining-room and study, with specific exits) and to the actors for their costumes. The Leading Man objects to wearing a cook's cap, finding it ridiculous. The Manager, frustrated with contemporary plays, explains the metaphorical meaning of the cook's cap, linking it to ""reason without instinct,"" though he admits he doesn't fully understand it and expects the play to be a ""glorious failure.""

At this point, a Door-keeper announces visitors. Six Characters enter: The Father, The Mother, The Step-Daughter, The Son, The Boy (14), and The Child (4). They are surrounded by a faint, almost ethereal light. The Father explains they have come in search of an author. The Manager, annoyed, states there is no author and he is merely rehearsing. The Step-Daughter vivaciously suggests they could be his new play.

The Manager dismisses them as mad. The Father, however, argues that their profession makes ""that which isn't true seem true"" and that characters, once conceived, are more alive and real than breathing people, existing eternally even if their author dies. He asserts that they carry a profound ""drama"" within them and wish to live it out through the actors, if only for a moment.

The Manager and actors laugh, thinking the Characters are trying to be funny. The Step-Daughter, displaying a provocative attitude, declares her ""passion"" for the Father and offers to dance and sing, performing a French song. She then dramatically recounts parts of their story, stating that the Child will die, the Boy will do ""stupidest things,"" and she will run away. She reveals that she and the two younger children are ""bastards"" and that The Son, the ""legitimate son,"" despises them and their common mother, whom he refuses to recognize as his own. The Mother grows faint and begs the Manager for help.

The Father reveals that the Mother is his wife, surprising the Manager since he is alive but she is described as a ""widow."" The Father explains her drama involves a deceased lover, from whom she had the three younger children. The Mother insists the Father forced her to go away with the other man. The Step-Daughter interjects, claiming the Mother says this to make the Son believe she didn't abandon him willingly, as he neglects her. The Mother denies this, swearing the Father forced her. The Step-Daughter confirms the Mother lived happily with her deceased lover and later shockingly reveals that the Father frequented places like ""Madame Pace's shop,"" which she implies is a brothel, and was about to offer her (the Step-Daughter) money in a pale blue envelope there. The Son expresses disgust, calling this ""vile."" The Step-Daughter, however, expresses a desire to ""live that scene"" again, vividly describing the setting of Madame Pace's shop.

The Father attempts to explain his actions, citing the impossibility of true understanding through words, as each person has their own interpretation. He speaks of his pity for the Mother and his exasperation when she and his devoted clerk communicated silently. He admits sending the clerk away and then the Mother. He defends sending his legitimate Son away to the country, claiming it was for the boy's health, not cruelty. The Step-Daughter mocks his claims of ""moral sanity"" given his visits to Madame Pace's. The Father argues this apparent contradiction proves he is a ""live man."" He confesses he couldn't live with the Mother due to pity, not boredom, and sent her away, well-provided for, to be ""free of him"" (and for his own liberation). He claims he watched her new family (with the Step-Daughter's other father) with ""pure interest,"" a claim the Step-Daughter confirms, describing him following her from school when she was a child. The Father finds this ""infamous."" He explains his house felt empty after the Mother left, and his curiosity and tender sentiment drew him to her new family.

The Step-Daughter then reveals that after her (step)father died, they faced extreme misery and returned to the city, unknown to the Father. The Mother, barely literate, failed to contact him. The Father explains his interest in them had dwindled. He then speaks of the ""misery"" of a man alone, driven by ""miserable flesh"" to ""unconfessable things,"" and the ""red shame of human bestiality."" The Step-Daughter dismisses his philosophy as revolting ""crocodiles' tears.""

The Manager urges them to get to the point. The Father reveals that the Mother, in her misery, took work as a modiste at Madame Pace's. The Step-Daughter clarifies the true nature of Madame Pace's shop, where she would indirectly pay for her mother's sewing by her own exploitation. One day, the Step-Daughter met the Father there, who was an ""old client."" The Mother arrived ""in time"" (or ""almost in time,"" according to the Step-Daughter) to witness the situation. The Father recognized her and took them all home. He laments the ""perfidy"" of the Step-Daughter for exposing him in such a shameful moment.

The Son scornfully declares he has ""nothing to do with it"" and refuses to participate, calling his step-siblings ""bastards"" and ""vulgar folk."" He describes his horror at seeing the Step-Daughter and her siblings arrive, making him feel like an ""intruder."" He considers himself an ""unrealized character"" and wants to be excluded. The Father insists the Son is ""the hinge of the whole action"" and points to the humiliated Boy as an image of his deceased father. The Manager, interested, decides there's material for a drama and agrees to try to ""sketch it out"" scene by scene, inviting the Characters to his office. The actors express disbelief and ridicule this ""madness.""

**Act II** begins with the Step-Daughter, the Child, and the Boy emerging from the Manager's office. The Step-Daughter is furious, exclaiming ""Nonsense! nonsense! Do it yourselves!"" She tries to run away with the Child, explaining that the stage is a place for ""make-believe."" She then discovers a revolver in the Boy's pocket, lamenting he didn't use it on the Father and Son instead of himself. The Father and Manager, excited, return and coax the Step-Daughter back to the office to finalize arrangements.

The Son, meanwhile, expresses his continued resentment, feeling forced to be there and ashamed to reveal his family's intimate drama on stage. The Manager supervises the stagehands as they set up the scene to represent Madame Pace's shop, with a white parlor, furniture, a gilt table, a mirror, and a screen. The Step-Daughter is particular about the details, insisting on a yellow, flowered sofa. The Manager assigns his Prompter to take down the scenes in shorthand.

The Manager informs his actors they will watch the Characters act first, as the Characters ""are the drama."" The Father is confused, believing he and the other Characters should ""be"" themselves. The Manager insists actors act, and characters are in a ""book."" He begins to cast his actors in the roles of the Characters, naming the Mother ""Amalia."" The Step-Daughter bursts out laughing at the idea of the Leading Lady playing her, saying the actress is not ""in the least like me."" The Father agrees that their ""temperaments"" and ""souls"" are different. The Manager dismisses this, asserting that actors give form and voice to the characters, and the merit will be theirs. The Father expresses distress at being acted, feeling the actors will portray a version of him that isn't his true self.

The Manager, trying to proceed with the scene at Madame Pace's, asks where Madame Pace is. The Father says she's alive but not with them. The Father then instructs the actresses to take off their hats and a mantle, hanging them on pegs on stage. He theorizes that these ""articles of trade"" will attract Madame Pace herself to the stage. Miraculously, Madame Pace enters through the back door, a comically dressed, rouged, and powdered older woman. The Step-Daughter immediately runs to her, confirming her arrival. The Manager and actors are astonished, some calling it a ""vulgar trick."" The Father argues that Madame Pace, being ""herself in person,"" is more real and true than any actress.

The scene between the Step-Daughter and Madame Pace begins quietly and naturally, making it inaudible to the actors. The Manager urges them to speak louder. The Step-Daughter explains these are private matters; her previous loud speaking was for revenge against the Father. She hints that the Father (waiting ""behind that door"") will hear them. Madame Pace speaks in a comical half-Italian, half-Spanish jargon, which the Manager finds provides ""comic relief."" Madame Pace mentions an ""old signore who wanta talka nicely with you.""

Suddenly, the Mother jumps up, screaming, ""You old devil! You murderess!"" and attempts to attack Madame Pace. The Step-Daughter and Father intervene. The Step-Daughter states the Mother cannot be on stage with Madame Pace. The Father explains their simultaneous presence would ""give the whole thing away,"" as Madame Pace was not part of their original family. Madame Pace, offended, refuses to act with the Mother present and exits furiously.

The Step-Daughter dictates the Father's entrance and her own modest demeanor for the encounter scene. The Manager then directs the Father and Step-Daughter through the scene where he approaches her, asks if she's been there before, takes her hat, and offers her a new one. The Step-Daughter, dressed in black mourning, declines with veiled disgust. The Mother watches the scene, sobbing uncontrollably. The Manager pauses the scene, planning to re-enact it with his actors.

When the Leading Man and Leading Lady attempt to play the scene, the Father and Step-Daughter find their performance completely artificial. The Step-Daughter bursts out laughing at the Leading Man's entrance and the Leading Lady's stiff portrayal, stating it's not how she would react in reality. The Father agrees that their manner and tone are wrong. The Manager, exasperated, insists they proceed.

The Step-Daughter then vehemently rejects the Manager's desire to soften the scene into a ""romantic sentimental"" drama, where the Father would ask why she's in mourning and she would respond with tears. She insists on the horrific truth: the Father actually said, ""Well, let's take off this little dress at once,"" and she, ""with her two months' mourning in her heart,"" went behind a screen, her ""fingers tingling with shame."" The Manager is horrified and declares this cannot be staged. The Step-Daughter threatens to leave, accusing him of trying to stage the Father's ""cerebral drama"" and ignore her ""part."" The Manager argues for the constraints of the stage, where no single character can overshadow others. The Step-Daughter asserts the Father is responsible for all her ""faults,"" even before her birth. The Mother, overwhelmed, breaks into tears.

The Step-Daughter challenges the Manager: if he wants to see the drama ""flash out as it really did,"" he must ask the Mother to leave. The Mother cries out in anguish, refusing, stating her ""torment isn't a pretended one."" She explains that the two younger children cling to her, keeping her torment ""actual and vivid"" but for themselves ""they do not exist."" The Father explains the Step-Daughter is fixing him ""eternally in the stocks"" for that ""one fleeting and shameful moment."" The Manager agrees to make this scene the nucleus of Act I. The Step-Daughter vividly describes how she will play her part: leaning her head on the Father's breast, arms around his neck, feeling a pulsing vein, then closing her eyes in disgust as she sinks onto him. She urges the Mother to ""Cry out as you did then!"" The Mother, with a cry, separates them, calling the Father a ""brute."" The Manager, thrilled with the dramatic climax, cries ""Fine! fine! Damned good! And then, of course--curtain!"" The Machinist mistakenly lets the curtain fall completely, but the Manager, standing in front of it with the Father, is pleased with the ""certain effect"" and guarantees the first act.

**Act III** begins with the stage reset to represent a garden with trees and a fountain basin. The Manager, confident, plans Act II, despite the Step-Daughter's insistence that their entry into the Father's house was ""in spite of"" the Son, and the Mother's plea that her attempts to resist were ""for conscience sake."" The Step-Daughter also objects that the entire action cannot happen in the garden, as the Son is always in his room and the Boy's scenes are indoors. The Manager insists on combining and grouping scenes due to theatrical constraints.

The Father becomes agitated when the word ""illusion"" is used, finding it ""painful, cruel."" He explains that what is a ""game of art"" for the actors is their ""sole reality."" He then challenges the Manager's own reality, arguing that human reality is transitory and fleeting, changing daily, whereas their reality as characters is ""immutable"" and ""fixed for ever."" The Manager, annoyed by the philosophizing, reminds the Father that he introduced himself as a character created by an author who abandoned them. The Father justifies his philosophizing as expressing his suffering and asserts that characters acquire independence from their authors. The Step-Daughter confirms she tried to tempt their author to write their story, suggesting he abandoned them out of ""disgust for the ordinary theatre."" The Son agrees. The Father, however, insists on portraying his ""torment of spirit"" rather than just the ""fact"" (as the Step-Daughter wants for her ""vendetta""). The Manager stresses that ""Drama is action, sir, action and not confounded philosophy.""

The Manager decides to stage all subsequent actions in the garden, with the Boy hiding behind trees. The Step-Daughter describes her only pleasure as seeing the Child happy and careless in the garden after their shared misery. The Manager attempts to direct the Boy, but the Step-Daughter states he won't speak as long as the Son is present. The Son tries to leave, delighted, but the Mother, alarmed, instinctively tries to stop him. The Son firmly refuses to act, claiming he stands for the author's will to not put them on stage. The Father tries to force him, leading to a struggle.

The Step-Daughter intervenes, directing the scene by having the Child go to the fountain. The Son objects to combining scenes, stating his interaction with the Mother happened in his room, not the garden. He expresses profound discomfort with the actors studying them, feeling they are creating a ""horrible grimace"" of their likeness. The Mother explains she entered his room to ""empty her heart"" of anguish, but the Son insists ""Nothing happened!"" and he simply left to avoid a scene.

The Father, in a rage, again tries to force the Son to act for his mother, questioning his ""guts to be a son."" The Son resists, accusing the Father of having ""no decency"" for insisting on showing everyone their shame, again asserting his will and the author's. The Son, exasperated, finally reveals what happened: he was walking in the garden, saw the baby ""there in the fountain,"" and as he ran to pull her out, he saw the Boy ""standing stock still, with eyes like a madman's, watching his little drowned sister, in the fountain!""

As the Step-Daughter bends over the fountain, sobbing, a revolver shot rings out from behind the trees where the Boy is hidden. The Mother screams, ""My son! My son! Help! Help!"" and runs towards the sound with several actors. Some actors exclaim, ""He's dead! dead!"" while others insist, ""No, no, it's only make believe, it's only pretence!"" The Father cries out, ""Pretence? Reality, sir, reality!"" The Manager, completely exasperated, exclaims, ""Pretence? Reality? To hell with it all! Never in my life has such a thing happened to me. I've lost a whole day over these people, a whole day!"" The curtain falls, ending the play."
The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn-Mark Twain,"Huckleberry Finn (Huck) introduces himself, mentioning that he and his friend Tom Sawyer became rich by finding robbers' gold in a cave. Each received six thousand dollars, invested by Judge Thatcher, yielding a dollar a day. The Widow Douglas attempts to ""sivilize"" Huck by making him live in her respectable house, which he finds restrictive. He briefly runs away but is persuaded by Tom to return by the promise of joining a band of robbers, provided he acts respectably.

At the widow's, Huck endures new clothes, formal meals, and lessons from Miss Watson (the widow's sister), who teaches him about religion. Huck dislikes her descriptions of the good place (heaven) and bad place (hell), wishing to go to hell if Tom Sawyer isn't going to heaven. Feeling lonely and superstitious at night, Huck is relieved when Tom Sawyer signals him.

Huck and Tom sneak out. They narrowly avoid detection by Jim, Miss Watson's enslaved man, whom Tom pranks by hanging his hat on a tree limb above him. Jim later spins elaborate tales of witches riding him across the state, making him a revered figure among other enslaved people. Tom, Huck, and other boys form ""Tom Sawyer's Gang,"" taking a blood oath to rob and murder. Huck nearly gets excluded for not having family to be killed if he breaks the oath, but offers Miss Watson. They argue about the nature of robbery and ransom, with Tom insisting on following rules from adventure books, even when they're illogical. The gang's ""adventures"" are mostly pretend, like ambushing a Sunday-school picnic disguised as ""Spanish merchants and A-rabs."" Huck realizes Tom's stories about genies and enchantment are lies.

Months later, in winter, Huck has adapted somewhat to school and the widow's ways. However, he discovers his abusive, alcoholic father, Pap, has returned to town, evidenced by his distinctive boot tracks with a nail-cross in the snow. Fearing Pap will take his money, Huck ""sells"" his six thousand dollars to Judge Thatcher for a dollar. That night, Huck consults Jim's magic hair-ball, which predicts Pap's uncertainty, Huck's future troubles and joys, and a warning to stay away from water due to a hanging prophecy.

Huck returns to his room to find Pap waiting. Pap, enraged by Huck's education and respectable appearance, physically abuses him and demands his money. Judge Thatcher and the widow try to gain guardianship of Huck, but a new judge refuses to separate father and son. Pap is jailed for a week after a drunken spree. The new judge attempts to reform Pap, but he quickly relapses, trading new clothes for whiskey and breaking his arm.

Pap abducts Huck, taking him to a secluded log cabin on the Illinois shore. He keeps Huck locked up, frequently getting drunk and beating him. Huck initially enjoys the wild, unsivilized life but eventually grows weary of the beatings and long periods of confinement. He finds an old wood-saw and begins to saw his way out of the cabin. When Pap returns, complaining about a new court case to give Huck to the widow, Huck decides to escape for good.

He stages his own murder: he saws his way out, gathers supplies in a hidden canoe, kills a wild pig and uses its blood to fake a violent death, smashes the cabin door, and drags a sack of rocks to the river to suggest his body was dumped. He also leaves a trail of cornmeal leading to a lake to mislead trackers. He then hides in his canoe.

That night, Huck sees Pap paddling by, sober. Huck flees downstream. He lands on Jackson's Island, a large, uninhabited island. The next morning, he witnesses the townsfolk (including Pap, Judge Thatcher, Tom Sawyer, and Aunt Polly) on a ferryboat, firing a cannon over the river to make his supposed corpse float. He finds a loaf of bread containing quicksilver, a method used to locate drowned bodies, and eats it.

Days later, Huck discovers a smoking campfire on the island. He finds Jim, who, thinking Huck is a ghost, is terrified. Huck reassures him. Jim reveals he ran away after overhearing Miss Watson planning to sell him to New Orleans for eight hundred dollars. He swam to the island after the town believed Huck was dead. Jim also tells Huck how some enslaved people on the island found Huck's damaged raft after the steamboat accident and were arguing over it, and he used Huck's name (and ten cents) to claim it for them.

They establish a comfortable hideout in a cavern on the island. A severe storm hits, confirming Jim's weather predictions. The river rises, flooding parts of the island. They salvage a lumber raft and, one night, board a derelict two-story frame-house floating downriver. Inside, they discover a dead man, shot in the back. Jim prevents Huck from seeing the face. They salvage various items, including clothing, tools, and money.

Jim is deeply superstitious, sharing beliefs about bad luck from snake-skins (which Huck had touched) and other signs. Jim recounts losing money on poor investments and proudly states his worth is eight hundred dollars because he ""owns mysef.""

As they float down the Mississippi, Jim expresses his desire to reach Cairo, Illinois, where he can take a steamboat up the Ohio River to free states. Huck is troubled by his conscience, feeling guilty about helping Jim, Miss Watson's property, escape. He resolves to turn Jim in. However, when Jim expresses profound gratitude and calls Huck his ""only fren’,"" Huck's resolve wavers.

They encounter two slave-hunters who suspect Jim is a runaway. Huck, after a struggle with his conscience, lies and claims his ""pap"" (on the raft) has smallpox. The men, fearing contagion, give him forty dollars and tell him to float twenty miles downstream to a different town. Huck is relieved, deciding to always do ""whichever come handiest at the time."" Jim is pleased, believing Huck saved him.

They realize they passed Cairo in a fog. Their canoe is stolen. A steamboat crashes into their raft, splitting it apart. Huck and Jim are separated. Huck swims to shore and stumbles upon a large log house, where dogs corner him.

He is taken in by the Grangerford family, who mistake him for ""George Jackson."" He invents a new backstory for himself. He learns about the long-standing, violent feud between the Grangerfords and the Shepherdsons. He becomes friends with Buck Grangerford, a boy his age. One Sunday, after a sermon on brotherly love, Miss Sophia Grangerford secretly asks Huck to retrieve her Testament from church. Inside, Huck finds a note with ""Half past two"" written on it.

Later, Huck's personal enslaved boy, Jack, leads him to a hidden spot in the swamp where Jim is hiding. Jim explains he was separated from Huck during the steamboat collision but was found and hidden by other enslaved people. Jim also reveals that the raft was not completely destroyed and had been recovered by the local enslaved community.

The next morning, Huck learns that Miss Sophia Grangerford has eloped with young Harney Shepherdson. This ignites a bloody gunfight between the two families. Buck and his cousin Joe are killed, shot from the riverbank as they try to escape by swimming. Huck, horrified, finds their bodies and covers their faces. He is filled with guilt, believing his failure to tell Miss Sophia's father about the note led to the tragedy. He flees to the swamp, where he finds Jim and the recovered raft. They immediately shove off onto the Mississippi, both relieved to be away from the feuds.

Days later, they pick up two con artists: a bald, seventy-year-old man and a younger man of thirty. The older man claims to be the ""late Dauphin,"" Louis XVII, the rightful King of France, while the younger claims to be the Duke of Bridgewater. Huck quickly realizes they are frauds but keeps quiet, learning from Pap that it's best to let such people have their way. Jim and Huck are forced to treat them with deference.

The Duke devises a plan to travel during the day: he creates a handbill for a runaway ""nigger"" (Jim), so they can pretend to have captured him if they encounter anyone. They also stage Shakespearean performances, with the Duke as Richard III and Romeo, and the King as the ""t'other chap"" and Juliet, and then Hamlet. Their first performance is a failure, so the Duke creates a new bill for ""THE ROYAL NONESUCH !!!"" with ""LADIES AND CHILDREN NOT ADMITTED,"" believing this will attract an audience.

The ""Royal Nonesuch"" is a crude, scandalous performance where the King prances around naked and painted. The first two nights, the audience is fooled into silence, encouraging more people to see the ""splendid show."" On the third night, the townsfolk bring rotten food and dead cats for revenge. The King and Duke, anticipating this, escape with the money. They earn $465.

Jim and Huck discuss kings, with Huck explaining that most kings are ""rapscallions"" based on his historical readings. Jim recounts his deep guilt over a past incident where he struck his deaf-and-dumb daughter, 'Lizabeth, not realizing her disability.

The frauds continue their cons, but their luck runs out. They are nearly broke again. The King goes ashore in Pikesville and is found drunk and ridiculed by loafers. Huck seizes the opportunity to escape with Jim, but returns to find Jim gone. A boy tells Huck that Jim, a runaway from New Orleans, has been captured at Silas Phelps's plantation for a $200 reward. The boy adds that the man who caught Jim sold his claim for $40.

Huck is distraught. He considers writing to Miss Watson to free Jim but grapples with his conscience. He writes the letter, but then reflects on his journey with Jim, recalling Jim's kindness and loyalty. He tears up the letter, declaring, ""All right, then, I’ll _go_ to hell""—deciding to ""take up wickedness again"" and steal Jim out of slavery.

Huck devises a plan to free Jim. He hides his raft and canoe, then goes to the Phelps's plantation. He is immediately mistaken by Aunt Sally Phelps for her nephew, Tom Sawyer. He plays along, inventing a new family history to match Tom's. He learns that the real Tom Sawyer is also expected.

Huck intercepts Tom Sawyer on the road. Tom, believing Huck is a ghost, is shocked but quickly grasps the situation. Huck confesses he's trying to free Jim. Tom, to Huck's astonishment, agrees to help, saying ""I’ll _help_ you steal him!"" Tom, posing as ""Sid Sawyer"" (his own brother), arrives at the Phelps's, creating more elaborate lies, even kissing Aunt Sally (who he pretends told him to do it).

At supper, they learn that the King and Duke's ""Royal Nonesuch"" performance was exposed, and the two con artists were tarred and feathered and ridden out of town on a rail. Huck feels sick and sorry for them, realizing the cruelty of human beings.

Tom deduces that Jim is being held in a hut by the ash-hopper, based on a ""nigger man"" taking food (including watermelon) there and the hut being locked. Tom dismisses Huck's simple escape plan as ""too blame’ simple"" and insists on a more adventurous, complicated scheme. He plans to ""dig him out"" with case-knives, claiming it will take weeks, but secretly intending to use picks. He insists on following rules from adventure books, even if they're impractical or dangerous.

They begin their elaborate plan, involving digging a tunnel with case-knives (later picks), making a rope ladder from sheets (to be baked in a pie), creating pens from a pewter spoon and brass candlestick (for Jim to write a journal in his own blood on a shirt), carving mournful inscriptions and a coat of arms on a grindstone, and filling Jim's cabin with rats, snakes, and spiders as ""pets."" They also create ""nonnamous letters"" (anonymous warnings) for the Phelpses, pretending to be from a reformed member of a gang planning to steal Jim. These letters cause great fear and excitement in the household.

On the night of the planned escape, Huck and Tom go fishing and return to find the Phelps family in a panic, due to the latest anonymous letter. Huck, dressed in Aunt Sally's dress, is sent to the cellar for butter, where Aunt Sally catches him. She suspects he's been ""up to something"" and orders him to the sitting-room, where fifteen armed farmers are waiting to ambush the supposed ""gang of cutthroats."" The melting butter running down Huck's face leads Aunt Sally to believe he has ""brain-fever,"" allowing him to escape to his room.

Huck tells Tom the house is full of armed men. Tom, thrilled, says everything is ready. They prepare to give the ""sheep-signal."" The farmers enter the cabin, and Huck, Jim, and Tom sneak out through the hole. They are almost caught at the fence, as Tom's pants snag. Shots are fired, and the farmers and dogs pursue them. Their own dogs, recognizing them, pass them by to follow the larger commotion. Huck, Jim, and Tom escape to the raft.

Tom reveals he's been shot in the calf. Jim and Huck are concerned, but Tom insists they continue the ""evasion"" with the raft. Jim, however, refuses to move without a doctor, stating his loyalty to Tom and demanding proper medical care. Huck agrees to get a doctor.

Tom instructs Huck on how to get the doctor without revealing Jim's location: blindfold him, make him swear silence, give him gold, lead him on a circuitous route, and take his chalk to prevent him from marking the raft. Huck leaves to find the doctor.

Huck finds a kind old doctor and invents a story about his brother (Tom) accidentally shooting himself on ""Spanish Island"" while hunting. The doctor, finding other boats locked, takes Huck's canoe to the raft. Huck hides.

He wakes late, learns the doctor hasn't returned. He nearly runs into Uncle Silas, who questions him about ""Tom"" (Huck's) whereabouts. Huck lies again, claiming he and ""Sid"" (Tom) were hunting the runaway ""nigger"" but lost them, then slept in a canoe, and ""Sid"" is now at the post-office.

At dinner, the farmers discuss the ""nigger"" (Jim's) elaborate escape preparations, believing him crazy or helped by many people or even ""sperits"" (spirits). Aunt Sally recounts the various stolen items and how they were fooled, locking Huck and Tom in their room for safety. Huck later explains to Aunt Sally that he and ""Sid"" went down the lightning-rod to see the fun.

Aunt Sally worries about ""Sid"" (Tom) not returning. Uncle Silas goes to look for him. Aunt Sally sits up all night, waiting by the window with a candle.

The next morning, Uncle Silas still hasn't found Tom. Aunt Sally receives a letter from her sister, Aunt Polly. Before she can read it, they see Tom Sawyer on a mattress, being carried home by the doctor and other men, with Jim (in Aunt Sally's calico dress) tied up.

Aunt Sally, relieved Tom is alive, prepares a bed. The men discuss hanging Jim, but decide against it because he isn't their property. They chain Jim in the cabin again, restricting him to bread and water. The doctor intervenes, stating Jim helped him nurse Tom, risking his freedom, and calling him a ""better nuss or faithfuler"" than any ""nigger"" he'd seen. The men soften and promise not to cuss Jim anymore.

Later, Tom, now awake and lucid, reveals the truth: ""Old Miss Watson died two months ago, and she was ashamed she ever was going to sell him down the river, and _said_ so; and she set him free in her will."" Tom explains he orchestrated the elaborate escape plan purely for the ""adventure of it.""

Just then, Aunt Polly arrives, revealing her identity and confirming Tom's story. She explains she wrote to Aunt Sally about Tom and ""Sid"" arriving, but the letters were intercepted by Tom to maintain his prank.

In the final chapter, Huck learns Tom's original plan was to free Jim in an elaborate adventure, then take him back home as a hero, paying him for his lost time. They free Jim, who is rewarded forty dollars by Tom for his patience as a prisoner. Jim is overjoyed, believing his ""hairy breas’"" prophecy of wealth has come true. Tom suggests they all go for more adventures amongst the ""Injuns"" in the territory. Huck expresses concern about having no money, assuming Pap has taken his.

Jim then reveals the ultimate secret: the dead man in the floating house was Pap. Jim had kept this from Huck to spare him.

With Tom mostly recovered, Huck decides he must ""light out for the territory ahead of the rest, because Aunt Sally she’s going to adopt me and sivilize me, and I can’t stand it. I been there before."""
The Count of Monte Cristo-Alexandre Dumas,"The provided text, ""The Count of Monte Cristo,"" details a complex narrative of betrayal, imprisonment, vengeance, and eventual redemption, primarily focusing on the life of Edmond Dantès and the interconnected lives of those who wronged him and those he sought to protect.

**Volume One: From Innocence to Betrayal**

The story begins on **February 24, 1815**, with the arrival of the ship _Pharaon_ in Marseilles. Its young mate, **Edmond Dantès**, an eighteen to twenty-year-old, resolute seaman, reports to the owner, **M. Morrel**, that their brave Captain Leclere died during the voyage. Dantès proudly states the cargo is safe and that he skillfully brought the ship to port. Morrel, impressed, hints at making Dantès the new captain.

However, the ship's supercargo, **Danglars**, a man of unprepossessing countenance and resentful of Dantès' popularity, subtly tries to undermine him. He falsely accuses Dantès of wasting time at the Island of Elba for whim. Dantès clarifies that he stopped at Elba to deliver a packet from the dying Captain Leclere to Marshal Bertrand, where he briefly encountered Emperor Napoleon. Morrel accepts this explanation but cautions Dantès about the political implications. Danglars then falsely insinuates that Dantès might have kept a letter entrusted to him by the captain.

Dantès, overjoyed by the prospect of captaincy and eager to see his loved ones, excuses himself from dinner with Morrel. He first visits his elderly **father**, Old Dantès, only to discover his father has been living in near-starvation, having used the money Edmond left him to pay a debt to **Caderousse**, a greedy neighbor and tailor. Dantès, heartbroken, gives his father all his money.

Caderousse arrives, feigning congratulations but showing avarice towards Dantès' newfound wealth. He hints that Dantès' betrothed, **Mercédès**, a beautiful Catalan, has many admirers. Dantès then leaves to see Mercédès.

In the Catalan village, Mercédès is confronted by her cousin, **Fernand Mondego**, who professes his love. Mercédès firmly rejects him, declaring her unwavering love for Edmond and vowing to die if he forgets her or if any harm befalls him. Dantès arrives, and they embrace. Fernand, consumed by jealousy, is present but Mercédès' warning prevents him from acting violently.

Fernand then joins Danglars and Caderousse at a nearby inn, La Réserve. Danglars, seeing Fernand's despair, manipulates him into a conspiracy against Dantès. Danglars writes an anonymous denunciation letter with his left hand (to conceal his identity) to the king's attorney, accusing Dantès of being a Bonapartist agent carrying secret communications from Elba. He then throws the letter away, pretending it was a joke. Fernand, however, picks up the letter, observed by Danglars.

The next day, during Dantès and Mercédès' wedding feast at La Réserve, a magistrate and soldiers arrive and arrest Edmond Dantès on charges of being a Bonapartist agent. Dantès, though surprised, remains calm, believing it to be a mistake. Old Dantès pleads for his son. Caderousse drunkenly hints at Danglars' involvement. M. Morrel leaves to seek information. Fernand, pale and agitated, disappears. Morrel returns, confirming the serious political accusation. Danglars silences Caderousse's attempts to reveal the truth by threatening him with complicity. Fernand takes Mercédès home, while Dantès' father is left in despair.

Danglars, seizing the opportunity, feigns concern and offers to take command of the _Pharaon_, which Morrel accepts. Dantès is imprisoned in Marseilles, but still hopes for release. He is then secretly transferred to the infamous Château d'If.

**Volume One: The Château d'If and the Abbé Faria**

Dantès is thrown into a gloomy dungeon at the Château d'If. He attempts suicide by starvation but hears a scratching sound from an adjacent cell. He communicates with the other prisoner, who is the **Abbé Faria**, an old, learned Italian priest believed to be mad. Faria reveals he was imprisoned for his political dream of uniting Italy. He has spent years digging an escape tunnel but made a calculation error, ending up in Dantès' cell instead of the sea.

Faria, a polymath, has secretly made tools, paper, pens, and ink from prison materials. He shares his vast knowledge with Dantès, teaching him languages, science, and history. In return, Dantès assists Faria in digging a new tunnel. Dantès, now educated and refined, develops a profound bond with the Abbé.

Faria reveals a crucial secret: he possesses a fragmented will of Cardinal Spada, detailing an immense hidden treasure on the uninhabited island of Monte Cristo. Faria has deciphered the will and claims half the treasure for Dantès.

The two prisoners labor for fifteen months, digging a new tunnel towards a guard gallery. However, Faria suffers a debilitating cataleptic attack, paralyzing half his body. He instructs Dantès to administer a special elixir to revive him. Dantès saves Faria, who then resigns himself to his fate but encourages Dantès to escape and claim the treasure. Dantès, out of loyalty, vows never to leave him.

Faria suffers a second, and then a third, fatal attack. He dies, urging Dantès to remember Monte Cristo. Dantès, distraught but resolute, conceives a desperate plan: he swaps places with Faria's corpse in the burial sack, hoping to be thrown into the sea and escape. He cuts himself free from the sack and the cannonball tied to his feet and swims to the Island of Tiboulen.

**Volume Two: Emergence and Early Vengeance**

After fourteen years in prison, Dantès is rescued by a Genoese smuggling ship, _La Jeune Amélie_. He assumes the identity of a shipwrecked sailor. He learns the date is **February 28, 1829**, and that **Old Dantès died of starvation** while Mercédès married Fernand. He vows implacable vengeance on Danglars, Fernand, and Villefort.

Dantès sells some diamonds and rewards **Jacopo**, a kind sailor, with a new boat and money, tasking him with inquiring about his father and Mercédès. Dantès then purchases a magnificent yacht and sails to Monte Cristo, where he unearths the Spada treasure. Now immensely wealthy, he transforms into the mysterious **Count of Monte Cristo**.

He begins to subtly manipulate the lives of his enemies. Disguised as an English clerk, he visits **M. de Boville**, the prison inspector, and buys his debt from Morrel. He learns the details of his own false imprisonment and the fate of Faria. He recovers **Danglars' original denunciation letter** from the prison files.

Still disguised as the English clerk, he visits **M. Morrel**, who is facing bankruptcy. The Count gives Morrel a three-month reprieve on his debts and secretly instructs Morrel's daughter, **Julie**, to follow instructions from ""Sinbad the Sailor."" On the appointed day, when Morrel is contemplating suicide, Julie receives money and a diamond (from the Count) that saves her father's firm and reputation. A new _Pharaon_, identical to the lost one and fully laden, arrives in port, a miracle orchestrated by the Count.

The Count, now in Paris, hosts a dinner at his newly acquired country house in Auteuil. He learns from **Bertuccio**, his Corsican steward, that this house was the scene of Bertuccio's vendetta against **Villefort** (who had refused to investigate his brother's murder). Bertuccio recounts how he stabbed Villefort and found a newborn infant buried alive by Villefort, which he then saved and gave to his sister-in-law, Assunta. This child, **Benedetto**, grew up to be a criminal and eventually caused Assunta's death.

At the dinner, the Count subtly reveals the discovery of a **newborn infant's skeleton** in the garden, causing intense distress to Villefort and **Madame Danglars**, the child's mother.

**Volume Three: Vengeance Unleashed**

Danglars, now facing financial ruin from stock market manipulations (some orchestrated by the Count, using false telegraph messages), is humiliated when the Count exposes his shady dealings and his wife's own speculations. The Count demands a substantial sum from Danglars, leaving him with only 50,000 francs.

**Albert de Morcerf**, now in Paris, is enraged by an anonymous newspaper article (instigated by the Count) exposing his father, **Fernand Mondego**, as a traitor who sold Ali Pasha and his family. Beauchamp, the journalist, confirms the truth with documented evidence from Yanina. Albert, though heartbroken by his father's dishonor, vows revenge on the unknown slanderer. He first confronts Danglars, who, in turn, reveals that Monte Cristo advised him to investigate Fernand. Albert then realizes Monte Cristo is the true orchestrator.

Albert challenges Monte Cristo to a duel. **Mercédès**, having recognized Dantès earlier, visits the Count and pleads for her son's life, confessing her own culpability in marrying Fernand. The Count is deeply moved and promises to spare Albert, but states he will offer his own life in return. He then writes a codicil to his will, leaving his fortune to **Maximilian Morrel** and **Haydée** (Ali Pasha's daughter), whom he now loves as his own daughter. Haydée, deeply in love with the Count, tears up the will, and confesses she would die if he left her. The Count, moved, agrees to live for her.

At the duel, Albert, having been informed by Mercédès of Dantès' true identity and the full extent of Fernand's treachery, **publicly apologizes to Monte Cristo** and retracts his challenge, refusing to fight a man who has such just cause for vengeance. Fernand, disgraced and abandoned by his wife and son, commits suicide.

Meanwhile, **Valentine de Villefort** is being slowly poisoned. **M. Noirtier**, her paralyzed grandfather, reveals to **Dr. d'Avrigny** that **Madame de Villefort** is the poisoner, seeking Valentine's inheritance for her own son, Edward. Noirtier reveals he had been secretly administering small doses of brucine to Valentine, immunizing her. The Count, having rented the adjoining house, watches over Valentine and intervenes, replacing the poison with an antidote, making her appear dead.

Valentine's apparent death causes deep grief. Maximilian, heartbroken, rushes to the Count, contemplating suicide. The Count reveals his true identity to Maximilian, who recognizes him as his father's savior, Edmond Dantès. The Count comforts him and promises to cure his despair.

**Volume Five: Full Retribution and Redemption**

**Andrea Cavalcanti** (Benedetto) is revealed as a fraud and an escaped galley-slave at his wedding contract signing with Eugénie Danglars. He is arrested for the murder of Caderousse, whose dying declaration (forced by the Count) exposed him. **Eugénie Danglars**, seizing the opportunity, escapes with her friend Louise d'Armilly, disguised as men, to pursue an artistic life in Brussels.

**Madame Danglars**, after her husband's flight, receives her portion of their illicit gains from Debray, who ends their affair. She is left wealthy but isolated.

**Villefort**, facing public humiliation from Benedetto's trial and his own public confession of infanticide, confronts his wife. He accuses her of the serial poisonings and, to protect his family's honor, orders her to poison herself or face public denouncement. Madame de Villefort, in a fit of madness, poisons herself and their son, **Edward**. Villefort, utterly broken and driven to insanity by the horrors, is found in the garden furiously digging for the long-buried infant. The Count reveals his true identity as Edmond Dantès to Villefort, who, recognizing him, falls into complete madness.

**Albert de Morcerf** and **Mercédès** have renounced Fernand's dishonored name and fortune. Albert joins the Spahis in Africa to make a new name. Mercédès, living humbly in Marseilles, accepts the 150 louis Dantès had buried for her decades ago, but vows to live in a convent and give the rest of her fortune to charity.

On **October 5th**, Maximilian Morrel, still consumed by grief, meets the Count on the Island of Monte Cristo, prepared to commit suicide. The Count offers him a final chance for happiness. He gives Maximilian a potent narcotic. Maximilian, believing it to be a fatal poison, swallows it. As he falls into a deep sleep, the Count reveals a living **Valentine de Villefort**, brought to him after feigning death.

**Haydée**, witnessing this, confesses her profound love for the Count, saying she would die without him. The Count, moved by her devotion and the culmination of his vengeance, embraces her, realizing he can find happiness too.

The next morning, Maximilian and Valentine awaken, reunited and astonished. Jacopo delivers a final letter from **Edmond Dantès**, the Count of Monte Cristo. In the letter, Dantès bequeaths his remaining fortune (including 20 million francs from the Monte Cristo treasure) to Maximilian, asking him to share it with Julie and Emmanuel. He instructs Valentine to give her inheritance to the poor. Dantès, now acknowledging God's supreme power, advises them to ""Wait and hope.""

Edmond Dantès then sails away on his yacht with Haydée, into the horizon, leaving behind a world where he has brought both retribution and boundless happiness."
The Decameron-Giovanni Boccaccio,"The Decameron begins with an author's personal reflection. He recounts suffering intensely from a profound love in his youth, finding solace in a friend's conversation. This passion eventually subsided, leaving him with a pleasant remembrance. Out of gratitude for the comfort he received, and recognizing that women, especially lovesick ladies, are more vulnerable and confined than men, he decides to provide them with a similar source of relief. His solution is to write one hundred stories, to be told over ten days by a company of seven ladies and three young men, interspersed with songs, which will offer both entertainment and guidance on love and the vicissitudes of fortune.

**The Framing Story**

The narrative then opens in Florence in the year 1348, amidst the horrific ""death-dealing pestilence"" (the Black Death). The plague manifested with painful swellings and dark blotches, causing death within three days, often without fever. It was highly contagious, spreading through contact with the sick, their clothes, and even to animals. The city descended into chaos: laws were ignored due to the death or sickness of officials, and societal bonds dissolved. People reacted in various ways: some isolated themselves in moderation, others indulged in wild revelry, and many fled to the countryside, abandoning family and possessions. The sick were left untended, dying in the streets or at home, their bodies often discovered only by their stench. Funerals became perfunctory, with bodies hastily buried in mass graves. The surrounding countryside suffered similarly, with abandoned farms and roaming livestock. By July, over 100,000 people had died in Florence.

One Tuesday morning, in the venerable church of Santa Maria Novella, seven young ladies, aged between eighteen and twenty-eight, all discreet, noble, and beautiful, gather in mourning attire. They are Pampinea, Fiammetta, Filomena, Emilia, Lauretta, Neifile, and Elisa. Pampinea proposes they leave the plague-ridden city for a country estate to escape the misery and live more pleasurably and honorably. Filomena agrees with the idea but wisely suggests that a company of women alone would be ""fickle, wilful, suspicious, faint-hearted and timorous"" and needs male guidance to maintain order and respectability. Elisa concurs, noting their male relatives have all fled.

Just then, three young men—Pamfilo, Filostrato, and Dioneo, all agreeable and well-bred, aged twenty-five or more—enter the church. They are seeking their mistresses (three of whom are among the seven ladies) or kinswomen. Pampinea, seeing this stroke of fortune, suggests they invite the men to join them as guides and servitors. Neifile expresses concern about scandal given the men's known affections for some of the ladies, but Filomena dismisses it, prioritizing honesty. All agree to the invitation. Pampinea, a kinswoman to one of the men, formally invites them to join the ladies in a ""pure and brotherly spirit,"" which the men joyfully accept.

The next morning (Wednesday), after preparations, the ten young people (with their servants) depart Florence. They arrive at a magnificent, well-appointed palace on a small hill, surrounded by beautiful gardens. Dioneo, the merriest, suggests they focus on making merry, having left their cares behind. Pampinea, as the group's initiator, proposes they elect a ""principal"" (a king or queen) each day to govern their activities, ensuring order and preventing jealousy. She is chosen as the first queen and crowned with a laurel wreath.

Pampinea assigns household duties to the servants (seneschal, purveyor, chambermaids, cooks) and instructs them to bring only ""joyous"" news from outside. She dismisses the company to enjoy the gardens until dinner at tierce (9 a.m.). They wander, chat, weave garlands, and sing. After a delightful and orderly dinner, they enjoy music, singing, and dancing before resting during the midday heat.

After none (3 p.m.), they reconvene in a cool meadow. Pampinea proposes storytelling to pass the time pleasantly, with each person telling a story of their own choosing. All agree. Pampinea asks Pamfilo to begin.

**Day the First: Stories of Wit, Cunning, and Transformation**

1.  **Master Ciappelletto (Pamfilo):** Ciappelletto, a notoriously wicked and unrepentant man, is hired to collect debts in Burgundy. He falls mortally ill while lodging with two Florentine brothers who fear scandal if he dies unshriven. To save them, Ciappelletto gives a meticulously false confession to a holy friar, portraying himself as a devout saint. The friar, completely deceived, preaches his sanctity, and Ciappelletto is buried with honor and becomes venerated as Saint Ciappelletto, with miracles attributed to him. Pamfilo uses this to illustrate God's mercy, which regards the purity of the suppliant's intent more than the worthiness of the intercessor.
2.  **Abraham the Jew (Neifile):** Jehannot de Chevigné, a Christian merchant, tries to convert his Jewish friend, Abraham. Abraham agrees to consider it but insists on visiting Rome first to observe the Christian clergy. Jehannot is distressed, fearing Abraham will be disgusted by the Roman court's depravity. Indeed, Abraham finds the clergy from the Pope down to be shockingly lustful, gluttonous, and avaricious, selling holy things and renaming simony. However, he returns to Paris convinced: if Christianity can thrive and grow despite such corrupt leaders, it must be divinely supported. He converts and is baptized Giovanni.
3.  **Melchizedek the Jew (Filomena):** Saladin, the Soldan of Babylon, needing money, seeks to extort it from the rich but miserly Jewish usurer Melchizedek. Saladin asks Melchizedek which of the three faiths (Jewish, Saracen, Christian) is the true one, hoping to trap him. Melchizedek, recognizing the snare, cleverly responds with the ""Story of Three Rings"": a father with three beloved sons gives each an identical ring, claiming it is the true heirloom that designates the heir, leaving the true heir forever in doubt. He applies this to the three religions, stating that the truth is likewise pending. Saladin, impressed by his wisdom, reveals his need. Melchizedek freely lends him the money, and they become friends.
4.  **The Monk and the Abbot (Dioneo):** A young monk in Lunigiana seduces a peasant girl in his cell. The Abbot overhears and, after the monk locks the girl in, grants the monk leave to fetch firewood, intending to catch him. The monk, however, had seen the Abbot watching. The Abbot enters the cell, is captivated by the girl's beauty, and seduces her himself. The monk, hidden, witnesses this. When the Abbot later attempts to punish him, the monk skillfully points out the Abbot's own recent ""mortification"" (his act with the girl), implying he saw him. Ashamed, the Abbot pardons the monk, and they secretly release the girl, who is believed to have returned to the monastery.
5.  **The Marchioness of Monferrato (Fiammetta):** King Philippe le Borgne of France, enamored by reports of the absent Marquis of Monferrato's beautiful wife, arranges to visit her during his journey to the Crusade, hoping to seduce her. The Marchioness, discerning his intent, welcomes him honorably but serves him a dinner consisting entirely of various hen dishes. The King, puzzled, asks if ""hens only born in these parts, without ever a cock?"" The Marchioness wittily replies that women are ""all of the same fashion here as elsewhere,"" implying that women, like hens, need a man and she is not available to the King. The King understands her chaste rebuke, abandons his design, and departs.
6.  **The Inquisitor and the Broth (Emilia):** A hypocritical Minor Friar and inquisitor, more interested in wealth than faith, persecutes a rich, simple man for a joking comment about his wine. The man pays a bribe to escape severe punishment. As part of his penance, he attends mass daily. One day, he overhears a Gospel verse promising a hundredfold return for good deeds. He tells the inquisitor that he pities the friars because, for all the surplus broth they give to the poor, they will be drowned in it in the afterlife, given the hundredfold return. The inquisitor, enraged by the exposure of his gluttony, dismisses the man.
7.  **Bergamino and Messer Cane della Scala (Filostrato):** Messer Cane della Scala, a magnificent Veronese nobleman, unexpectedly becomes miserly and dismisses all his entertainers except Bergamino, a witty minstrel, whom he then neglects. Bergamino, growing poor, indirectly rebukes Messer Cane by telling the story of Primasso. Primasso, a poor scholar, visits the famously generous Abbot of Cluny. The Abbot, upon seeing Primasso (shabbily dressed), has an uncharacteristic moment of avarice and delays dinner. Primasso, hungry, eats his three loaves of bread. The Abbot, realizing his folly, then welcomes Primasso, clothes him, gives him money, and a palfrey. Messer Cane, understanding the allegory, laughs, acknowledges his own avarice, clothes Bergamino, gives him money and a horse.
8.  **Guglielmo Borsiere and Messer Ermino de' Grimaldi (Lauretta):** Messer Ermino de' Grimaldi, an immensely wealthy Genoese gentleman, is infamous for his extreme avarice. Guglielmo Borsiere, a worthy minstrel, visits him. Ermino, showing off his new house, asks Guglielmo to suggest something ""never yet seen"" to depict in his saloon. Guglielmo wittily replies, ""Cause Liberality to be here depictured."" Ermino is so shamed that he completely changes his ways, becoming a liberal and courteous gentleman.
9.  **The King of Cyprus and the Gascon Lady (Elisa):** The first King of Cyprus is a cowardly and ignoble ruler who ignores wrongs. A Gascon gentlewoman, abused on her pilgrimage, seeks redress from him but is told it is useless. Instead of seeking justice, she decides to shame him. She tells the King she doesn't want redress for herself, but to learn from him how to patiently endure insults, as he is so adept at it. The King is roused from his lethargy, avenges her wrong, and becomes a just and rigorous ruler.
10. **Master Alberto of Bologna (Pampinea):** Master Alberto, a renowned 70-year-old physician, falls in love with the beautiful young widow, Madam Malgherida de' Ghisolieri. She and her friends mock him for his age. When invited by the ladies to explain his love, Master Alberto, with a witty analogy about choosing the best part of a leek (the white head) over the leaves, implies that while young men (leaves) are outwardly appealing, older men (the head) offer more substance and discernment. He suggests that, like the leek, they might choose him over younger, less substantial lovers. The ladies are abashed. The lady, acknowledging his wit, grants him her favor within honorable bounds.

**Day the First - Framing Story Conclusion:**

Filomena announces the theme for Day the Second: ""OF THOSE WHO AFTER BEING BAFFLED BY DIVERS CHANCES HAVE WON AT LAST TO A JOYFUL ISSUE BEYOND THEIR HOPE.""

The next day, Rinaldo finds his servant, and by a miracle, the highwaymen are caught and his goods returned. He returns home rich and safe.

8.  **Nastagio degli Onesti (Filomena):** Nastagio, a rich young man in Ravenna, loves a proud, cruel noblewoman who scorns him. He spends lavishly trying to win her. His friends advise him to leave Ravenna. He moves to a country estate. One Friday, in a pine forest, he witnesses a spectral hunt: a knight perpetually hunts, slays, and disembowels a naked woman (who was his cruel mistress in life) and feeds her heart to his dogs. The knight explains this is their eternal penance for her cruelty and his suicide. Nastagio, seeing this, arranges a banquet for his beloved and her family at the same spot the following Friday. The lady, witnessing the terrifying spectacle, realizes the fate awaiting her for her cruelty. Terrified, she immediately sends word to Nastagio that she will accept him as her husband. They marry and live happily. The incident makes all the ladies of Ravenna more amenable to their lovers.
9.  **Federigo degli Alberighi (Pampinea):** Federigo, a noble but impoverished Florentine, loves the virtuous Madam Giovanna, who is married. He spends all his wealth on her, ending up with only a small farm and his prized falcon. Giovanna's husband dies, leaving her a wealthy widow with a son. The son becomes ill and desperately desires Federigo's falcon for his recovery. Giovanna, torn between her son's health and Federigo's poverty (the falcon is his only remaining possession), visits him. Federigo, having nothing else to offer his beloved, kills and roasts his falcon for their dinner. When Giovanna asks for the falcon, he tearfully reveals what he has done. Giovanna first scolds him, then is deeply moved by his magnanimity. Her son dies. Urged by her brothers to remarry, she chooses Federigo, saying she prefers ""a man that lacketh of riches than riches that lack of a man."" She marries him, making him rich again, and they live happily.

**Day the Fifth - Framing Story Conclusion:**
Dioneo's story of Pietro di Vinciolo (which he will tell last for the day) is applauded. Fiammetta, the queen, crowns Elisa as the next queen, asking her to be beautiful in action as well as appearance. Emilia declares the theme for the next day (Day 6) will be open, to allow for rest from strict rules and greater variety. Elisa takes the ladies to the ""Ladies' Valley,"" where they bathe naked in a pristine lake. The young men, hearing of this, visit the valley themselves and also bathe (separately). They all reunite for supper. Elisa sings a plaintive song about the cruel bonds of love and her desire for freedom. They dance and retire for the night.

**Day the Sixth - Framing Story:**
Sunday morning, the company rises with the moon still in the middle of the sky. They walk, discussing the stories from the previous days. After the sun rises, they return to the palace for breakfast. After eating, they sing and dance, then some rest while others play games. At the appointed hour, they gather by the fountain. As the queen is about to call for the first story, a loud clamor erupts from the kitchen between Licisca and Tindaro, two servants. The queen summons them. Licisca, an older, fiery woman, refuses to let Tindaro speak. She argues that women are not simpletons; they know how to have affairs and cheat their husbands, who often delay marriage too long. She claims no woman goes ""a maid to her husband"" and that wives constantly trick their husbands. Dioneo, called upon to judge, immediately sides with Licisca, declaring her right and Tindaro an ass. The queen silences Licisca and Tindaro and sends them away. She then asks Filomena to begin the day's stories.

**Day the Sixth: Stories of Clever Responses and Escapes from Peril/Shame**

1.  **Madam Oretta (Filomena):** Madam Oretta, a noble and witty Florentine lady, is walking with a company of gentlemen. One gentleman offers to ""carry her a-horseback"" with one of the finest stories. He begins a truly good story but tells it so poorly, repeating words, making errors, and delivering it awkwardly, that it becomes unbearable. Madam Oretta, exasperated, interrupts him politely, saying, ""Sir, this horse of yours hath too hard a trot; wherefore I pray you be pleased to set me down."" The gentleman, understanding the witty rebuke, laughs, changes the subject, and stops his botched story.
2.  **Cisti the Baker (Pampinea):** Cisti, a rich baker with a noble spirit, observes Messer Geri Spina (Madam Oretta's husband) and papal ambassadors passing his bakehouse daily in the summer heat. He wants to offer them his excellent white wine but feels his low status prevents a direct invitation. He subtly places a fresh pail of water, a pitcher of his wine, and silver-bright beakers outside his door and conspicuously drinks it with great relish. Messer Geri, intrigued, eventually asks if it's good. Cisti invites them to taste. He personally serves them, refusing to let servants touch his precious wine. Messer Geri and the ambassadors are highly impressed. Later, Messer Geri invites Cisti to a banquet, but Cisti declines. Messer Geri sends a servant with a large flagon for Cisti's wine. Cisti tells the servant Messer Geri didn't send him. When the servant insists, Cisti says Messer Geri sent him ""to the Arno"" (river). Messer Geri realizes his servant brought too large a flagon for such fine wine. He sends a smaller, appropriate flask, which Cisti happily fills. Cisti then sends Messer Geri a whole small cask of the wine, saying he won't be his steward anymore.
3.  **Madam Nonna de' Pulci (Lauretta):** Bishop Antonio d'Orso of Florence is riding with Messer Dego della Ratta, the King's marshal. The marshal had previously paid a man 500 gilded silver coins to sleep with his beautiful wife (the bishop's niece). The bishop, pretending ignorance, points out Madam Nonna de' Pulci, a fresh, fair, witty lady, and asks the marshal if he thinks he could ""make a conquest of her."" Madam Nonna, realizing her honor is subtly being impugned due to the marshal's past scandal with her kinswoman, sharply retorts, ""Maybe, sir, he would not make a conquest of me; but, in any case, I should want good money."" Both the marshal and the bishop, recognizing the double entendre related to the marshal's past payment and the bishop's kinswoman, are shamed into silence.
4.  **Chichibio, Cook to Currado Gianfigliazzi (Neifile):** Currado Gianfigliazzi, a noble Florentine, catches a fine crane and orders his cook, Chichibio, to roast it for supper. Chichibio's lover, Brunetta, comes to the kitchen and demands a thigh of the crane. He initially refuses but, pressured by her threats, gives it to her. At supper, Currado notices the missing thigh and asks Chichibio. Chichibio immediately claims cranes have only one thigh and one leg. Currado, enraged, insists on proof the next morning, threatening severe punishment. The next morning, Currado takes Chichibio to a watercourse where cranes are often seen. Chichibio points out a dozen cranes standing on one leg (as they sleep). Currado shouts ""Ho! Ho!"" The cranes put down their other legs and fly off. Chichibio quickly retorts that Currado didn't shout ""Ho! Ho!"" to the crane last night, implying it would have put down its other leg then too. Currado, finding the reply comical, laughs, and his anger turns to mirth, saving Chichibio.
5.  **Messer Forese da Rabatta and Master Giotto the Painter (Pamfilo):** Messer Forese da Rabatta, a distinguished but ugly jurist, and Giotto, the great painter (also not handsome), are returning from their country estates in Mugello. They are caught in a sudden shower and borrow old, rusty cloaks and hats from a farmer. As they ride, drenched and muddy, Messer Forese, observing Giotto's disheveled state, jokingly asks if a stranger would believe him to be the world's finest painter. Giotto quickly retorts that a stranger might believe it ""whenas, looking upon you, he should believe that you knew your A B C."" Forese realizes his own equally poor appearance and Giotto's cleverness.
6.  **Michele Scalza and the Cadgers (Fiammetta):** Michele Scalza, a merry Florentine youth, debates with friends about the noblest and oldest Florentine families. He asserts that the ""Cadgers"" (professional beggars) of Santa Maria Maggiore are the best and oldest gentlemen in Florence, or even the Maremma. He wagers a supper on it. Neri Mannini accepts. Scalza argues that God made Cadgers first, when learning to draw, and others later, when He knew better. He points to their misshapen faces (long, broad, crooked noses, uneven eyes) as proof of their ""early draft"" status, making them the most ancient. The judge and all present laugh, declare Scalza the winner, confirming the Cadgers' dubious nobility.
7.  **Madam Filippa (Filostrato):** In Prato, a cruel statute condemns adulterous wives to be burned. Madam Filippa is caught by her husband, Rinaldo de' Pugliesi, with her lover. Rinaldo accuses her before the provost. Filippa, courageous and in love, insists on appearing. She argues that laws should be common and made with consent. This law, made only by men, is unjust, especially since women can satisfy ""many."" She asks her husband if she ever denied him her favors. Rinaldo admits she never did. Filippa then asks the provost what she should do with the ""remainder"" of her body after her husband's needs are met: should she cast it to the dogs, or give it to a gentleman who loves her? The townspeople, amused, agree she is right. The statute is modified to apply only to women who sell their favors. Filippa returns home triumphant.
8.  **Fresco and Ciesca (Emilia):** Fresco has a niece, Ciesca, who is beautiful but vain, proud, and perpetually critical of everyone, deeming them ""disagreeable."" One day, Ciesca returns home, puffing and blowing, complaining that the city is full of disagreeable people, and she cannot stand to see them. Fresco, annoyed by her airs, advises her, ""My lass... if disagreeable folk be so distasteful to thee as thou sayest, never mirror thyself in the glass, so thou wouldst live merry."" Ciesca, too foolish to understand his witty and direct criticism of her own ugliness of spirit, replies she will mirror herself like other women, remaining in her folly.
9.  **Guido Cavalcanti (Elisa):** In Florence, Guido Cavalcanti, a renowned logician, philosopher, and gentleman, is often withdrawn in abstract thought. Some mistakenly believe he is trying to prove God does not exist. Messer Betto Brunelleschi and his companions, seeing Guido by some marble tombs near San Giovanni, decide to ""plague him."" They ride up and ask, ""Guido, thou refusest to be of our company; but, harkye, whenas thou shalt have found that God is not, what wilt thou have accomplished?"" Guido, quickly seeing himself hemmed in, replies, ""Gentlemen, you may say what you will to me in your own house,"" and leaps over a tomb to escape. The gentlemen are puzzled. Messer Betto explains Guido's profound retort: the tombs are the ""houses of the dead,"" implying that these unlettered men, compared to the learned Guido, are worse than dead, thus ""here, we are in our own house."" They are ashamed and leave Guido in peace.
10. **Fra Cipolla (Dioneo):** Fra Cipolla, a jolly, cunning friar, visits Certaldo annually to collect alms. He boasts to the villagers that he will show them a feather from the Angel Gabriel. Two mischievous young men, Giovanni and Biagio, decide to prank him. While Fra Cipolla is dining, they go to his inn, find his lazy, disreputable servant, Guccio, flirting in the kitchen. They steal the ""feather"" (actually a parrot's tail feather) from Fra Cipolla's casket and replace it with coals. After none, Fra Cipolla begins his sermon. He dramatically recounts his travels and a list of absurd relics he's seen (finger of the Holy Ghost, Cherubim's nail, etc.), leading up to the Angel Gabriel's feather. Upon opening the casket and finding coals, he quickly improvises: he claims he brought the wrong casket, but it was divine will because the feast of St. Lawrence (who was burned on a gridiron) is soon. He declares the coals are from St. Lawrence's martyrdom and will protect those who are signed with them from fire. The simple villagers are impressed, make offerings, and get signed with the coals. The pranksters, who witnessed the improvisation, laugh, return the feather, and later find it served Fra Cipolla just as well.

**Day the Sixth - Framing Story Conclusion:**
Dioneo's story is met with much laughter. Elisa, the queen, crowns Dioneo as the new king. Dioneo, embracing his role, sets the theme for Day the Seventh: ""OF THE TRICKS WHICH, OR FOR LOVE OR FOR THEIR OWN PRESERVATION, WOMEN HAVE HERETOFORE PLAYED THEIR HUSBANDS, WITH OR WITHOUT THE LATTER'S COGNIZANCE THEREOF."" Some ladies initially object to the potentially unseemly topic, but Dioneo argues that in times of plague, when laws are relaxed, modest discourse on any subject for diversion is acceptable. He assures them their virtue is known and that denying such discourse might imply guilt. The ladies agree. Elisa takes the ladies to the beautiful ""Ladies' Valley"" again, where they swim naked. The young men later visit the valley and also bathe. They sup together, and Filomena sings a plaintive song about her love's longing and despair. They retire for the night.

**Day the Seventh - Framing Story:**
The next morning, the seneschal goes ahead to prepare the Ladies' Valley. The company rises early, enjoying the birdsong as they travel to the valley. They find it even more beautiful in the morning light. After a light breakfast, they sing. They dine by the lakelet, observing the fish. After dinner, some repose in curtained beds, while others enjoy pastimes. After none, they gather by the lake, and the king asks Emilia to begin the storytelling.

**Day the Seventh: Stories of Women's Tricks on Husbands**

1.  **Gianni Lotteringhi (Emilia):** Gianni, a simple-minded wool-comber, is easily tricked by his clever wife, Mistress Tessa, who loves Federigo. They arrange secret meetings at their country house using an ass's skull on a vine pole as a signal (muzzle towards Florence means Gianni's away, Federigo can come; muzzle towards Fiesole means Gianni's home). One night, Gianni unexpectedly returns while Federigo is expected. Tessa, hiding Federigo in the garden, pretends to be asleep when Federigo knocks. Gianni hears the knocking. Tessa convinces him it's a ""phantom"" and that they must exorcise it. She leads him to the door and performs a comical ""conjuration"" which Federigo (listening from the garden) overhears. The conjuration directs the ""phantom"" to the peach tree in the garden, where Federigo (who hadn't eaten due to the unexpected return) finds the capons and wine Tessa had hidden for their supper. Federigo sups at his ease, and later they laugh about the trick.
2.  **Peronella and the Vat (Filostrato):** Peronella, a beautiful but poor woman in Naples, takes a lover, Giannello, because her mason husband neglects her sexually. They meet when her husband goes to work. One morning, the husband unexpectedly returns. Peronella hides Giannello in a large vat in the shed. She opens the door and scolds her husband for returning early, accusing him of idleness. He explains he sold the old vat (which clutters the house) for five florins to a man waiting outside. Peronella quickly claims she already sold it for seven florins to an ""honest man"" (Giannello) who is currently inside the vat, checking its soundness. The husband, pleased with the higher price, sends away the other buyer. Giannello emerges from the vat, feigning ignorance, and complains it's not clean. The husband, eager to please, agrees to clean it. While the husband scrapes the vat from inside, Peronella leans into the opening, directing him, and positioning herself so Giannello can make love to her over her husband's head, unseen. Giannello finishes his pleasure, declares the vat clean, pays the husband seven florins, and takes the vat.
3.  **Fra Rinaldo and his Gossip (Elisa):** Rinaldo, a Sienese gentleman turned friar, loves his beautiful gossip (godmother to his child), Madam Agnesa, and seeks to seduce her. She initially resists, citing their spiritual kinship. He argues that he is less akin to the child than her husband, so if her husband can sleep with her, so can he. She, easily convinced, agrees. They frequently meet secretly. One day, her husband returns unexpectedly while Fra Rinaldo is in her chamber. The wife quickly hides Fra Rinaldo (stripped to his waistcoat) and her child. She opens the door, claiming Fra Rinaldo (their gossip) has miraculously cured their child of ""worms"" that were drawing near its heart, by conjuring them away, and that he is still holding the child. The simple husband, overjoyed, believes her and thanks Fra Rinaldo. Fra Rinaldo, now dressed and holding the child, completes the deception. The husband entertains him and his companion, entirely unaware of the trick.
4.  **Tofano and his Wife (Lauretta):** Tofano, a jealous husband in Arezzo, loves drinking. His wife, Madam Ghita, resents his jealousy and his sexual neglect. She encourages his drinking until he passes out, then secretly meets her lover. One night, Tofano feigns drunkenness to catch her. When she leaves to meet her lover, he locks her out. Upon her return, he refuses to open the door, threatening to shame her. Ghita, in turn, threatens to jump into a nearby well, making it appear he killed her in a drunken rage. To convince him, she throws a large stone into the well, creating a loud splash. Tofano, believing she has jumped, rushes out to save her. Ghita quickly slips into the house and locks him out. She then mocks him from the window. Neighbors intervene, blaming Tofano. Her kinsfolk arrive, beat Tofano, and take Ghita home. Tofano, suffering for his jealousy, eventually reconciles with his wife, promising never to be jealous again and to let her do as she pleases, provided she is discreet.
5.  **A Jealous Husband (Fiammetta):** A rich merchant in Rimini is excessively jealous of his beautiful wife, keeping her severely confined. She, feeling unjustly suspected, decides to give him cause for his jealousy. She discovers a hidden crack in the wall connecting her chamber to her handsome young neighbor's. They enlarge it and begin communicating, planning to meet. The wife tells her husband she wants to go to church on Christmas morning to confess and take communion. He, suspicious, agrees but insists she confess only to their chaplain or his appointed substitute. He then disguises himself as a priest, putting pebbles in his mouth to alter his voice, and hears her confession. She tells him she is enamored of a priest who visits her nightly, enters despite locked doors, and makes her husband fall asleep with special words. The husband, furious, returns home, pretending to leave for the night, but hides to catch the priest. The wife, understanding his plan, signals her lover to come via the roof. While the husband freezes all night guarding the door, she enjoys her lover. Later, he confronts her with her confession. She laughs, revealing she recognized him as the priest and that his ""confession"" was all true—he (as her husband) was the ""priest"" who visited her nightly. She mocks his jealousy, saying if she wanted to cuckold him, she could do it with a hundred eyes and he wouldn't know. The husband, shamed, gives up his jealousy, and she continues her affair openly and discreetly.
6.  **Madam Isabella (Pampinea):** Madam Isabella, a noble lady, takes a lover, Leonetto, and is also forced to submit to Messer Lambertuccio, a powerful, disagreeable gentleman who threatens to dishonor her. One day, at her country estate, her husband is away. Leonetto visits. Suddenly, Lambertuccio arrives. Isabella hides Leonetto behind the bed curtains. She receives Lambertuccio. As they are together, her husband unexpectedly returns. Isabella, realizing she has two men and Lambertuccio's horse is visible, tells Lambertuccio to take his naked dagger, descend the stairs with an angry air, and declare he will find his foe elsewhere. Lambertuccio complies. The husband, seeing Lambertuccio leave in a fury, asks his wife what happened. She claims an unknown young man fled into her room, pursued by Lambertuccio, and she prevented Lambertuccio from entering. The husband, believing her, praises her for preventing a murder and asks where the young man is. Leonetto emerges, trembling. The husband, still believing the fabricated story, escorts Leonetto safely home.
7.  **Lodovico and Madam Beatrice (Filomena):** Lodovico, a Florentine gentleman, falls in love with Madam Beatrice, wife of Messer Egano de' Gulluzzi of Bologna, based on hearsay. He takes service as a horseboy under the name Anichino in Egano's household to be near her. He becomes Egano's trusted servant. Beatrice, unaware of his love, plays chess with him. He feigns a sigh. When she asks, he confesses his true identity and love, begging her for pity. Beatrice, moved, reciprocates his love and promises to meet him that night. Egano, her husband, tired, goes to bed early. Beatrice leaves her chamber door open. Anichino enters. As they are about to make love, Beatrice wakes Egano and asks him who his most trusted servant is. He replies Anichino. Beatrice then tells him Anichino tried to seduce her earlier and suggested she meet him in the garden under the pine tree at midnight. She tells Egano to go in her clothes and veil to catch Anichino. Egano, believing Anichino's disloyalty, agrees. He goes to the garden in his wife's clothes. Anichino and Beatrice then make love. Afterward, Beatrice sends Anichino to the garden with a stick, instructing him to pretend to scold ""Beatrice"" for coming and to beat her. Anichino finds Egano and beats him soundly. Egano flees back to the chamber, complaining about the beating and scolding. Beatrice, feigning amusement, says Anichino merely tested her with words and him with deeds. Egano believes he has a true wife and loyal servant. Anichino and Beatrice continue their affair.
8.  **Arriguccio Berlinghieri and Madam Sismonda (Neifile):** Arriguccio, a jealous Florentine merchant, marries the noble Sismonda. She takes a lover, Ruberto. To meet him secretly, Sismonda ties a piece of twine to her toe, hanging out the window; Ruberto pulls it, and she pulls it back if her husband is awake, or lets go if he's asleep. One night, Arriguccio feels the twine, cuts it from her toe, ties it to his own, and waits. Ruberto pulls the twine. Arriguccio rushes out, armed. Ruberto, hearing the loud door, flees. Arriguccio pursues him, and they fight. Meanwhile, Sismonda realizes her trick is discovered. She calls her maid, persuades her to take her place in the bed, and hides. Arriguccio returns, beats the maid severely, cuts off her hair, believing it's his wife. He then locks her in and goes to tell his wife's brothers. The brothers and their mother come, furious. Sismonda, now dressed and calmly sewing, appears unharmed. Arriguccio is dumbfounded. Sismonda, realizing the opportunity, blames her husband, saying he's often drunk and probably slept with a h"
The Divine Comedy-Dante Alighieri,"The plot of the provided text, ""The Divine Comedy: Hell, Purgatory, and Paradise,"" follows a journey undertaken by the narrator, guided by various figures, through the realms of the afterlife.

**Part 1: Hell (Inferno)**

The journey begins with the **Narrator** finding himself lost in a dark and savage wood, having strayed from the ""path direct"" in the midway of his mortal life. Overwhelmed by fear, he sees a mountain illuminated by the sun, offering hope. However, his path is blocked first by a nimble, speckled **Panther**, then a hunger-mad **Lion**, and finally a lean, insatiable **She-wolf**, which drives him back down into a lower, darker space.

Here, he encounters a figure with a faint voice, whom he implores for mercy. The figure reveals himself to be **Virgil**, a renowned bard from Mantua, who lived in ancient Rome. The Narrator, recognizing Virgil, expresses profound admiration and begs for salvation from the She-wolf. Virgil explains that this beast allows no one to pass and will continue to torment until a special ""greyhound"" arrives to destroy her. Virgil offers to guide the Narrator by an ""another way,"" through the eternal space of Hell, where he will witness despairing shrieks and tormented spirits, and then through Purgatory, where souls dwell ""content in fire"" hoping for blessedness. He explains that a ""spirit worthier than I"" (Beatrice) must then lead the Narrator to Heaven, as Virgil, having lived before Christ, is considered a ""rebel to his law"" and cannot enter God's city. The Narrator eagerly accepts, asking to be led to ""Saint Peter's gate."" They set forth.

As they prepare to enter Hell, the Narrator expresses doubt about his worthiness, comparing himself unfavorably to Aeneas and Paul, who journeyed to the afterlife. Virgil, perceiving his ""vile fear,"" reassures him by revealing that a blessed and lovely lady named **Beatrice** descended from Heaven to Limbo (where Virgil resides) and implored him to aid the Narrator. Beatrice explained that a ""blessed dame"" in high heaven (implied to be the Virgin Mary) mourned the Narrator's straying, and another (Lucia) was dispatched by her to Beatrice to ask for help. Beatrice, motivated by love, then sought Virgil's assistance, promising to praise him before her Master in Heaven. Hearing this, the Narrator's courage is restored, and he reaffirms his commitment to the journey with Virgil.

They arrive at the Gate of Hell, inscribed with terrifying words, including ""All hope abandon ye who enter here."" Virgil guides the Narrator in. They are immediately assailed by a cacophony of sounds – sighs, lamentations, moans, and horrible languages – from the souls of those who lived without praise or blame, alongside angels who were neutral in the rebellion against God. These ""wretched souls"" are tormented by wasps and hornets, and their blood and tears are consumed by worms. They are neither accepted by Heaven nor Hell.

Next, they reach the river **Acheron**, where a throng of souls eagerly awaits passage. The ferryman, **Charon**, an old man with fiery eyes, initially refuses the living Narrator passage, but Virgil silences him by stating it is ""will'd Where will and power are one."" Charon then ferries the damned across the river, striking stragglers with his oar. The Narrator is overwhelmed by a violent earthquake and a vermilion flame, falling unconscious.

He awakens in the **First Circle of Hell (Limbo)**, where he hears only sighs. Virgil explains these are the souls of the unbaptized and virtuous pagans, including himself, who are not tormented but live in ""desiring without hope."" Virgil recounts how, early in his time in Limbo, **Christ** (referred to as a ""puissant one"") descended and rescued figures like Adam, Abel, Noah, Moses, Abraham, David, and Rachel, taking them to Heaven. They then encounter the esteemed poets **Homer, Horace, Ovid, and Lucan**, who welcome Virgil and include the Narrator as the sixth in their company. They proceed to a magnificent castle, where they find noble ancient heroes and philosophers, such as Electra, Hector, Aeneas, Caesar, Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle.

Leaving Limbo, they descend to the **Second Circle**, where **Minos**, a ghastly monster, judges each soul by coiling his tail. The Narrator is warned by Minos but again defended by Virgil. This circle punishes **Lust**. Souls are eternally whirled by a stormy blast, constantly clashing against each other. The Narrator sees historical and mythological figures like Semiramis, Dido, Cleopatra, Helen, Achilles, Paris, and Tristan. He speaks with **Francesca da Rimini** and Paolo, who recount their adulterous love, kindled while reading the story of Lancelot and Guinevere. The Narrator is so overcome with pity that he faints.

Upon reviving, they enter the **Third Circle**, punishing **Gluttony**. Here, a ceaseless, cold, and filthy rain falls, creating a putrid mire. The monstrous three-headed dog, **Cerberus**, guards the gluttons, tearing at them. Virgil silences Cerberus by throwing dirt into his mouths. They speak with **Ciacco** of Florence, who foretells the political strife and eventual downfall of Florence, mentioning that avarice, envy, and pride are its fatal sparks. He also tells the Narrator that other Florentine figures are deeper in Hell.

They proceed to the **Fourth Circle**, guarding **Avarice and Prodigality**. Here, souls are divided into two opposing groups, endlessly pushing huge weights against each other, shouting, ""Why holdest thou so fast?"" and ""And why castest thou away?"" Virgil explains their twisted minds misused wealth. The Narrator asks about the nature of **Fortune**, and Virgil describes her as a divine minister who distributes worldly goods and cannot be resisted by human wisdom.

They descend to the **Fifth Circle**, the **Stygian Marsh**, where the **Wrathful** are submerged in muddy waters, furiously attacking each other. Beneath the surface, the **Sullen** are also submerged, sighing and making bubbles. They are ferried across the marsh by **Phlegyas**, the wrathful boatman. During the crossing, a soul named **Filippo Argenti**, a proud Florentine, tries to accost the Narrator but is pushed back into the mire by Virgil. The Narrator wishes to see Argenti further tormented, and indeed, other wrathful souls set upon him.

They approach the **City of Dis**, with its iron walls and vermilion-glowing minarets (indicating eternal fire). Demons guard the gate, initially refusing them entry. Virgil goes to parley but is rebuffed, returning disheartened. He reassures the Narrator that divine aid is coming. Three **Furies** (Megaera, Alecto, and Tisiphone), with serpents for hair, appear on the tower, threatening to summon Medusa to turn the Narrator to stone. Virgil quickly covers the Narrator's eyes. A **Heavenly Messenger** arrives, causing a great wind and making spirits flee. He opens the gate with a touch of his wand, rebukes the demons, and departs.

Inside Dis, they find the **Sixth Circle**, a vast plain filled with fiery tombs, punishing **Heresy**. The Narrator speaks with **Farinata degli Uberti**, a Ghibelline leader, who questions his lineage and foretells the Narrator's exile from Florence. Another soul, **Cavalcante de' Cavalcanti**, rises from a tomb, tearfully asking about his son, Guido. The Narrator's delayed reply, caused by his thought on Farinata's prophecy, makes Cavalcante believe his son is dead, and he collapses. Farinata clarifies that the damned can foresee the future but have no knowledge of the present. The Narrator, remorseful, asks Farinata to tell Cavalcante that his son is alive.

They then move to the **Seventh Circle**, which punishes **Violence**, divided into three rounds. To understand its structure, Virgil explains the nature of sin: injury by force or fraud. Fraud is more displeasing to God.
The **First Round** (violence against neighbors) is a river of boiling blood, the **Phlegethon**. **Centaurs**, armed with arrows, guard it, shooting any soul that rises too high. The Narrator is carried across by the Centaur **Nessus**. He sees tyrants and murderers, including Alexander the Great and Dionysius, submerged to varying depths. Nessus points out others like Azzolino and Obizzo of Este.
The **Second Round** (violence against self) is a dark, thorny wood, where the souls of **Suicides** are transformed into gnarled trees, fed upon by Harpies. The Narrator breaks a twig, and blood and words issue forth from the tree, revealing the soul of **Pier della Vigna**, who explains how his soul became rooted there. He recounts his loyalty to Emperor Frederick II and his unjust downfall due to envy, leading him to suicide. They then witness **Profligates**, eternally chased and torn apart by black hounds.
The **Third Round** (violence against God, nature, and art) is a desert of burning sand, upon which flakes of fire rain down. Here, **Blasphemers** lie supine, **Sodomites** pace incessantly, and **Usurers** crouch. The Narrator speaks with **Capaneus**, a blasphemer, who defiantly continues to scorn God even in Hell. They then encounter **Brunetto Latini**, the Narrator's former mentor, among the Sodomites. Brunetto expresses affection and foretells the Narrator's future exile and fame. The Narrator also meets other Sodomites like Guidoguerra, Aldobrandi, and Rusticucci. They learn about various Florentine figures damned for this sin.

They descend into **Malebolge**, the **Eighth Circle**, which is a great gulf divided into ten concentric ditches (bolge).
The **First Bolgia** punishes **Panderers and Seducers**. They are naked and endlessly driven in two lines by horned demons with huge lashes. The Narrator recognizes Venedico Caccianemico and Jason.
The **Second Bolgia** punishes **Flatterers**, who are immersed in foul ordure. The Narrator sees Alessio Interminei and Thais.
The **Third Bolgia** punishes **Simoniacs** (those who sold spiritual offices). They are placed head-down in rock apertures, with only their legs sticking out, their feet burning with flames. The Narrator speaks with **Pope Nicholas III**, who mistakes him for Pope Boniface VIII and laments the corruption of the papacy, foretelling the damnation of Boniface and Pope Clement V. The Narrator denounces simony with a passionate speech.
The **Fourth Bolgia** punishes **Sorcerers and False Prophets**. Their heads are twisted backward, forcing them to walk with their tears streaming down their backs. The Narrator sees Amphiaraus, Tiresias, Aruns, and Manto (Virgil's ancestress). Virgil explains the founding of Mantua.

The Great Gatsby-F. Scott Fitzgerald,"Nick Carraway, the narrator, moves from the Middle West to West Egg, Long Island, in the spring of 1922 to learn the bond business. He rents a small house next door to a colossal mansion belonging to a mysterious man named Gatsby.

Nick visits his second cousin once removed, Daisy Buchanan, and her wealthy, aggressive husband, Tom Buchanan, at their extravagant home in fashionable East Egg. At their house, Nick meets Jordan Baker, a professional golfer. During dinner, a phone call from New York reveals that Tom has a mistress. Daisy acts cynical and tells Nick about her daughter's birth, expressing a wish for her to be a ""beautiful little fool."" After leaving the Buchanans, Nick sees Gatsby for the first time, standing on his lawn, stretching his arms towards a single green light at the end of a dock across the bay.

Tom takes Nick to the ""valley of ashes,"" a desolate industrial wasteland, where they stop at a garage owned by George Wilson. Tom's mistress, Myrtle Wilson, George's wife, appears. Myrtle is vital and sensuous, contrasting sharply with her spiritless husband. Tom arranges to meet Myrtle in New York. The three travel to New York (Myrtle in a separate car) and go to an apartment Tom keeps for Myrtle. At a small, raucous party there, Myrtle's sister Catherine and a couple named the McKees are present. Myrtle changes into an elaborate dress and becomes more haughty. Catherine reveals that Tom and Myrtle despise their respective spouses and want to marry, claiming Daisy is Catholic and doesn't believe in divorce (a lie, Nick knows). Myrtle recounts her first meeting with Tom and her disillusionment with George. Later, Tom breaks Myrtle's nose with his open hand when she repeatedly taunts him by shouting Daisy's name. Nick leaves the chaotic scene with Mr. McKee.

Gatsby hosts lavish, uninvited parties every weekend at his mansion. Nick, one of the few invited guests, attends one and, after mingling and hearing various rumors about Gatsby (a German spy, a man who killed someone, Kaiser Wilhelm's nephew), finally meets Gatsby. Gatsby is younger than Nick expected, speaks formally, and calls people ""old sport."" He recognizes Nick from the war. Nick and Jordan also encounter a man with owl-eyed spectacles in Gatsby's library, astonished that the books are real. After the party, a car crashes outside Gatsby's gate; the drunk driver is not the ""owl-eyed"" man, but an unidentified passenger.

Gatsby takes Nick to lunch in his opulent yellow car. During the drive, Gatsby tells Nick a fabricated story about his past: being from a wealthy Midwestern family (all dead), educated at Oxford, and a decorated war hero. He shows Nick a medal from Montenegro and an Oxford photo to support his claims. He also uses a ""white card"" to avoid a speeding ticket from a policeman. In New York, Gatsby introduces Nick to Meyer Wolfshiem, a gambler who fixed the 1919 World's Series and wears human molar cuff buttons. Wolfshiem praises Gatsby's character. Tom Buchanan then enters the restaurant, and Gatsby mysteriously disappears, leaving Nick alone with Wolfshiem. Jordan Baker later explains to Nick that Gatsby's story about being an ""Oxford man"" is untrue. She then reveals Gatsby's true purpose: he bought his mansion specifically to be across the bay from Daisy, whom he had known and loved as a young army officer in Louisville in 1917. Daisy, after a brief, desperate attempt to call off her wedding, married Tom Buchanan in 1919 and received a $350,000 pearl necklace. Tom had an affair shortly after their honeymoon. Gatsby wants Nick to invite Daisy to tea at his house so Gatsby can ""come over"" to see her.

Nick agrees to Gatsby's request. On the day of the tea, Gatsby is extremely nervous, sending his gardener to cut Nick's lawn and bringing flowers. Daisy arrives, and her reunion with Gatsby is initially awkward, almost disastrous, but quickly becomes joyful. Gatsby then invites Daisy and Nick to his house, revealing he spent three years earning the money for it, contradicting his earlier claim of inheritance. He gives Daisy a tour, showing off his luxurious possessions, including stacks of imported shirts, which make Daisy cry with emotion. Gatsby points out the green light at the end of Daisy's dock, a symbol of his long-held dream, which he now feels has lost its ""colossal significance"" because Daisy is physically present. Nick observes Gatsby’s initial bewilderment as the reality of Daisy struggles to match his immense illusion.

Gatsby abruptly stops his parties. His new servants, provided by Wolfshiem, are to prevent gossip because Daisy is now visiting him frequently. Gatsby asks Nick to join him, Daisy, and Jordan for lunch at Daisy's house. During lunch, Daisy openly expresses her love for Gatsby, which Tom notices, leading to a tense confrontation. Daisy introduces her three-year-old daughter, Pammy, to Gatsby, who seems surprised by her existence. Tom, realizing the extent of the affair, insists they all go to New York. In a deliberate act of power, Tom insists on driving Gatsby's yellow car, while Gatsby, Daisy, Nick, and Jordan are to follow in Tom's blue coupé. However, Daisy changes her mind and rides with Gatsby in his yellow car.

On the way to New York in Gatsby's car, Tom confronts Nick and Jordan about their knowledge of the affair. He then exposes Gatsby's illegal activities, revealing Gatsby sold grain alcohol through drugstores with a man named Walter Chase, whom Gatsby left to go to jail. They stop for gas at George Wilson's garage in the valley of ashes. George Wilson is visibly distressed, telling Tom he and Myrtle are moving West because he's discovered Myrtle's infidelity. Myrtle, meanwhile, is seen watching from an upstairs window, mistaking Jordan for Tom's wife and fixing her jealous gaze on her.

At the Plaza Hotel in New York, the confrontation escalates. Tom accuses Gatsby of trying to steal his wife. Gatsby insists Daisy never loved Tom and only married him because she was tired of waiting for Gatsby, who was poor. Daisy, under pressure, reluctantly admits she ""did love him once—but I loved you too"" to Gatsby. Tom then further exposes Gatsby's illicit businesses, calling him a ""common swindler."" Daisy, terrified and overwhelmed, withdraws her earlier statements of love and loses her nerve. Tom, feeling triumphant, tells Daisy to go home with Gatsby in Gatsby's car, implying the affair is over. Nick realizes it's his 30th birthday.

As Tom, Jordan, and Nick drive back in Tom's coupé, they pass the valley of ashes. Myrtle Wilson, having been locked in by her distraught husband and agitated by seeing Tom's yellow car earlier, runs out into the road and is struck and instantly killed by a speeding yellow car. Tom, Jordan, and Nick arrive at the scene of the accident. Tom feigns ignorance about the yellow car, telling Wilson that the yellow car was not his and that he was driving a blue coupé, effectively shifting suspicion to Gatsby. Tom carries the grieving Wilson into his office and then leaves with Nick and Jordan, sobbing about the ""God damned coward"" who didn't stop.

Back at the Buchanan's, Nick sees Tom and Daisy sitting together in the kitchen, seemingly conspiring and united. Nick realizes that Daisy was driving Gatsby's car when she hit and killed Myrtle, and that Gatsby intends to take the blame. Gatsby waits outside the Buchanan's house all night, hoping to protect Daisy, but Nick knows Daisy is safe inside with Tom, who is not thinking of her. Nick leaves Gatsby standing alone in the moonlight, ""watching over nothing.""

The next morning, Nick goes to Gatsby's house. Gatsby, dejected, tells Nick he had been an impoverished officer when he first met Daisy and had let her believe he was wealthy. He says he committed himself to a ""grail"" in pursuing her, but she eventually married Tom Buchanan, drawn by Tom's wealth and stability. Nick advises Gatsby to go away, as his car will be traced, but Gatsby refuses to leave Daisy.

Meanwhile, George Wilson, consumed by grief and convinced his wife was murdered by her lover, tells Michaelis (the coffee shop owner) that the eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg are the eyes of God, and that God sees everything. He then sets out to find the owner of the yellow car. By tracking the car's path and asking for Gatsby's house, Wilson eventually finds Gatsby floating in his swimming pool on a pneumatic mattress. Gatsby had been waiting for a phone call from Daisy and had instructed his chauffeur not to take out the yellow car, which needed repair. Wilson shoots Gatsby, killing him, and then kills himself.

The police and reporters swarm Gatsby's house. Catherine lies at the inquest to protect her sister's reputation. Nick feels a sense of responsibility for Gatsby, as no one else seems to care. He tries to contact Daisy and Tom, but they have left without a trace. He attempts to reach Meyer Wolfshiem, but Wolfshiem refuses to get involved, stating he ""cannot get mixed up in this thing now."" A call for Gatsby about illegal bond dealings further hints at his criminal connections.

Gatsby's father, Henry C. Gatz, arrives from Minnesota, a solemn old man who is both distraught and immensely proud of his son's achievements, showing Nick a picture of Gatsby's house and a childhood schedule of self-improvement. Klipspringer, the ""boarder,"" calls, not about the funeral, but to ask for his tennis shoes.

The funeral is poorly attended. Only Nick, Gatsby's father, and the ""owl-eyed"" man (who earlier marveled at Gatsby's library) are present, along with a few servants and the postman. The ""owl-eyed"" man expresses shock at the lack of attendees.

Nick decides to return West. Before leaving, he breaks off his relationship with Jordan Baker, who accuses him of being dishonest and a ""bad driver."" Nick later encounters Tom Buchanan on Fifth Avenue. Tom admits he told Wilson that Gatsby owned the yellow car, justifying his actions by saying Gatsby ""had it coming to him"" and had run over Myrtle without stopping. Nick concludes that Tom and Daisy are ""careless people"" who ""smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness,"" leaving others to clean up their mess.

Nick visits Gatsby's empty house one last time, erasing an obscene word scrawled on the steps. He reflects on Gatsby's unattainable dream, symbolized by the green light, and the way the past ceaselessly pulls people back."
The Iliad-Homer,"This summary details the plot of the provided text, ""The Iliad,"" strictly based on the information within the given books and without external knowledge.

**Book I: The Contention of Achilles and Agamemnon**
The narrative begins in the tenth year of the siege of Troy. The Greeks have sacked neighboring towns and captured two beautiful women: Chryseïs, allotted to Agamemnon, and Briseïs, allotted to Achilles. Chryses, a priest of Apollo and father of Chryseïs, arrives at the Greek camp with gifts to ransom his daughter. Agamemnon insolently refuses and dismisses him. Chryses then prays to Apollo for vengeance. In response, Apollo inflicts a pestilence on the Greeks.

Achilles calls a council, encouraging the seer Chalcas to reveal the cause of the plague. Chalcas attributes it to Agamemnon's refusal to return Chryseïs. Agamemnon, enraged but compelled, agrees to send Chryseïs back. However, in an act of revenge, he seizes Briseïs from Achilles. This infuriates Achilles, who withdraws himself and his Myrmidon forces from the Greek army.

Achilles complains to his mother, the goddess Thetis, recounting the insult. Thetis, sympathetic to her son's plight, supplicates Jupiter to render the Greeks sensible of the wrong by granting victory to the Trojans. Jupiter, granting her request, incenses his wife Juno. A heated debate ensues between Jupiter and Juno, which is eventually pacified by their son, Vulcan. The events of this book span twenty-two days: nine during the plague, one for the council and quarrel, and twelve for Jupiter's absence with the Æthiopians before Thetis presents her petition.

**Book II: The Trial of the Army, and Catalogue of the Forces**
While the mortal leaders sleep, Jupiter, intent on honoring Achilles' request to bring woe upon the Greeks, sends a deceitful dream to Agamemnon. The dream, disguised as Nestor, persuades Agamemnon that he can conquer Troy immediately, as the gods have ceased their contention. Agamemnon is deluded by this vision and, upon waking, resolves to test the morale of his army.

He first consults his council of princes, revealing his plan to propose a return to Greece to the soldiers, expecting the chiefs to stop the resulting mass exodus. He then assembles the entire Greek host and delivers a speech suggesting they abandon the long, unsuccessful war and sail home. The disheartened Greek soldiers enthusiastically agree and rush to prepare their ships for departure.

Juno, seeing the Greeks about to abandon the siege, sends Pallas (Minerva) to prevent their flight. Minerva finds Ulysses, who is also distraught, and urges him to stop the retreat. Ulysses, taking Agamemnon's scepter, moves through the ranks. He uses persuasion and praise on the leaders, but uses physical force and harsh words to subdue common soldiers. He particularly chastises Thersites, a loud and ugly common soldier who openly criticizes Agamemnon and the war, striking him with the scepter.

The assembly is recalled. Ulysses delivers a speech, reminding them of an omen involving a serpent devouring a bird's nine offspring at Aulis nine years prior, interpreted by Chalcas as a sign that Troy would fall in the tenth year. Nestor then advises Agamemnon to organize the troops by their nations for battle. Agamemnon agrees, and the Greeks prepare for renewed combat.

The narrative then provides an extensive ""Catalogue of the Ships,"" detailing all the Greek forces, their leaders, and their cities of origin. Meanwhile, Iris, sent by Jove, warns the Trojans of the Greek advance. She appears to Priam in the form of Polites and urges Hector to gather all his forces. The Trojans also assemble their army, which includes many auxiliary nations, and a ""Catalogue of the Trojans"" is provided, listing their leaders and lands.

**Book III: The Duel of Menelaus and Paris**
The armies advance, the Trojans with shouts and the Greeks silently. The beauteous Paris, prominent in the Trojan vanguard, challenges the bravest Greek to single combat. Menelaus, seeing Paris, eagerly leaps from his chariot to fight. Paris, however, shrinks back in fear and retreats into the Trojan ranks. Hector fiercely reproaches Paris for his cowardice, reminding him that his abduction of Helen caused the war.

Paris, stung by the rebuke, accepts the challenge and proposes a single combat between himself and Menelaus to decide the war, with Helen and her treasures as the prize. Hector conveys this proposal to the Greeks. Menelaus readily accepts, suggesting that King Priam should oversee the oaths due to the untrustworthiness of his sons.

Both armies agree and prepare for the duel. Iris, disguised as Laodice, goes to Helen, who is weaving her sad story into a golden tapestry. Iris tells Helen to witness the combat. Helen, moved by thoughts of Menelaus and her homeland, goes to the Scaean gate, where old Priam and the Trojan elders sit. Priam asks Helen to identify prominent Greek chiefs, and she points out Agamemnon, Ulysses, and Ajax. She laments the absence of her brothers, Castor and Pollux, unaware they are dead.

Heralds bring lambs for sacrifice. Priam and Agamemnon swear solemn oaths to the gods regarding the conditions of the duel. Priam then returns to Troy, unable to watch the fight. Hector and Ulysses mark the ground for the combat. Paris wins the lot to throw first.

The two heroes arm themselves. Paris throws his spear, which strikes Menelaus's shield but does not pierce it. Menelaus then throws his spear, piercing Paris's shield, corslet, and garment, but Paris dodges the final blow. Menelaus then draws his sword, which shatters on Paris's helmet. Menelaus seizes Paris by the helmet crest and begins to drag him. Venus intervenes unseen, breaks the helmet strap, and shrouds Paris in a cloud, transporting him safely to his apartment in Troy.

Menelaus, unable to find Paris, rages on the field. Venus, disguised, then fetches Helen from the Scaean gate and brings her to Paris, who is already in his room. Helen initially scolds Paris but, under threat from Venus, joins him. Agamemnon then declares Menelaus the victor and demands the return of Helen and the agreed-upon fine. The Greeks cheer in agreement.

**Book IV: The Breach of the Truce, and the First Battle**
The gods convene on Olympus. Jupiter, noting Venus's rescue of Paris, questions whether to continue the war or make peace. Juno, still fiercely determined to destroy Troy, angrily reminds him of her efforts and sacrifices. Jupiter reluctantly agrees to allow Troy's destruction in exchange for his future right to destroy Juno's favored cities. He sends Minerva to break the truce established for the duel.

Minerva, disguised as Laodocus, finds Pandarus among the Trojans and persuades him to shoot Menelaus with an arrow, promising him glory. Pandarus, using his polished bow, shoots an arrow. Minerva, however, diverts the arrow to only wound Menelaus in the belt, preventing a fatal injury. Agamemnon, seeing Menelaus bleed, expresses great distress and fears for the Greek army, but Menelaus assures him it's not a fatal wound. Machaon, the physician, is summoned and extracts the arrow, applying a soothing balm.

The Trojans, seeing Menelaus wounded and the truce broken, rush forward. Agamemnon moves through the Greek ranks, rallying his troops, praising the brave (like Idomeneus and the Ajaxes) and reproaching the timid. He particularly commends Nestor for his organized battle formations. He also reproves Ulysses and Diomed for their initial hesitation, who then rejoin the fight with renewed vigor.

The battle joins with immense clamor. Antilochus kills Echepolus, but Elephenor is killed trying to strip him. Ajax kills Simoisius. Ulysses kills Democoon, causing a temporary Trojan retreat. Apollo then rallies the Trojans, reminding them that Achilles is not fighting. The battle resumes fiercely, with many heroes falling on both sides, including Diores (killed by Pyrus) and Pyrus (killed by Thoas). The field becomes a scene of widespread slaughter.

**Book V: The Acts of Diomed**
Minerva inspires Diomed, making him shine with divine fire and rage through the battle. He kills Phegeus and then Idæus (who is saved by Vulcan). Minerva then persuades Mars to withdraw from the field. Diomed continues his rampage, killing Odius, Phæstus, Scamandrius, Phereclus, Pedaeus, and Hypsenor.

Pandarus wounds Diomed with an arrow from afar, but the wound is superficial. Diomed retreats to his chariot, where Sthenelus extracts the arrow. Diomed prays to Pallas, who heals him, gives him the ability to discern gods from mortals, and instructs him to attack only Venus if she enters the fight.

Diomed returns to battle with renewed fury, killing Astynous, Hypenor, Abas, Polyidus, Xanthus, and Thoon. Æneas, seeing Diomed's prowess, persuades Pandarus to join him in his chariot against Diomed. Sthenelus warns Diomed of their approach, but Diomed refuses to retreat and instructs Sthenelus to seize Æneas's immortal horses if he falls.

Pandarus throws his spear, which strikes Diomed's shield but does not pierce it. Diomed then throws his spear, guided by Pallas, killing Pandarus by piercing his face. Æneas attempts to protect Pandarus's body, but Diomed throws a massive stone, gravely wounding Æneas in the hip. Venus, seeing her son, rescues him by covering him with her veil. Diomed, recognizing Venus, pursues and wounds her hand with his spear. Venus, shrieking, drops Æneas and flees to Olympus, where she complains to Jove. Jove tells her to leave war to Mars and Pallas. Apollo then rescues Æneas, carrying him to Troy for healing, and creates a phantom of Æneas to rally the Trojans.

Sarpedon reproaches Hector for his inaction, spurring him to rally the Trojans. Hector, spurred, charges back into battle with Mars by his side. Diomed, seeing Mars, advises the Greeks to retreat slowly. Hector then kills Anchialus and Mnesthes. Ajax kills Amphius. Tlepolemus challenges Sarpedon. They duel, and Tlepolemus kills Sarpedon's horse Pedasus. Sarpedon kills Tlepolemus with a spear, but Jove saves his son from immediate death. Ulysses avenges Tlepolemus by killing several Lycians.

A fierce battle rages over Sarpedon's body. Glaucus, wounded earlier, prays to Apollo for healing, which is granted. He then rallies the Trojans and Hector to defend Sarpedon's body. Jove, to honor Sarpedon, covers the field in darkness. The Greeks eventually secure Sarpedon's armor, and Patroclus takes it. Jove commands Apollo to retrieve Sarpedon's body, cleanse it, anoint it, and have Sleep and Death carry it to Lycia for proper burial.

Juno and Minerva descend to resist Mars. Minerva incites Diomed, who, with Pallas's aid, wounds Mars in the groin. Mars bellows in pain and flees to Olympus, where he complains to Jove. Jove rebukes Mars for his warlike nature but has Pæon heal him. Juno and Pallas return to Olympus.

**Book VI: The Episodes of Glaucus and Diomed, and of Hector and Andromache**
With the gods withdrawing, the Greeks begin to prevail. Ajax kills Acamas. Diomed kills Axylus and his servant Calesius. Euryalus kills Dresus and the twin sons of Bucolion. Polypoetes kills Astyalus. Ulysses kills Pidytes. Teucer kills Aretaon. Nestor's son kills Ablerus. Agamemnon kills Elatus. Eurypylus kills Melanthius.

Menelaus captures Adrastus, who pleads for mercy and offers ransom. Agamemnon, however, intervenes and ruthlessly kills Adrastus, demanding no Trojan be spared. Nestor urges the Greeks to continue fighting rather than stripping the dead.

Helenus, a Trojan augur, advises Hector to rally the Trojans and then return to the city to instruct his mother Hecuba and the Trojan matrons to offer prayers and gifts (a robe and twelve heifers) to Minerva, hoping to appease her and stop Diomed's rampage. Hector, after rallying his troops, leaves for Troy.

Meanwhile, Glaucus and Diomed meet between the armies. Diomed questions Glaucus's identity, stating he avoids fighting gods. Glaucus recounts his illustrious mortal lineage, tracing back to Sisyphus and Bellerophon, who performed heroic deeds in Lycia. Diomed then realizes that their grandfathers, Oeneus and Bellerophon, were guest-friends. To honor this ancestral bond, they agree not to fight each other and exchange armor. Glaucus exchanges his golden armor for Diomed's brass armor, a less valuable exchange.

Hector arrives at the Scaean Gate in Troy, where women and elders question him. He instructs Hecuba about the offerings to Minerva. Hecuba and the matrons proceed to Minerva's temple, lay a veil before the goddess, and pray for her mercy, but Minerva denies their prayers.

Hector then goes to Paris's house, finding him polishing his armor with Helen and her handmaids nearby. Hector sternly reproaches Paris for his idleness. Paris accepts the rebuke, stating he was lost in grief but is now ready to return to battle. Helen expresses self-blame for the war and her wish for death.

Hector refuses Helen's offer for him to rest. He seeks his wife Andromache and their son Astyanax at the Scaean Gate. Andromache tearfully pleads with him not to return to battle, fearing he will die and leave her and their son helpless. She suggests he defend the walls from a safer position. Hector explains that honor and duty compel him to fight, as he cannot bear the shame of avoiding battle, especially knowing Troy's eventual fall and Andromache's impending enslavement. He then embraces and blesses his son, praying for him to become a renowned warrior. Andromache, grieving, returns home. Hector and Paris, now fully armed and eager, return to the battlefield.

**Book VII: The Single Combat of Hector and Ajax**
Hector and Paris return to the battle, reinvigorating the Trojan forces. Hector kills Eioneus, Paris kills Menestheus, and Glaucus kills Iphinous. Minerva, seeing the renewed Trojan success, descends from Olympus. Apollo meets her near the Scaean Gate, and they agree to halt the general battle for the day. Helenus, the Trojan seer, divining the gods' will, advises Hector to challenge the bravest Greek to a single combat.

Hector issues the challenge, proposing that the victor take the loser's armor, but return the body for proper burial. The Greeks are initially silent and afraid. Menelaus, shamed, volunteers but is restrained by Agamemnon, who reminds him of Hector's superior strength. Nestor then rebukes the Greeks for their cowardice and recounts his own youthful prowess. Nine Greek chiefs, including Diomed, the two Ajaxes, Idomeneus, Meriones, Eurypylus, Thoas, and Ulysses, then volunteer.

Lots are cast to decide who will fight Hector, and the lot falls upon Ajax Telamon. Ajax rejoices, arms himself, and steps forward to meet Hector. They exchange boasts. Hector throws his spear first, striking Ajax's seven-layered shield but failing to pierce it. Ajax then throws his spear, piercing Hector's shield and corslet, but Hector manages to avoid a fatal blow. They then close in fierce combat, exchanging blows with stones. Hector hurls a large stone at Ajax's shield, and Ajax hurls an even larger one, striking Hector and knocking him down, though Apollo revives him.

As they are about to draw swords for closer combat, the heralds Idæus (Trojan) and Talthybius (Greek) intervene, stopping the fight due to nightfall. Hector and Ajax, respecting the truce, exchange gifts: Hector gives Ajax a silver-studded sword, and Ajax gives Hector a purple belt. They then return to their respective armies.

The Greeks hold a council. Nestor advises them to burn their dead and, to protect their fleet, build a strong fortification of a wall, deep trench, gates, and palisades around their camp. At Troy, Priam calls a council. Antenor proposes returning Helen and her treasures to the Greeks to end the war, but Paris refuses to return Helen, only offering her treasures. Priam then proposes sending a herald to the Greeks with Paris's offer and requesting a truce for burning the dead.

The next morning, Idæus presents the offer to the Greeks. Diomed vehemently rejects Paris's wealth and Helen, asserting that Troy is destined to fall. The Greeks acclaim his words. Agamemnon accepts only the truce for burial. Both armies then gather and burn their dead. Afterwards, the Greeks build their proposed fortification. Neptune is angered that the Greeks built a wall without consulting the gods, but Jupiter assures him that he will destroy it after the war. Both armies feast through the night, but Jove sends thunder and lightning, disheartening the Trojans.

**Book VIII: The Second Battle, and the Distress of the Greeks**
At dawn, Jupiter convenes a council of the gods on Olympus. He forbids any deity from intervening in the battle, threatening to cast anyone who disobeys into Tartarus and demonstrating his supreme power by claiming he could lift the entire world with his golden chain. Minerva obtains permission to at least offer counsel to the Greeks.

Jupiter then travels to Mount Ida and, from there, weighs the fates of Greece and Troy in his golden scales; the Greek side sinks. He sends thunder and lightning, striking terror into the Greeks and forcing them to retreat. Nestor's horse is wounded by Paris, leaving the old hero vulnerable. Diomed rescues Nestor, calling to Ulysses who flees to the ships. Diomed takes Nestor into his chariot (pulled by Æneas's captured horses) and confronts Hector. Diomed throws his spear, missing Hector but killing his charioteer, Eniopeus. Hector appoints Archeptolemus as his new charioteer. As Diomed attempts another attack, Jove sends a lightning bolt in front of his chariot, forcing him and Nestor to retreat. Hector pursues them, mocking Diomed.

Hector boasts of his impending victory and plans to burn the Greek ships that night. Juno, distressed, urges Neptune to intervene, but Neptune refuses to defy Jove. Hector then leads the Trojans, driving the Greeks back through their trench and behind their new wall. Agamemnon, distraught, rallies his troops with a prayer to Jove. Jove, moved, sends an eagle with a fawn as an omen, encouraging the Greeks.

The Greeks rally. Diomed charges first, killing Agelaus, followed by the Atridae, Ajaxes, Idomeneus, Meriones, and Teucer. Teucer, protected by Ajax's shield, kills several Trojans with his arrows. Agamemnon praises Teucer and promises him rewards. Teucer aims at Hector twice, missing him but killing other Trojan chiefs. Hector, enraged, throws a stone at Teucer, breaking his bowstring and disabling him. Ajax shields Teucer, who is carried off.

The Trojans, re-energized, push the Greeks back towards their ships. Juno and Minerva again prepare to intervene, but Jove sends Iris to warn them of severe punishment if they defy him. The goddesses reluctantly retreat. Jupiter returns to Olympus, rebukes Juno and Minerva, and reaffirms his plan: Hector will continue to win until Patroclus is slain, after which Achilles will rise and Hector will fall, leading to Troy's destruction.

Night falls, ending the battle. The Trojans, victorious, decide to camp on the plain outside the Greek fortifications, lighting numerous fires to prevent the Greeks from escaping by sea. Hector commands them to forage, refresh, and maintain watch, boasting that they will crush the Greeks at dawn and burn their fleet.

**Book IX: The Embassy to Achilles**
The Greeks are overcome with fear and despair after their defeat. Agamemnon, weeping, calls a council and proposes abandoning the siege and returning home. Diomed fiercely opposes this, condemning Agamemnon's cowardice and declaring he will stay and fight alone if necessary. Nestor praises Diomed's spirit and advises Agamemnon to call a council of elders.

In the council, Nestor suggests sending an embassy to Achilles to appease his wrath. Agamemnon agrees, offering an immense array of gifts: ten talents of gold, twenty shining vases, seven tripods, twelve prize-winning horses, seven beautiful Lesbian captives (including Briseïs, whom he solemnly swears he never touched), and promises more riches, one of his daughters in marriage, and seven wealthy cities after Troy's fall.

Nestor selects Phoenix, Ajax, and Ulysses as ambassadors, accompanied by heralds. They journey to Achilles' tent, where they find him playing the lyre with Patroclus. Achilles welcomes them warmly and offers them a feast. After the meal, Ulysses delivers Agamemnon's offer and passionately pleads for Achilles to return to battle, emphasizing the dire state of the Greeks and Hector's rampage.

Achilles, however, remains unyielding. He fiercely rejects Agamemnon's gifts and reconciliation, expressing his deep-seated hatred for the king's deceit and pride. He recounts his unrewarded labors and declares his intention to sail home to Phthia in three days. He reiterates his mother Thetis's prophecy that he faces a choice between a short, glorious life at Troy or a long, inglorious life at home, and says he now chooses the latter. He advises the Greeks to do the same. Achilles tells Phoenix he can stay with him.

Phoenix, weeping, recounts his own past as an exile taken in by Peleus, Achilles' father, and how he raised Achilles. He urges Achilles to temper his rage and recalls the story of Meleager, who refused to fight for his city until it was nearly overwhelmed, ultimately fighting for lesser rewards. Achilles thanks Phoenix but still refuses, stating he will not fight until Hector's forces reach his own ships and threaten them with fire.

Ajax then directly scolds Achilles, criticizing him for his stubbornness over a single woman when greater wrongs are often forgiven. Achilles replies that his rage is still too great. The ambassadors return to Agamemnon's tent. Ulysses reports Achilles' firm refusal. Diomed advises against further attempts to persuade Achilles and urges the Greeks to prepare for battle at dawn, with Agamemnon leading. The Greeks then take refreshment and sleep.

**Book X: The Night-Adventure of Diomed and Ulysses**
Agamemnon, consumed by anxiety over the Trojan fires and the dire situation of the Greeks, cannot sleep. He rises, arms himself, and decides to consult Nestor. Menelaus, also sleepless, meets him, and they agree to wake other key chiefs. Agamemnon goes to Nestor, finding him awake and armed. Nestor agrees to call a council and suggests waking Ulysses, Diomed, Meges, and Ajax the Lesser. He also sends others to wake Ajax the Greater and Idomeneus.

Nestor then wakes Ulysses and Diomed. They gather at the Greek fortifications with the other chiefs and guards. Nestor proposes a dangerous spy mission into the Trojan camp to gather intelligence. Diomed volunteers and chooses Ulysses as his companion, praising his wisdom and Pallas's favor. They arm themselves, and Minerva sends a heron as a good omen.

Meanwhile, Hector holds a council, offering Achilles' chariot and immortal horses as a reward to any Trojan who will spy on the Greek camp. Dolon, a swift but unattractive Trojan, volunteers, extracting a promise from Hector. He sets out dressed in a wolf's hide.

Ulysses and Diomed spot Dolon. They let him pass, then ambush and capture him. Dolon, terrified, begs for his life and reveals Hector's plans and the disposition of the Trojan and auxiliary forces, including the newly arrived Thracian king Rhesus and his splendid white horses. Diomed, having extracted the information, kills Dolon, preventing his future espionage. They hang Dolon's spoils on a tree as an offering to Pallas.

Diomed and Ulysses proceed to the Thracian camp. Ulysses spots Rhesus's horses and signals Diomed. Diomed, inspired by Pallas, slaughters Rhesus and twelve of his men in their sleep. Ulysses drags the bodies away and leads the immortal horses back. Pallas appears to Diomed, urging him to return. They swiftly ride back to the Greek camp, where Nestor recognizes them by the sound of the horses. Ulysses recounts their successful mission. The Thracian horses are brought to Diomed's stalls, and the heroes cleanse themselves and offer libations to Pallas.

**Book XI: The Third Battle, and the Acts of Agamemnon**
At dawn, Eris (Discord), sent by Jove, descends to the Greek fleet, inciting a fierce battle. Agamemnon, fully armed in magnificent divine armor, leads the Greeks. Juno and Pallas encourage them. Jove, observing, sends red drops of blood as a grim omen. The Trojans, led by Hector, Polydamas, and Æneas, also advance.

The battle rages fiercely and equally in the morning. Agamemnon then unleashes a powerful rampage, killing Bienor, Oïleus, two sons of Priam (Isus and Antiphus), and the treacherous sons of Antimachus, refusing their pleas for ransom. He drives the Trojans back towards their city walls.

Jove sends Iris to Hector, instructing him to retreat from the front while Agamemnon is raging, but to return to battle when Agamemnon is wounded and withdraws. Hector obeys. Agamemnon kills Iphidamas, who wounds him in the arm. Coon, Iphidamas's brother, then wounds Agamemnon in the arm. Agamemnon, despite his wound, kills Coon. However, the pain of his wound forces Agamemnon to retreat to the ships, exhorting his troops to fight on.

Seeing Agamemnon withdraw, Hector, with renewed vigor, rallies the Trojans and charges, killing many Greeks. Ulysses and Diomed stand together to resist him, killing Thymbraeus and Molion, and then the sons of Merops and Agastrophus. Paris, from behind a monument, shoots Diomed in the foot with an arrow. Diomed, though dismissive of the wound, is forced to retreat, with Ulysses extracting the arrow.

Ulysses, now isolated, is surrounded by Trojans. He fights bravely, killing several, but is wounded by Socus. Ulysses kills Socus in return but is hard-pressed and calls for help. Menelaus hears his cry and brings Ajax to his rescue. They drive off the Trojans and carry the wounded Ulysses to his chariot. Ajax continues fighting.

Hector, elsewhere on the field, continues his slaughter. Paris wounds Machaon, the physician, with an arrow. Idomeneus tells Nestor to convey Machaon to the ships for treatment. Nestor takes Machaon in his chariot. Hector's charioteer, Cebriones, points out Ajax's continued resistance. Hector turns to confront Ajax, but Jove strikes Ajax with fear, forcing him to slowly retreat. Eurypylus tries to help Ajax but is wounded by an arrow from Paris.

Patroclus, having seen Machaon taken from the field, asks Achilles about the wounded warrior. Achilles sends him to Nestor's tent to inquire. Nestor, in his tent, recounts the numerous Greek losses and passionately laments Achilles' absence. He urges Patroclus to persuade Achilles to fight, or at least to lead the Myrmidons himself, clad in Achilles' armor, to frighten the Trojans. Patroclus is moved and, on his return, encounters the wounded Eurypylus. He takes Eurypylus to his tent and tends to his wound.

**Book XII: The Battle at the Grecian Wall**
The Greeks have been driven back behind their newly constructed wall and trench. The text mentions that this wall, built without proper sacrifices, is destined to be destroyed by Neptune and Apollo after the war. Hector, fierce as a wild beast, leads the Trojans towards the wall. The Trojan horses hesitate at the deep trench, which is filled with sharpened stakes.

Polydamas advises Hector to abandon their chariots and attack the wall on foot, dividing their army into five battalions. Hector agrees and his troops dismount. Asius, however, ignores this advice and drives his chariot directly to one of the gates. He is bravely repelled by two Lapith chiefs, Polypoetes and Leonteus, who fight like mighty trees. Asius, frustrated, complains to Jove about his ill fortune.

Meanwhile, an omen appears: an eagle carrying a serpent. The serpent wounds the eagle, which drops its prey among the Trojans and flies away. Polydamas interprets this as a sign that they will breach the wall but suffer heavy losses and fail to capture the ships, and advises retreat. Hector furiously rejects this, asserting his faith in Jove's command for victory and threatening any who disobey.

Hector then leads the assault on the wall. Jove aids the Trojans with a whirlwind. The Trojans undermine the wall and pull down the palisades. Sarpedon, inspired by Jove, makes the first breach, tearing away stones from the rampart. Teucer wounds Glaucus in the arm, forcing him to retreat. Sarpedon kills Alcmaon and continues his rampage. Ajax wounds Sarpedon, but Jove protects his son. Sarpedon rallies his Lycians to press the attack. Hector, with Jove's aid, hurls a massive stone at the gates, shattering them. The Trojans pour through the breach and rush into the Greek camp towards the ships.

**Book XIII: The Fourth Battle Continued, in Which Neptune Assists the Greeks; The Acts of Idomeneus**
Jove, having granted the Trojans success, turns his attention away from the battlefield, leaving the combatants to their fate. Neptune, observing the Greek's distress and Jove's absence, rises from the sea. Disguised as Calchas, he inspires the Ajaxes and other Greek chiefs, filling them with renewed strength and urging them to make a stand against Hector. The Greeks rally and form a tight phalanx.

Hector continues his charge. Meriones throws a spear at Deiphobus, but it breaks. Teucer kills Imbrius, and Hector, aiming for Teucer, kills Amphimachus instead. Ajax and Teucer strip the bodies, and Ajax lops off Imbrius's head, throwing it towards Hector. Neptune, enraged by Amphimachus's death, appears to Idomeneus, disguised as Thoas, and urges him to join the fight. Idomeneus, after retrieving a new spear from his tent, returns to battle with Meriones.

Idomeneus kills Othryoneus, a Trojan who had come to Troy seeking Cassandra's hand. He then kills Asius and his charioteer. Deiphobus attacks Idomeneus, missing him but killing Hypsenor. Idomeneus then kills Alcathous, Anchises' son-in-law. Deiphobus, grieving, calls Æneas to help him avenge Alcathous. Æneas, who had been holding back due to a slight from Priam, is moved and joins the fight against Idomeneus. A fierce struggle erupts over Alcathous's body.

Idomeneus kills OEnomas. Deiphobus wounds Ascalaphus. Meriones wounds Deiphobus in the arm, and Polites helps him retreat. Æneas kills Aphareus, and Antilochus kills Thoon. Meriones wounds Adamas. Helenus wounds Deipyrus. Menelaus wounds Helenus in the hand with a spear and kills Pisander with his sword. Paris kills Harpalion with an arrow, and Meriones finishes him. Paris then wounds Euchenor with an arrow.

Hector remains fixed in the center, where the Greek wall was breached. The Locrian archers, led by Ajax the Lesser, provide covering fire. Polydamas, seeing the Trojans struggling, advises Hector to call a council and consider retreating to the city. Hector, after some initial hesitation, agrees to rally his chiefs. He reproaches Paris for his idleness, who then returns to the thickest fight with Hector. They regroup and charge, but Ajax confronts Hector, defying him and blaming Jove for the Greek's distress. The book ends with their exchange of challenges, the armies in a stand-off.

**Book XIV: Juno Deceives Jupiter by the Girdle of Venus**
Nestor, hearing the increasing clamor from the battle, leaves the wounded Machaon in his tent and goes to investigate. He sees the Greek wall in ruins and the army in flight. He meets Agamemnon, Ulysses, and Diomed, who are all wounded. Agamemnon, in despair, proposes abandoning the siege and sailing home under cover of night. Ulysses fiercely rejects this, shaming Agamemnon for such a cowardly suggestion. Diomed advises that even though wounded, the kings should return to the front to encourage the troops, staying out of direct combat. The kings agree.

Neptune, seeing the distressed Greeks, appears disguised as an old warrior, encourages Agamemnon, and gives a powerful shout that rallies the Greek spirit. Meanwhile, Juno, high on Olympus, sees Neptune aiding the Greeks and Jove on Mount Ida. To distract Jove, she decides to seduce him. She adorns herself beautifully, anointing herself with ambrosial oils, braiding her hair, donning a magnificent mantle, and glittering jewels. She then goes to Venus and, under false pretenses (claiming she needs to reconcile Ocean and Tethys), obtains Venus's magic girdle (cestus), which holds irresistible charms of love and desire.

Juno then flies to Lemnos to seek Sleep. She asks him to put Jove to sleep, offering Pasithaë, one of the Graces, as his wife. Sleep initially refuses, recalling Jove's wrath when he put him to sleep for Hercules, but with Juno's oath and the promise of Pasithaë, he agrees. Juno and Sleep go to Mount Ida, where Sleep hides disguised as a bird. Juno seduces Jove, who, overwhelmed by her charms, makes love to her. Jove falls into a deep sleep.

Sleep immediately flies to Neptune, informing him that Jove is asleep, giving Neptune free rein to aid the Greeks. Neptune, filled with zeal, rallies the Greeks, urging them to fight with strong resolve. The wounded kings, including Agamemnon, assist in reorganizing the troops.

The battle intensifies. Hector throws his spear at Ajax, but it is blocked. Ajax then hurls a massive stone at Hector, striking him in the chest and knocking him unconscious. Hector falls, his armor clanking. Polydamas, Agenor, and Æneas quickly shield Hector and carry him off the field, where his chariot takes him back towards Troy. With Hector removed, the Greeks fiercely attack. Ajax the Lesser kills Satnius. Polydamas kills Prothoënor. Ajax kills Archilochus. Acamas kills Promachus. Peneleus kills Ilioneus and holds up his severed head to taunt the Trojans. Meriones kills Hyperenor. Ajax the Lesser leads a furious pursuit of the retreating Trojans.

**Book XV: The Fifth Battle at the Ships; and the Acts of Ajax**
The Trojans are in full retreat. Jupiter awakens on Mount Ida and sees the Greek success, Hector wounded, and Neptune leading the Greeks. He is furious with Juno, accusing her of deception and reminding her of past punishments. Juno, trembling, denies responsibility and swears by Styx that Neptune acted on his own initiative.

Jupiter accepts her denial and reveals his unalterable plan: Juno must send Iris to command Neptune to withdraw from the battle, and Apollo to heal Hector and re-inspire the Trojans. Hector will then drive the Greeks back to their ships, Patroclus will be slain, Achilles will return to battle, and Hector will then die, leading to Troy's fall.

Juno flies to Olympus and, in the assembly of the gods, complains about Jove's tyrannical nature, inciting Mars. Mars, enraged by the death of his son Ascalaphus, prepares to fight, but Minerva restrains him, reminding him of Jove's power. Juno then sends Iris to Neptune and Apollo to Hector. Iris delivers Jove's command to Neptune, who, after expressing indignation at Jove's perceived arrogance, reluctantly withdraws from the battle and plunges into the sea.

Jove then sends Apollo to Hector. Apollo finds Hector still unconscious and revives him, filling him with strength and valor. Hector, revitalized, returns to battle, with Apollo leading him and bearing Jove's fearsome ægis. The Greeks are struck with terror and flee. Hector leads a new rampage, killing many Greeks. Apollo easily destroys the Greek wall and fills the trench, creating a clear path for the Trojans to the ships.

Nestor, in despair, prays to Jove to save the fleet. Jove responds with thunder, which the Trojans misinterpret as a sign of success. The Trojans, led by Hector, storm the Greek ships, attempting to set them on fire. Patroclus, still tending to Eurypylus, sees the imminent danger to the fleet and rushes to Achilles to urge him to fight. Ajax the Greater fights valiantly on the ships, killing Clytius, who attempted to light a ship on fire, and then Lycophron. Teucer aims an arrow at Hector, but Jove breaks his bowstring. Ajax tells Teucer to switch to a spear and shield. Hector encourages the Trojans, boasting of Jove's favor. Ajax rallies the Greeks, urging them to defend their last stand. The battle rages intensely at the ships. Hector reaches Protesilaus's ship, grasping its stern and calling for fire. Ajax makes a desperate stand, killing twelve Trojans who attempt to light the ships.

**Book XVI: The Sixth Battle, the Acts and Death of Patroclus**
Patroclus, weeping, approaches Achilles, recounting the severe Greek losses and the burning ships. He begs Achilles to fight or, failing that, to allow him to lead the Myrmidons into battle, clad in Achilles' armor, to frighten the Trojans and save the fleet. Achilles is moved and agrees, but gives a strict warning: Patroclus must only drive the Trojans from the ships and not pursue them to the city walls, as Hector is Achilles' destined foe. He expresses a fervent wish that all Greeks and Trojans might perish, leaving only him and Patroclus to take Troy.

Patroclus dons Achilles' armor (except for his Pelian ash spear). Automedon harnesses Achilles' immortal horses, Xanthus and Balius, along with the mortal Pedasus. Achilles rallies his Myrmidon forces, dividing them under five leaders. Achilles then pours a libation to Jove, praying for Patroclus's success in saving the ships and for his safe return. Jove grants the former but not the latter. Achilles then retires to his tent to watch.

Ajax, overwhelmed by the Trojan assault and the firebrands, is forced to retreat from the ships. Patroclus and the Myrmidons charge, and the Trojans, mistaking Patroclus for Achilles, are struck with panic and flee. Patroclus extinguishes the fires and drives the Trojans back. The Greeks rally and kill many Trojans. Patroclus kills Areilycus, Thoas, and Amphidus. Antilochus kills Atymnius and Maris. Peneleus kills Cleobulus and Lycon. Merion kills Neamas and Erymas.

Sarpedon, seeing his Lycian forces routed, reproaches them and challenges Patroclus. Jove, foreseeing his son Sarpedon's death, debates whether to save him, but Juno persuades him that fate must run its course. Jove, grieving, sends a shower of blood over the field. Patroclus and Sarpedon engage in single combat. Patroclus's spear kills Thrasymed. Sarpedon's spear misses Patroclus but kills Pedasus, one of Achilles' immortal horses. Automedon swiftly cuts the harness to free the remaining horses. Patroclus then throws his spear, piercing Sarpedon's heart and killing him. Sarpedon's dying words are an appeal to Glaucus to defend his body. Glaucus, wounded earlier, prays to Apollo for healing, which is granted, and he then rallies the Trojans and Hector to recover Sarpedon's body.

A fierce battle erupts over Sarpedon's body. Jove covers the field in darkness. Hector kills Epigeus, and Patroclus kills Sthenelaus. Glaucus kills Bathyclaeus, and Merion kills Laogonus. The Greeks eventually prevail, securing Sarpedon's body and Achilles' armor. Patroclus takes the armor as spoils. Jove commands Apollo to retrieve Sarpedon's body, cleanse it, anoint it, and have Sleep and Death transport it to Lycia for burial.

Patroclus, flush with victory and disregarding Achilles' warning, pursues the fleeing Trojans to the walls of Troy. Thrice he attempts to scale the walls, and thrice Apollo repulses him, warning him that Troy is not destined to fall by his hand. Apollo, disguised as Asius, encourages Hector to attack Patroclus. Hector, dismounted, confronts Patroclus. Patroclus kills Cebriones, Hector's charioteer, with a stone.

A battle ensues over Cebriones' body. Apollo, hidden in a cloud, strikes Patroclus from behind, causing his helmet to fall, his spear to break, his shield to drop, and his armor to loosen. Euphorbus, a Dardan youth, then wounds Patroclus in the back with a spear and retreats. Hector, seeing Patroclus disarmed and wounded, rushes in and stabs him with his lance, delivering a mortal blow. Hector boasts over the dying Patroclus. Patroclus, with his dying breath, prophesies Hector's imminent death at Achilles' hands. Hector then pulls his spear from Patroclus's body and, after a brief chase, strips Achilles' armor from the dead Patroclus.

**Book XVII: The Seventh Battle, for the Body of Patroclus.—The Acts of Menelaus**
Upon Patroclus's death, Menelaus immediately springs to defend his body from the Trojans. Euphorbus, who wounded Patroclus, challenges Menelaus for the spoils. Menelaus scorns his boast and kills Euphorbus with a spear to the throat, stripping his armor. Apollo, disguised as Mentes, advises Hector to abandon his pursuit of Achilles' horses and instead challenge Menelaus for Patroclus's body.

Hector, seeing Euphorbus dead and Menelaus with his armor, charges. Menelaus, seeing Hector and his forces, reluctantly retreats and calls for Ajax. Ajax arrives and covers Patroclus's body with his great shield. Hector, seeing Ajax, retreats with Achilles' armor (which he had taken from Patroclus).

Glaucus fiercely reproaches Hector for his cowardice and for abandoning Sarpedon's body, threatening that the Lycians will no longer fight for Troy if he continues to show such weakness. He urges Hector to fight for Patroclus's body to exchange it for Sarpedon's. Hector, stung by the rebuke, denies cowardice and declares he will prove his valor. He puts on Achilles' armor, promising equal honors and spoils to any Trojan who helps him claim Patroclus's body. Jove, seeing Hector in Achilles' divine armor, pities Hector's destined short life but grants him strength for one more day of glory.

The battle for Patroclus's body intensifies. Hector, imbued with divine strength, rallies the Trojans. Ajax rallies the Greeks. Hippothous attempts to drag Patroclus's body away by his ankles but is killed by Ajax. Schedius and Phorcys are also killed. Apollo, disguised as Periphas, inspires Æneas to rally the Trojans. Æneas charges, killing Leocritus. Lycomedes kills Apisaon.

Jove shrouds the battle around Patroclus's body in darkness, while the rest of the field is in sunshine. Achilles' immortal horses, Xanthus and Balius, stand weeping over Patroclus's death, inconsolable despite Automedon's efforts. Jove pities them and grants them renewed spirit. Automedon asks Alcimedon to drive the chariot while he fights on foot. Hector and Æneas charge to seize Achilles' chariot. Automedon fights bravely, killing Aretus. The Ajaxes intervene, and Hector and Æneas are driven back.

Minerva, sent by Jove, inspires Menelaus, who kills Podes, a friend of Hector. Apollo, disguised as Phaenops, informs Hector of Podes' death, spurring Hector to attack Menelaus. Jove shakes his ægis, spreading fear among the Greeks. Peneleus and Leitus are wounded. Idomeneus throws a spear at Hector, which breaks. Hector kills Coeranus, Meriones' charioteer. Meriones and Idomeneus retreat.

Ajax, seeing the Greek's dire situation and the darkness Jove has cast, prays to Jove to dispel the cloud, wishing to die in daylight if it is their fate. Jove grants light. Ajax then tells Menelaus to find Antilochus and send him to Achilles with the news of Patroclus's death. Menelaus and Meriones then lift Patroclus's body, while the two Ajaxes cover their retreat, fighting fiercely. Antilochus, weeping, runs to Achilles to deliver the devastating news. The Trojans furiously pursue the Greeks carrying Patroclus's body, but the Ajaxes bravely defend the rear, allowing the body to be borne to the ships.

**Book XVIII: The Grief of Achilles, and New Armour Made Him by Vulcan**
Achilles, seated by his ship, feels a grim foreboding of Patroclus's death. Antilochus arrives, weeping, and confirms the terrible news: Patroclus is dead, and Hector has stripped him of Achilles' armor. Achilles is overcome with profound grief, spreading ashes on his head, tearing his hair, and groveling in the dust. The captive women lament with him. Antilochus holds him to prevent self-harm.

Thetis, from her deep-sea cave, hears Achilles' cries. She and her Nereid sisters rise to comfort him. Thetis laments her son's short, sorrowful life and his inevitable death. Achilles declares he has no desire to live unless he can kill Hector and avenge Patroclus, accepting his own impending death. Thetis promises to bring him new, divine armor forged by Vulcan by dawn. She then dismisses her Nereids and ascends to Olympus.

Meanwhile, the Greeks are still struggling to recover Patroclus's body from the furious Trojans. Hector, like a flame, rages over the field. Juno, seeing the Greeks in distress, sends Iris to Achilles (without Jove's knowledge) to urge him to show himself at the trench. Achilles explains he is unarmed. Iris tells him to simply appear, as his presence alone will terrify the Trojans. Achilles rises. Pallas throws her ægis over his shoulders and crowns his head with a golden cloud, from which fire blazes. Achilles shouts from the trench, and Minerva amplifies his voice. The Trojans are struck with terror, their horses recoil, and many are crushed. The Greeks seize the opportunity and finally retrieve Patroclus's body. Achilles then mourns over his dead friend.

Juno commands the sun to set, ending the battle and bringing relief to the weary Greeks. The frightened Trojans hold a council. Polydamas advises retreating inside the city walls, fearing Achilles' return. Hector furiously rejects this, insisting they stay on the plain to face Achilles at dawn and boasting of his own readiness. Pallas influences the Trojans to applaud Hector's bad advice.

Achilles continues to mourn Patroclus through the night, embracing his body and vowing to avenge him by killing Hector and sacrificing twelve Trojan youths on his pyre. He orders his men to wash and prepare Patroclus's body. Thetis arrives at Vulcan's forge on Olympus. Vulcan expresses gratitude to Thetis for past kindness and promises to forge magnificent new armor for Achilles.

Vulcan creates an immense, elaborately decorated shield. Its surface depicts: the cosmos (earth, heaven, sun, moon, stars); two cities, one in peace (weddings, feasts, justice) and one in war (siege, ambush, battle); a ploughed field; a king's harvest; a vineyard; a herd of cattle attacked by lions; a flock of sheep; and a dancing floor. He also forges a cuirass, greaves, and a helmet. Thetis takes the blazing armor and flies back to Achilles.

**Book XIX: The Reconciliation of Achilles and Agamemnon**
At dawn, Thetis brings the new, divine armor from Vulcan to Achilles, finding him still weeping over Patroclus's body. The armor blazes with fire, filling Achilles with rage and desire for battle. Achilles expresses concern that Patroclus's body will decay, but Thetis reassures him, pouring nectar and ambrosia into the corpse to preserve it from corruption.

Achilles, obeying his mother, calls the Greeks to assembly. He publicly declares an end to his quarrel with Agamemnon, stating that their strife has caused too much suffering, and he is eager to fight. Agamemnon accepts Achilles' renunciation, blaming Jove, Fate, and the goddess Ate for his past actions. He repeats his offer of gifts and solemnly swears an oath that he never touched Briseïs.

Achilles dismisses the gifts, eager for immediate battle. Ulysses, however, advises that the army first eat and rest to restore their strength for the coming combat. He insists that Agamemnon formally present the gifts and swear his oath in public, to set a good example. Agamemnon agrees to all of Ulysses's suggestions.

Ulysses and other chiefs bring the gifts from Agamemnon's tent to Achilles' tent. Agamemnon, holding a boar for sacrifice, publicly swears his oath. The boar is then thrown into the sea. The Greeks are urged to eat, but Achilles, consumed by grief, refuses all food, vowing not to eat until he has avenged Patroclus. Jove, seeing Achilles' fasting, sends Minerva to infuse ambrosia and nectar into his breast, strengthening him without food.

Achilles then arms himself in his new, blazing armor, his eyes burning with fury. He addresses his immortal horses, Xanthus and Balius, reproaching them for leaving Patroclus to die and urging them not to abandon him. Xanthus, miraculously given a voice by Juno, warns Achilles that he will die soon, not by their fault but by divine decree. The Furies silence the horse. Achilles, undaunted, accepts his fate and rushes to battle, declaring that Troy shall perish.

**Book XX: The Battle of the Gods, and the Acts of Achilles**
As Achilles prepares for battle, Jupiter calls a council of the gods on Olympus. He grants permission for all deities to assist either the Greeks or the Trojans, fearing that Achilles, unopposed, will take Troy against its fated time. The gods descend to the battlefield. The earth, sea, and Olympus shake from their clash. Pluto, in the underworld, trembles lest the earth open and reveal his realms.

The gods divide: Juno, Neptune, Minerva, Hermes, and Vulcan align with the Greeks; Latona, Apollo, Mars, Diana, and the river god Xanthus (Scamander) with the Trojans. Achilles, glowing with rage, seeks only Hector. Apollo, disguised as Lycaon, encourages Æneas to confront Achilles, reminding him of his divine lineage from Venus. Æneas, initially hesitant due to past defeats, is emboldened.

Juno, seeing Æneas advance, gathers the Greek-aiding gods, fearing Æneas's death might go against fate, as he is destined to found a new Dardan line. Neptune suggests they observe unless gods directly interfere. Æneas and Achilles meet and exchange fierce boasts about their lineages. Æneas throws his spear, striking Achilles' shield but failing to pierce it. Achilles throws his spear, piercing Æneas's shield and grazing him. As Achilles draws his sword for the kill, Neptune, unseen, saves Æneas by shrouding Achilles in darkness, removing his spear from Æneas's shield, and transporting Æneas to the rear of the battle, warning him to avoid Achilles until Achilles' fated death.

Achilles is astonished to find Æneas gone and his spear returned, realizing a god intervened. He then unleashes his boundless fury on the rest of the Trojan forces, slaughtering many, including Iphytion, Demoleon, Hippodamas, Laoganus, Dardanus, Alastor, Mulius, Echeclus, Deucalion, Rhigmas, and his charioteer.

Hector, seeing his youngest brother Polydore slain by Achilles, confronts Achilles despite Apollo's earlier warning. They exchange threats. Achilles throws his spear at Hector, but Pallas deflects it. As Achilles charges with his sword, Apollo snatches Hector away in a cloud. Achilles, enraged by Hector's escape, vows to kill him eventually and continues his slaughter of the remaining Trojans, driving them towards the city and the river Scamander.

**Book XXI: The Battle in the River Scamander**
The Trojans, fleeing Achilles, divide into two groups: some rush towards the city, shrouded in a mist by Juno to aid their escape, while others plunge into the river Xanthus (Scamander). Achilles, abandoning his spear, plunges into the river with his sword, massacring Trojans and causing the river to run red with blood. He takes twelve young Trojan men alive, destined for sacrifice to Patroclus's shade.

Achilles then encounters Lycaon, a son of Priam whom he had previously captured and sold into slavery. Lycaon, having recently returned, desperately begs for his life. Achilles, hardened by Patroclus's death, mercilessly refuses, stating that all Trojans must die to atone for his friend. He kills Lycaon and casts his body into the river, mocking him.

Achilles then confronts Asteropeus, a Paeonian chief and son of the river god Axius. Asteropeus bravely throws two spears, one grazing Achilles' arm. Achilles then kills Asteropeus with his sword, boasting of his superior divine lineage. He casts Asteropeus's body into the river and continues slaughtering more Paeonians.

The river god Scamander, choked with bodies, speaks to Achilles, asking him to cease the slaughter in his waters. Achilles agrees to stop killing in the river but vows to continue until Troy falls or Hector is slain. Enraged, Scamander raises huge waves, disgorges dead bodies, and attempts to drown Achilles. Achilles struggles, grasping an elm tree, which uproots, allowing him to escape the flood. Scamander and Simois then join forces, pursuing Achilles across the plain. Achilles, struggling, prays to Jove for help.

Neptune and Pallas appear to Achilles in human form, reassuring him that he is protected and destined to kill Hector. Juno, seeing Scamander's rage, calls upon Vulcan to set the river on fire. Vulcan unleashes vast flames, consuming the dead, drying the land, and boiling the river, trees, and creatures within it. Scamander, in agony, pleads with Vulcan and then Juno to stop the fire, promising to cease aiding Troy. Juno commands Vulcan to stop, and the fire subsides, the river returning to its course.

The other gods then engage in battle: Mars attacks Minerva but is struck down by her with a huge stone. Venus attempts to rescue Mars, but Minerva strikes Venus too, and they fall. Neptune challenges Apollo, but Apollo refuses to fight mortals. Diana reproaches Apollo for his cowardice, but Juno seizes Diana, disarms her, and beats her with her own bow. Hermes refuses to fight Latona. The gods then return to Olympus.

Achilles, now unopposed by gods, resumes his slaughter, driving the remaining Trojans towards the city gates. Apollo inspires Agenor to confront Achilles. Agenor, after a moment of internal debate, decides to stand and fight. He throws his spear at Achilles, striking his shin but failing to pierce the divine armor. As Achilles prepares to kill Agenor, Apollo shrouds Agenor in a cloud and carries him away. Apollo then assumes Agenor's form and leads Achilles on a long chase away from the city walls, allowing the remaining Trojans to retreat safely into Troy. The Trojans, relieved, shut the city gates.

**Book XXII: The Death of Hector**
The Trojans, smitten with panic, rush inside their city walls, leaving Hector alone outside the Scaean Gate, determined to face Achilles. Apollo, who had been leading Achilles on a chase, reveals himself and mocks Achilles for pursuing a god. Achilles, enraged, denounces Apollo for deceiving him and costing him more Trojan lives, and then rushes towards the city.

Priam, from the city walls, sees Achilles approaching and Hector standing alone. He tearfully pleads with Hector to come inside, fearing his imminent death and lamenting the loss of his other sons. Hecuba also appeals to Hector, exposing her breast to him and reminding him of his infancy. Hector, weighing his options, regrets rejecting Polydamas's earlier advice to retreat. He considers negotiating with Achilles but dismisses the thought, resolving to fight heroically.

As Achilles approaches, radiating terror in his divine armor, Hector's resolve breaks, and he flees in panic. Achilles pursues him three times around the walls of Troy. The gods observe from Olympus. Jove laments Hector's fate and asks if they should save him, but Minerva objects, reminding Jove that Hector is fated to die. Jove assents. Minerva descends, disguised as Deiphobus (Hector's brother), and urges Hector to stand and fight alongside her. Hector, believing he has an ally, agrees.

Hector proposes an oath that the victor will return the loser's body for burial. Achilles furiously rejects any pact, vowing eternal hate and vengeance for Patroclus. Achilles throws his spear, which Hector dodges. Minerva retrieves the spear and returns it to Achilles, unseen by Hector. Hector, thinking he has missed, throws his spear, which is repelled by Achilles' divine shield. Hector then realizes he has been deceived by a god, that Deiphobus is not there, and that his death is near.

Hector draws his sword and charges Achilles, determined to die gloriously. Achilles, knowing the weakness in Patroclus's old armor (which Hector is wearing), drives his spear through Hector's neck, avoiding the windpipe. Achilles boasts over the dying Hector, refusing his plea for burial and declaring his body will be eaten by dogs. Hector, with his last breath, prophesies Achilles' own death at the Scaean Gate by Paris and Apollo. Hector dies.

Achilles pulls out his spear and strips Hector's armor. Other Greeks wound Hector's body. Achilles, in a final act of vengeance, pierces Hector's ankles, ties them with thongs to his chariot, and drags his body around Patroclus's tomb in full view of Priam and Hecuba on the walls. Priam and Hecuba wail in anguish. Priam, distraught, tries to rush out but is restrained.

Andromache, unaware, is weaving inside the palace. Hearing the wailing from the walls, she rushes out. From the walls, she sees Hector's body being dragged. She faints in horror. When revived, she laments Hector's death, the bleak future of their son Astyanax as an orphan and slave, and the inevitable fall of Troy.

**Book XXIII: Funeral Games in Honour of Patroclus**
The Greeks return to their ships, mourning Patroclus. Achilles leads his Myrmidons in three circuits around Patroclus's body with their chariots, lamenting. He places Hector's body face down before the bier. The Myrmidons then share a funeral feast. Achilles refuses to cleanse himself or eat until Patroclus is buried. He requests Agamemnon to prepare a funeral pyre.

Achilles, exhausted, falls asleep on the shore. The ghost of Patroclus appears to him, urging him to bury his body so his soul can find rest and asking for their bones to be buried together. Achilles attempts to embrace the ghost, but it vanishes, leaving him astonished.

At dawn, Agamemnon dispatches a band with mules and axes to Mount Ida to fell timber for the pyre. The timber is brought back, and a large pyre is built. The Myrmidons, armed and in chariots, lead a solemn procession. Patroclus's body is carried on a bier, followed by Achilles, who supports his friend's head. Achilles cuts a lock of his hair, dedicated to the river Sperchius, and places it on Patroclus's body, regretting his broken vow to return home.

Patroclus's body is laid on the pyre, covered with fat, and surrounded by sacrificed oxen, sheep, jars of honey, and oil. Four horses and two dogs are also sacrificed. In a horrific act, Achilles then sacrifices twelve Trojan captives on the pyre. Achilles invokes Patroclus's ghost, promising Hector's body to the dogs. However, Venus and Apollo protect Hector's body from further mutilation and decay. The pyre does not ignite until Achilles prays to the North and West Winds. Iris, sent by Achilles' prayer, fetches the Winds, who rush forth and ignite the pyre, which burns all night. Achilles watches, lamenting, until dawn.

At dawn, the flames subside. Achilles and the chiefs extinguish the embers with wine, collect Patroclus's bones, place them in a golden urn, and build a large mound of earth as his tomb.

Achilles then announces funeral games with prizes:
1.  **Chariot Race:** Prizes include a woman, a tripod, a mare, a cauldron, and a double bowl. Eumelus, Diomed, Menelaus, Antilochus, and Meriones compete. Nestor advises his son Antilochus on strategy. During the race, Apollo strikes Diomed's whip, but Pallas restores it and breaks Eumelus's chariot. Diomed wins first. Antilochus uses cunning to pass Menelaus for second. Achilles resolves a dispute about the prizes, awards Diomed first, placates Eumelus with a cuirass, and gives Nestor a double bowl as an honorary gift. Menelaus accepts Antilochus's apology.
2.  **Boxing:** Prizes are a mule and a goblet. Epeus defeats Euryalus with a single powerful blow.
3.  **Wrestling:** Prizes are a tripod and a female captive. Ajax Telamon and Ulysses wrestle to a draw, and Achilles awards them equal prizes.
4.  **Foot-Race:** Prizes are a silver urn, an ox, and half a talent of gold. Oïlean Ajax, Ulysses, and Antilochus compete. Pallas trips Ajax, allowing Ulysses to win first. Ajax laments divine interference. Antilochus takes third.
5.  **Single Combat (Spear Fight):** Prizes are Sarpedon's armor and a Thracian sword. Diomed and Ajax Telamon engage. The Greeks stop the fight, declaring both worthy. Diomed is awarded Sarpedon's armor and the Thracian sword.
6.  **Discus Throw:** Prize is a mass of iron. Polypoetes throws farthest, winning.
7.  **Archery:** Prizes are double-edged and single-edged axes for hitting a dove or cutting its cord. Teucer cuts the cord. Merion, praying to Apollo, hits the dove and wins.
8.  **Javelin Throw:** Prizes are a massy spear and an ornate charger. Achilles, honoring Agamemnon's status, awards him the charger, giving Merion the spear.

**Book XXIV: The Redemption of the Body of Hector**
After the funeral games for Patroclus, Achilles continues to mourn. For twelve days, he repeatedly drags Hector's body around Patroclus's tomb each morning. Apollo protects Hector's body from mutilation and decay. The gods pity Hector and discuss the situation. Apollo speaks to the assembled gods, criticizing Achilles' savage behavior and defending Hector's piety. Juno fiercely counters, emphasizing Achilles' divine lineage and her enduring hatred for Troy.

Jupiter decrees that Hector's body must be ransomed. He sends Iris to Thetis, commanding her to tell Achilles to return Hector's body for ransom, warning of divine wrath if he refuses. Thetis delivers the message to Achilles, who agrees to obey Jove's will.

Jove then sends Iris to Priam, commanding him to go alone to Achilles' tent with rich gifts to ransom Hector's body, promising divine protection. Iris delivers the message to Priam, who is resolved to go despite his wife Hecuba's tearful pleas and fears for his safety. Priam prepares the ransom gifts. Hecuba, still trying to dissuade him, offers a libation to Jove, and Jove sends an eagle as a favorable omen.

Encouraged, Priam sets forth in his chariot, with the herald Idæus driving a wagon laden with gifts. Jove, pitying Priam, sends Hermes, disguised as a young Myrmidon, to guide and protect him. Hermes meets Priam and Idæus at a spring, reassures them, and, still disguised, tells Priam that Hector's body is preserved and protected by the gods. Priam offers Hermes a golden goblet, but Hermes refuses.

Hermes then takes the reins, puts the Greek guards to sleep with his wand, opens the gates, and leads Priam and the wagon safely through the Greek camp to Achilles' tent. Hermes reveals his divine identity to Priam and advises him to supplicate Achilles by appealing to his father, son, and mother. Hermes then departs.

Priam enters Achilles' tent, prostrates himself, embraces Achilles' knees, and kisses the hands that killed his son. He appeals to Achilles' pity by reminding him of his own aged father, Peleus, and offers the ransom. Achilles is deeply moved by the sight, remembering his own father and Patroclus. Both men weep. Achilles raises Priam, offers words of comfort, speaking of human sorrow and Jove's two urns of good and evil. He urges Priam to endure his fate.

Priam, still focused on his mission, asks for Hector's body. Achilles, angered by Priam's impatience, warns him not to provoke him, stating that he intended to return Hector's body as Jove commanded. Achilles orders his handmaids to wash and anoint Hector's body out of Priam's sight. Hector's body is then placed on the wagon. Achilles, lamenting to Patroclus's shade, ensures the gifts will go to Patroclus's shrine.

Achilles invites Priam to a meal. He serves Priam himself. Priam requests a twelve-day truce for Hector's funeral rites, which Achilles grants. Priam and Idæus then rest in the porch, while Achilles sleeps with Briseïs. Hermes awakens Priam, warning him to leave before the Greeks discover him. Hermes guides them safely out of the Greek camp.

At dawn, Priam and Idæus return to Troy. Cassandra sees the procession from the walls and alerts the city. The entire city rushes out to meet the wagon, wailing in grief. Priam orders them to take the body to the palace before mourning fully. At the palace, Andromache, Hecuba, and Helen lament over Hector's body. Andromache expresses her sorrow and fears for their son Astyanax. Hecuba praises Hector and notes the divine preservation of his body. Helen mourns Hector as her only kind friend in Troy. Priam then orders the Trojans to gather wood for nine days. On the tenth day, Hector's body is burned on a pyre. His bones are collected in a golden urn and buried under a mound of earth. The Trojans then share a final funeral feast. The narrative concludes that such were the honors paid to Hector, and his shade now rests in peace."
The Scarlet Letter-Nathaniel Hawthorne,"The provided text, titled ""The Scarlet Letter,"" begins with an extensive introductory section, ""The Custom-House,"" before presenting the main narrative.

**The Custom-House: An Introduction**

The narrator, a former surveyor for the Custom-House in his native town of Salem, describes the dilapidated brick edifice, a shadow of its former commercial glory. He recounts his experience serving in this federal post, which he held for three and a half hours each forenoon. His colleagues were primarily elderly Custom-House officers, mostly retired sea-captains, whom he found largely inefficient but harmless. He recounts ""abbreviating the official breath"" of some, allowing them to retire.

He describes a remarkable figure, the permanent Inspector, a man of about eighty. This Inspector is portrayed as incredibly robust and physically healthy, though possessing moderate intellect and minimal moral or spiritual depth. He is presented as the ideal Custom-House officer due to his immunity to moral detriment. Another figure is the Collector, a gallant old General and distinguished military veteran, now frail and mostly confined to a chair, dimly observing the office bustle. The narrator also praises a sharp, efficient ""man of business"" who flawlessly handles the office's intricacies.

The narrator reflects on how his Custom-House life stifled his literary imagination, which had flourished previously among intellectual friends like Emerson and Thoreau. He felt his literary faculties were suspended, finding the custom-house atmosphere unsuitable for creative work. He considered his appointment a ""transitory life"" and his ""doom.""

A significant event in his third year as Surveyor was the election of General Taylor, bringing a hostile administration into power. As a Democrat, the narrator was subsequently dismissed from his post. Though initially an ""unpleasant predicament,"" this ""unkindly shove"" ultimately freed him to return to his writing, which he now metaphorically calls his ""POSTHUMOUS PAPERS OF A DECAPITATED SURVEYOR.""

During his tenure, on an ""idle and rainy day,"" he made a discovery in an unfinished room of the Custom-House filled with old documents. He found a small package wrapped in ancient yellow parchment, which turned out to be a commission for a past Surveyor of Customs, Jonathan Pue. Within this package, he discovered a small roll of paper containing ""many particulars respecting the life and conversation of one Hester Prynne,"" a noteworthy personage from the period between early Massachusetts and the late seventeenth century. He also found a physical relic: ""a certain affair of fine red cloth, much worn and faded,"" with traces of gold embroidery. This fabric, on examination, ""assumed the shape of a letter. It was the capital letter A."" When he instinctively placed this scarlet letter on his own breast, he experienced a sensation of ""burning heat,"" as if it were red-hot iron.

The narrator states that Mr. Pue's manuscript provided the ""main facts"" for the story he is now about to tell, ""THE SCARLET LETTER."" He felt exhorted by the ghost of Mr. Pue to bring this narrative to the public, admitting he has taken creative license with the emotional and psychological aspects while maintaining the authenticity of the outline. He concludes his introduction by noting the death of the old Inspector (killed by a horse) and his own growing detachment from Salem, feeling he needs to pursue his literary calling elsewhere.

**The Scarlet Letter: The Plot**

**I. The Prison-Door**
In a new colony, a gloomy, weather-stained wooden prison stands, a symbol of early societal severity. A thorny wild rose-bush, growing by the prison door, offers delicate beauty, perhaps as a symbol of nature's pity.

**II. The Market-Place**
On a summer morning, a stern crowd of Boston's Puritan inhabitants gathers before the prison door. Women in the crowd discuss the expected punishment of Hester Prynne, suggesting harsher measures than what the magistrates typically mete out for ""malefactresses."" The prison door opens, and Hester Prynne emerges, holding her three-month-old infant, who blinks in the bright daylight, accustomed to the prison's gloom. Hester is a tall, beautiful young woman, who steps forth with an air of natural dignity. On the breast of her elaborate and splendid gown, embroidered with gold thread on fine red cloth, is the letter ""A."" Her defiant appearance, despite her public shame, astonishes the onlookers. The town-beadle leads Hester through the crowd to a scaffold in the market-place, where she is sentenced to stand for three hours as a public spectacle. As she endures the unrelenting stares, Hester's mind races through memories of her past in Old England: her family home, her parents, her own maiden beauty, and finally, the pale, scholar-like, slightly deformed man she married, with whom she lived in a Continental city. She then returns to the present reality, clutching her baby and touching the scarlet letter, confirming its painful truth.

**III. The Recognition**
Hester's intense focus on the crowd is broken by the sight of a white man standing with an Indian. This white man, small in stature and slightly deformed with one shoulder higher than the other, catches Hester's eye. His face, initially composed, twists in ""writhing horror"" as he recognizes her, then he quickly controls his expression and subtly gestures for her silence. He asks a townsman about Hester, identifying himself as a stranger who has been a captive among ""heathen-folk"" and is now brought by the Indian for ransom. The townsman explains Hester is Mistress Prynne, whose husband, Master Prynne, sent her ahead to Boston two years prior but has not been heard from since. The stranger deduces Hester's ""evil doings"" and the existence of the child, then learns of her sentence to wear the scarlet letter for life because she refuses to name the child's father. The stranger remarks, ""A wise sentence! ... He will be known!—he will be known!—he will be known!""

From a balcony above the scaffold, Governor Bellingham, Reverend Mr. Wilson, and Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale observe. Mr. Wilson urges Dimmesdale, Hester's pastor, to compel her to name the father. Dimmesdale, a young, pale, nervous, but eloquent clergyman, earnestly exhorts Hester to confess for her soul's peace and his own, implying the father's hypocrisy. Hester steadfastly refuses, stating the letter is ""too deeply branded"" and she wishes she could endure ""his agony"" as well as her own. A voice from the crowd, which Hester recognizes, demands she ""give your child a father!"" Hester, turning pale, again refuses, declaring her child will seek a ""heavenly Father."" Dimmesdale, ""Wondrous strength and generosity of a woman’s heart! She will not speak!"" Mr. Wilson then delivers a long sermon on sin, focusing on the scarlet letter's terrors. Hester endures with stony insensibility, and her infant cries. Hester is led back to prison, the scarlet letter reportedly gleaming luridly in the dark passage.

**IV. The Interview**
In prison, Hester is agitated, threatening harm to herself or her baby. The jailer brings in Roger Chillingworth, the physician introduced earlier, who is skilled in both European and native herbal medicine. Chillingworth gives a calming draught to the convulsing baby, then one to Hester. Hester recognizes him as her long-lost husband, who she feared might seek revenge. Chillingworth confirms his intention is not to kill but to prolong her suffering, saying, ""Live, therefore, and bear about thy doom with thee,"" touching the scarlet letter, which seems to scorch her.

Chillingworth admits his own folly in marrying her, a young and beautiful woman, when he was already ""in decay"" and ""misshapen."" Hester admits she felt no love for him. He acknowledges their mutual wrong but states that the ""man lives who has wronged us both!"" He demands to know the father's identity. Hester firmly refuses. Chillingworth vows to uncover the secret, saying he will ""read it on his heart"" and that ""Sooner or later, he must needs be mine!"" He promises not to reveal the father to human law or seek his death, but rather to ensure he lives, tormented by Chillingworth's presence. He forces Hester to swear an oath to keep his identity as her husband a secret, threatening to destroy the father's ""fame, his position, his life"" if she breaks it. Hester, appalled but bound by the oath, agrees. Chillingworth departs with an ominous smile, leaving Hester to wonder if he is the ""Black Man"" and if she has sold her soul.

**V. Hester at her Needle**
Released from prison, Hester chooses to remain in Boston, feeling an irresistible ""fatality"" to stay near the father of her child. She settles in an isolated cottage on the town's outskirts. She supports herself and Pearl through her exquisite needlework, which becomes highly sought after for official garments and funerals, but never for bridal veils, symbolizing society's continued condemnation of her sin. Hester lives ascetically, dressing simply, but adorns Pearl in magnificent, fanciful garments, often crimson and gold, which uncannily echo the scarlet letter.

Hester gives her excess earnings to charity, often receiving insults in return. Over seven years, the public's perception of Hester softens due to her quiet endurance, charity, and helpfulness during calamities. The scarlet letter, once a mark of infamy, begins to be reinterpreted by some as ""Able,"" recognizing her strength. However, Hester's own character has been transformed into a ""marble coldness,"" her tender qualities withered by suffering. She develops a ""freedom of speculation,"" exploring radical thoughts outside Puritan dogma, but her primary focus becomes Pearl's education. She sometimes feels the scarlet letter has endowed her with a ""new sense,"" a sympathetic awareness of hidden sin in others. Rumors spread that her scarlet letter glows with infernal fire at night.

**VI. Pearl**
Pearl, now a child, is described as a beautiful, intelligent, but untamable and ""disordered"" being, reflecting Hester's passionate state during her conception. Hester finds it impossible to discipline Pearl, who seems more like an ""airy sprite"" than a human child, often displaying a ""perverse merriment"" or ""malicious"" look. Pearl is an outcast among other Puritan children, who scorn her, and she responds with fierce, wild tantrums. Her existence is a constant torment for Hester, yet she is also Hester's ""only treasure.""

Pearl's first conscious awareness was of the scarlet letter on Hester's bosom, often touching it and smiling, causing Hester immense pain. One day, playing, Pearl throws wildflowers at the letter. She then crafts a green ""A"" from seaweed and places it on her own breast. Pearl asks Hester what her letter means, then asks, ""It is for the same reason that the minister keeps his hand over his heart!"" Hester is startled by her acute observation. Pearl presses for the truth, but Hester, after contemplating revealing her secret to her child, deflects, saying the letter is for its gold-thread. Pearl continues to tease her mother about the letter and the minister's hand, prompting Hester's rare display of anger. Hester remembers the townspeople's belief that Pearl is a ""demon offspring.""

**VII. The Governor’s Hall**
Hester visits Governor Bellingham's mansion, ostensibly to deliver embroidered gloves, but primarily to defend her right to keep Pearl, as some prominent citizens plan to take the child, citing her ""demon origin"" or need for better guardianship. Pearl, dressed in crimson and gold, like a ""living hieroglyphic"" of the scarlet letter, accompanies her. Children mock them as they enter town, but Pearl fiercely puts them to flight.

At the Governor's house, Pearl is fascinated by a gleaming suit of armor. In its convex breastplate, Hester sees her scarlet letter magnified, seeming to hide her entirely, and Pearl points at this reflection with an impish smile.

**VIII. The Elf-Child and the Minister**
Governor Bellingham, Mr. Wilson, Mr. Dimmesdale, and Roger Chillingworth (now Dimmesdale's physician) are present. Bellingham and Wilson question Pearl's strange appearance and her religious upbringing. Pearl cryptically says she is ""mother’s child"" and was ""plucked... off the bush of wild roses that grew by the prison-door."" Chillingworth whispers to Dimmesdale, and Hester notices the dark, misshapen change in Chillingworth's features.

Bellingham is shocked by Pearl's answer and, concerned for her soul, suggests taking her from Hester. Hester passionately appeals to Mr. Dimmesdale, urging him to speak for her, saying Pearl is both her ""happiness"" and ""torture,"" keeping her alive and punishing her, and is the ""scarlet letter, only capable of being loved."" Dimmesdale, pale and agitated, argues that God gave Pearl to Hester as both a blessing and a retribution, to keep her mother from deeper sin, and that Pearl, if raised to heaven, will bring her parent thither. He convinces them to leave Pearl with Hester, provided she receives catechism instruction. Pearl, in a rare tender moment, takes Dimmesdale's hand and receives a kiss on her brow. Mistress Hibbins, the Governor's witch-sister, appears, hinting at Hester and Dimmesdale's secret connection to the ""Black Man"" in the forest, and implies Pearl's escape from Satan's snare by remaining with Hester.

**IX. The Leech**
Roger Chillingworth, Hester's concealed husband, takes up residence as a physician, becoming Mr. Dimmesdale's medical advisor. Dimmesdale's health is rapidly declining, marked by paleness, a tremulous voice, and a habit of clutching his hand to his heart. The community sees Chillingworth's arrival as providential for their beloved minister. Chillingworth moves into the same house as Dimmesdale. However, the townspeople soon begin to view Chillingworth's aspect as ""ugly and evil,"" suspecting him to be Satan's emissary, burrowing into Dimmesdale's intimacy to plot against his soul.

**X. The Leech and His Patient**
Chillingworth, once an upright man, is now consumed by a ""terrible fascination"" for revenge, digging into Dimmesdale's heart like a miner for gold. Dimmesdale, due to his own morbidness, is vaguely aware of an ""inimical"" presence but cannot recognize Chillingworth as his enemy. Chillingworth finds herbs on an unmarked grave, which he suggests symbolize a hidden, unconfessed secret. Dimmesdale argues that secrets are held until the Day of Judgment, when they will be joyfully revealed. Chillingworth counters that some men deceive themselves by hiding their sins.

Pearl and Hester pass by the window. Pearl, in a perverse mood, dances on a tombstone and places prickly burrs on Hester's scarlet letter. Pearl throws a burr at Dimmesdale, who shrinks away, prompting Pearl to clap in ecstasy and declare, ""yonder old Black Man will catch you! He hath got hold of the minister already."" Chillingworth, observing Pearl's wildness, questions if she has any ""principle of being"" other than ""the freedom of a broken law."" Chillingworth again presses Dimmesdale to reveal the ""wound or trouble in your soul,"" but Dimmesdale passionately refuses to confess to an ""earthly physician,"" committing himself to God. He rushes from the room. Chillingworth, with a grave smile, understands the implication, muttering Dimmesdale ""hath done a wild thing erenow, this pious Master Dimmesdale, in the hot passion of his heart!""

Their intimacy is re-established. Some time later, Dimmesdale falls into a deep sleep. Chillingworth enters his room, moves his vestment, and discovers a secret on Dimmesdale's bosom. Chillingworth reacts with a ""wild look of wonder, joy, and horror!"" and ""ghastly rapture,"" throwing up his arms and stamping his foot, as if Satan had just claimed a soul.

**XI. The Interior of a Heart**
After his discovery, Chillingworth's malice is no longer latent. His aim is to become Dimmesdale's trusted confidant, the pitiless recipient of all his secret agony, playing upon his conscience. Dimmesdale, though having a ""dim perception of some evil influence,"" never grasps Chillingworth's true nature, mistaking his abhorrence for his own ""morbid spot.""

Despite his inner torment, Dimmesdale's suffering elevates his eloquence, making him a greatly revered minister. He is tortured by this public veneration, longing to confess his vileness from the pulpit. He repeatedly attempts to confess his deep sin, but his vague words are always interpreted as humility, only increasing the people's reverence. He resorts to secret self-punishment: scourging himself, fasting, and holding vigils, during which he experiences spectral visions, including Hester and Pearl pointing to his breast. He feels his only truth is the ""anguish in his inmost soul.""

**XII. The Minister’s Vigil**
One night, Dimmesdale, in a somnambulistic state, goes to the scaffold where Hester once stood. He gives a loud shriek, imagining the universe seeing a ""scarlet token on his naked breast."" Governor Bellingham and Mistress Hibbins hear him, the latter hinting at his nocturnal excursions with the ""Black Man.""

Hester and Pearl pass by, having been at Governor Winthrop's deathbed. Dimmesdale calls them to join him on the scaffold. The three form an ""electric chain."" Pearl asks if he will stand with them ""to-morrow noontide."" Dimmesdale, overcome by fear of public exposure, refuses, but promises, ""At the great judgment day... thy mother, and thou, and I must stand together."" A meteoric ""A"" appears in the sky, which Dimmesdale's ""disordered mental state"" interprets as a sign for him. He then sees Pearl pointing at Chillingworth, who has approached the scaffold. Chillingworth's face reveals his ""malevolence,"" and Dimmesdale gasps, ""I hate him, Hester!"" Hester, bound by her oath, remains silent. Pearl whispers something ""gibberish"" when asked. Chillingworth, feigning concern, leads Dimmesdale home, attributing his presence on the scaffold to ""night-whimseys."" The next day, Dimmesdale preaches a powerful sermon, but the sexton finds his glove on the scaffold and reports the ""great red letter in the sky,"" interpreted as ""Angel"" for the deceased Governor Winthrop.

**XIII. Another View of Hester**
Hester is shocked by Dimmesdale's frail condition and realizes Chillingworth's torment is destroying him. After seven years of enduring public infamy, Hester has earned a measure of public respect through her charity and quiet dignity. The scarlet letter is now often interpreted as ""Able,"" a symbol of her strength and helpfulness as a ""Sister of Mercy."" However, her own character has become cold and intellectual. She is now resolved to reveal Chillingworth's true identity to Dimmesdale, recognizing her responsibility to rescue him from her former husband's grip. She finds Chillingworth gathering herbs in the forest.

**XIV. Hester and the Physician**
Hester sends Pearl to play by the brook and confronts Chillingworth. He informs her that the magistrates have discussed removing her scarlet letter, but Hester believes it must fall off naturally if she is worthy. Hester observes Chillingworth's transformation into an ""eager, searching, almost fierce"" and evil man, a ""devil"" consumed by revenge. She tells him she made a ""heavy wrong"" by keeping his secret, enabling his torment of Dimmesdale. Chillingworth boasts he has kept Dimmesdale alive to suffer, becoming a ""fiend"" for his ""especial torment."" Hester cries that it would have been ""Better he had died at once!"" Chillingworth, in a moment of self-awareness, sees his own moral ruin. Hester, admitting her shared culpability in his transformation, declares her intention to reveal his true character to Dimmesdale. Chillingworth, unable to pardon, says his hatred is their ""fate"" and tells Hester to ""deal as thou wilt with yonder man.""

**XV. Hester and Pearl**
Hester reflects on her hatred for Chillingworth, seeing his manipulation as a greater wrong than her own sin. Pearl returns, having made a green ""A"" from seaweed for her own breast. Pearl acutely observes that Dimmesdale keeps his hand over his heart ""for the same reason that the minister keeps his hand over his heart!"" Hester is unsettled by Pearl's insight. Pearl presses her mother to explain the scarlet letter and the minister's gesture. Hester deflects the questions, angered by Pearl's persistence.

**XVI. A Forest Walk**
Hester resolves to tell Dimmesdale about Chillingworth. She meets him in the forest. Dimmesdale appears haggard and feeble. Pearl notes the sunshine avoids Hester and runs to play in it herself. Pearl asks Hester about the ""Black Man"" who haunts the forest and marks people with his symbol. Hester admits, ""Once in my life I met the Black Man! This scarlet letter is his mark!"" Pearl then asks if Dimmesdale keeps his hand over his heart because the Black Man marked him there. Hester sends Pearl away to play.

**XVII. The Pastor and His Parishioner**
Hester calls out to Dimmesdale. They meet in the dim forest, like ghosts. Dimmesdale confesses he has found ""nothing but despair,"" tormented by his hidden sin and the people's reverence. He longs for someone to know him as the ""vilest of all sinners,"" as the truth would save him from ""falsehood!—all emptiness!—all death!"" Hester reveals that Chillingworth, the physician, is her husband. Dimmesdale reacts with a fierce frown and collapses, blaming Hester. Hester, embracing him, pleads for his forgiveness, which he eventually grants, saying Chillingworth's revenge is ""blacker than my sin."" They sit hand-in-hand, contemplating their escape. Hester urges him to leave Chillingworth, to flee into the wilderness or across the sea, to start a new life as a teacher or scholar. Dimmesdale feels too weak to go alone. Hester whispers, ""Thou shalt not go alone!""

**XVIII. A Flood of Sunshine**
Dimmesdale is filled with a mixture of hope, joy, and fear at Hester's daring proposal to flee together. Hester, having lived outside societal norms, feels free to speculate on a new life. Dimmesdale, constrained by his past and profession, struggles with the idea. He resolves to flee with Hester. Hester unclasps the scarlet letter from her bosom and throws it away among the leaves. The burden of shame lifts, her beauty and youthful warmth return, and the gloomy forest is suddenly filled with sunshine. She urges Dimmesdale to accept Pearl. Dimmesdale expresses unease with children but remembers Pearl's rare kindness to him. Hester calls Pearl, who approaches slowly.

**XIX. The Child at the Brook-Side**
Hester and Dimmesdale watch Pearl. Dimmesdale admits his fear that Pearl's features reveal their shared sin. Pearl reaches the brook, but will not cross it. She points at Hester's bare bosom and then at her own green ""A"" made of seaweed. Hester realizes Pearl expects her to wear the scarlet letter. Dimmesdale, agitated, urges Hester to pacify the child. Hester retrieves the scarlet letter from the leaves and re-fastens it to her bosom. Immediately, her beauty and cheerfulness vanish, replaced by a ""gray shadow."" Pearl then bounds across the brook, embraces Hester, and kisses her, but also kisses the scarlet letter, causing Hester anguish. Pearl asks if Dimmesdale will walk with them, ""hand in hand, we three together, into the town?"" Hester promises a future home, but says ""Not now, dear child."" Pearl asks if the minister will ""always keep his hand over his heart?"" Pearl, perhaps out of jealousy, refuses Dimmesdale's embrace and washes off his kiss in the brook. Hester and Dimmesdale make plans for their departure.

**XX. The Minister in a Maze**
Dimmesdale departs, reflecting on his decision to flee with Hester and Pearl to Europe on a ship sailing in three days, after he delivers his Election Sermon. He experiences a strange sense of unreality and a revolution in his inner being, feeling impulses to commit strange, wicked acts. He barely restrains himself from blasphemous remarks to a deacon, from suggesting atheistic ideas to an old church member, from corrupting a young maiden he converted, from teaching wicked words to children, and from carousing with a drunken sailor. Mistress Hibbins confronts him, hinting at his secret forest meeting with the ""Black Man"" and asserting that his hidden mark will be revealed. Dimmesdale questions if he has sold himself to the fiend. He returns to his study, finding it strange, and recognizes that his ""former self was gone."" Chillingworth enters, and Dimmesdale, despite feigning health, realizes Chillingworth knows his secret. Dimmesdale rejects Chillingworth's medical help, feeling a new strength. Alone, he burns his old Election Sermon and writes a new, inspired one all night with intense ecstasy.

**XXI. The New England Holiday**
On Election Day, Hester and Pearl are in the market-place, which is bustling with townspeople, Indians, and mariners. Hester wears her gray dress and the scarlet letter, which, after seven years, is a familiar, though still potent, symbol. She feels a sense of quiet triumph, anticipating her freedom. Pearl is adorned in magnificent, brightly colored clothes, her vivacity reflecting her mother's hidden agitation. Pearl observes the festive scene, asking why everyone is merry and if the minister will greet them. Hester tells her he will not greet them publicly. Pearl observes the minister still keeps his hand over his heart. Mistress Hibbins again appears, hinting at Dimmesdale's secret compact with the ""Black Man"" and predicting his mark will be revealed. Pearl eagerly asks about this.

A procession of magistrates, soldiers, and ministers approaches for the Election Sermon. Roger Chillingworth is seen in familiar conversation with the shipmaster of the Bristol vessel. The shipmaster later tells Hester that Chillingworth has arranged to sail with them on the same ship, claiming to be ""of your party, and a close friend to the gentleman you spoke of."" Hester is inwardly alarmed by this news, realizing Chillingworth has discovered their escape plan. She sees Chillingworth smiling ominously across the market-place.

**XXII. The Procession**
The procession begins with music and military escort. Mr. Dimmesdale appears, walking with unusual energy and an abstracted, inspired air, showing no sign of feebleness or his hand on his heart. Hester watches, feeling his remoteness and questioning if their forest plans were a delusion. Pearl asks if it was the same minister who kissed her by the brook, noting his changed demeanor in public. Mistress Hibbins again approaches Hester, revealing her knowledge of Dimmesdale's secret forest activities with the ""Black Man"" and predicting his mark will be exposed to the world. Pearl eagerly questions Mistress Hibbins about this. Hester, compelled by an ""irresistible feeling,"" stands beside the scaffold, listening to Dimmesdale's eloquent Election Sermon. His powerful voice, even when muffled, conveys a deep ""cry of pain.""

**XXIII. The Revelation of the Scarlet Letter**
Dimmesdale's sermon concludes with immense public acclaim. He stands at the height of his professional triumph, hailed as a saint. As the procession moves towards the town-hall banquet, Dimmesdale appears feeble and pale, his strength seemingly drained. He rejects Mr. Wilson's offer of support. Dimmesdale, tottering, approaches the scaffold where Hester and Pearl stand. Governor Bellingham moves to assist him, but Dimmesdale's expression warns him back.

Dimmesdale calls Hester and Pearl to him. Pearl flies to his knees, and Hester slowly approaches. Roger Chillingworth rushes forward, trying to stop Dimmesdale, whispering, ""Madman, hold! what is your purpose?... I can yet save you!"" Dimmesdale, confronting Chillingworth, declares, ""Ha, tempter! Methinks thou art too late! ... With God’s help, I shall escape thee now!"" He calls on Hester for her strength to help him ascend the scaffold, despite Chillingworth's opposition.

Leaning on Hester and holding Pearl's hand, Dimmesdale ascends the scaffold. Chillingworth follows, lamenting that Dimmesdale has escaped him on this very scaffold. Dimmesdale, trembling, asks Hester if this public revelation is better than their forest dream; she replies, ""I know not!"" Dimmesdale declares himself a dying man and makes haste to ""take my shame upon me!""

He addresses the appalled multitude, confessing he is ""the one sinner of the world!"" He states he should have stood there seven years ago with Hester and that the scarlet letter she wears is but a ""shadow of what he bears on his own breast."" With a convulsive motion, he tears open his ministerial band, revealing a scarlet letter (or its semblance) imprinted in his flesh. The crowd is horror-stricken. Dimmesdale, with a ""flush of triumph,"" collapses onto the scaffold. Hester supports him. Chillingworth kneels beside him, distraught, repeating, ""Thou hast escaped me!"" Dimmesdale, dying, tells Chillingworth, ""May God forgive thee! Thou, too, hast deeply sinned!""

Dimmesdale turns to Pearl, asking for a kiss, which she previously refused in the forest. Pearl kisses his lips, breaking a ""spell."" Her tears fall on his cheek, symbolizing her transition to womanhood, capable of human joy and sorrow. Her ""errand as a messenger of anguish"" to her mother is fulfilled. Hester asks if they will meet again in immortal life. Dimmesdale, with ""tremulous solemnity,"" says their broken law and revealed sin make it vain to hope for a pure reunion, and that God's mercy was shown through his tortures and this ""death of triumphant ignominy."" He dies with a final ""Farewell!"" The multitude murmurs in awe.

**XXIV. Conclusion**
After Dimmesdale's death, multiple accounts circulate regarding what was seen on his breast. Most witnesses reported a scarlet letter imprinted in his flesh, attributed to self-inflicted penance, Chillingworth's magic, or the gnawing of remorse. However, some spectators, particularly his friends, denied any mark, claiming Dimmesdale's death was a parable teaching humility and God's mercy. The narrator, referencing Surveyor Pue's manuscript, affirms the existence of the mark, and concludes with the moral: ""Be true! Be true! Be true! Show freely to the world, if not your worst, yet some trait whereby the worst may be inferred!""

Roger Chillingworth, his purpose of revenge now ""consummated,"" withers away and dies within a year. His considerable property is bequeathed to little Pearl. Pearl, now a rich heiress, and Hester then disappear. Years later, Hester Prynne returns to her old cottage in Boston, still wearing the scarlet letter. There are indications (letters, luxuries, a baby-garment embroidered by Hester) that Pearl is alive, married, happy, and mindful of her mother, living in another land. Hester chooses to remain in New England, resuming the scarlet letter, which over time loses its stigma and becomes a symbol of awe and reverence. Women, burdened by their own sorrows and passions, seek Hester's counsel. Hester offers comfort and expresses her belief that a ""new truth"" will one day establish a better relationship between man and woman, to be revealed by a ""lofty, pure, and beautiful"" prophetess.

After many years, Hester dies and is buried in a new grave near Dimmesdale's old, sunken one, with a space between them. One simple slate tombstone covers both, bearing an engraved escutcheon with the motto: ""ON A FIELD, SABLE, THE LETTER A, GULES"" (a scarlet letter A on a black background)."
Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea-Jules Verne,"The year 1866 was marked by a puzzling phenomenon: an enormous, spindle-shaped, phosphorescent object, faster and larger than any known whale, was sighted by numerous vessels across the globe. Initial sightings by the *Governor Higginson* off Australia and the *Columbus* in the Pacific noted its aquatic nature and incredible speed. Later, the *Helvetia* and *Shannon* observed it simultaneously in the Atlantic, estimating its length at over 350 feet. Public opinion was divided, but a series of collisions, notably with the *Moravian* (which lost part of its keel) and the *Scotia* (which sustained a two-yard triangular gash from an unknown instrument), confirmed it as a real and dangerous entity.

M. Pierre Aronnax, an Assistant Professor of Natural History in Paris, was in New York preparing to return to France when these events unfolded. Drawing on his expertise, he published an article in the *New York Herald* proposing the existence of a gigantic, electric narwhal, capable of the observed destruction due to its immense strength and a powerful horn. His theory gained traction, leading the United States government to launch an expedition to hunt the creature. The frigate *Abraham Lincoln*, commanded by Captain Farragut, was commissioned for this purpose. Aronnax was invited to join, representing France, and accepted, accompanied by his devoted, phlegmatic servant, Conseil. On board, they met Ned Land, a Canadian harpooner of exceptional skill, who was the only one to doubt the monster's biological nature.

After three months of fruitless searching in the North Pacific, Commander Farragut promised to abandon the hunt if the monster didn't appear in three more days. On the final night, November 5, 1867, Ned Land sighted a brilliant, electric light on the frigate's starboard beam. The object, which Aronnax identified as electrical and moving, approached the *Abraham Lincoln* with astonishing speed, encircling it with luminous rings before disappearing and reappearing. Captain Farragut, deciding to wait for daylight, had the frigate keep pace with the mysterious entity.

The next morning, after the fog cleared, the creature was seen a mile and a half away—a long, blackish body, about 250 feet long, expelling steam and water jets. The *Abraham Lincoln* pursued it at full steam (18.5 miles per hour), but the animal effortlessly matched or exceeded their speed, often toying with them. Despite firing a powerful breech-loading gun, which struck the animal but failed to penetrate its rounded surface, the chase yielded no results. That night, Captain Farragut ordered a stealthy approach while the creature appeared motionless. Ned Land, from under the bowsprit, launched his harpoon, striking what felt like a hard body. The electric light vanished, two massive waterspouts erupted over the frigate, and a powerful shock threw Aronnax into the sea.

In the dark, suffocating water, Aronnax was saved by Conseil, who had followed him. Conseil reported the frigate's screw and rudder were broken by the monster. Exhausted, Aronnax nearly drowned but was rescued by Ned Land, who had also been thrown overboard. Ned revealed they were on the ""gigantic narwhal,"" which he discovered was made of ""sheet iron""—a submarine boat.

Eight masked men from inside the boat forcibly abducted Aronnax, Conseil, and Ned Land into the mysterious craft. They were confined to a dark cabin, which was then illuminated by intense electric light. Two men entered: one muscular, the other, the chief, with striking, intelligent eyes. They spoke an unknown language. Aronnax, Ned, and Conseil tried speaking French, English, German, and Latin, but the men showed no comprehension. The chief and his companion left. Later, a steward, who appeared mute or deaf, brought them strange, all-sea-based food served on dishes marked with the letter ""N"" and the motto ""MOBILIS IN MOBILI."" Aronnax deduced ""N"" was the commander's initial.

After a long sleep, Aronnax noticed the air quality had deteriorated, then a fresh breeze filled the cabin, indicating the submarine had surfaced to refresh its air. Ned Land, impatient from hunger, attacked the returning steward, only to be stopped by the chief, who spoke perfect French. The chief revealed he had understood them all along, stating he knew their identities and that they had unintentionally disturbed his secluded life. He declared he was ""not what you call a civilised man"" and lived outside human laws, having broken all ties with humanity. He offered them life on board, but on the condition they would never leave and would submit to confinement if he had ""secrets"" to hide. Ned Land refused to give his word not to escape, to which the chief coldly responded he hadn't asked for it. Aronnax, angered, accused him of cruelty. The chief countered that he was being clement, as they were ""prisoners of war"" who had attacked him and tried to penetrate the secret of his existence. He introduced himself as Captain Nemo, and his vessel as the *Nautilus*.

Captain Nemo then gave Aronnax a tour. The *Nautilus* was a masterpiece of engineering: 232 feet long, cigar-shaped, with a double steel hull, powered entirely by electricity derived from sodium extracted from seawater. It could travel at 50 miles per hour. It navigated horizontally with a rudder, and vertically using inclined planes, or by taking on/expelling water from reservoirs. A steersman in a glazed cage, aided by an electric reflector, guided the vessel. Nemo confirmed the collision with the *Scotia* was accidental, and the attack on the *Abraham Lincoln* was self-defense. He revealed the *Nautilus* was built in secret on a desert island by him and his devoted crew, costing an immense fortune he possessed.

The *Nautilus* navigated the Indian Ocean, revealing stunning underwater landscapes through its saloon windows, populated by myriad fish and zoophytes, all lit by electric light. Aronnax, Conseil, and Ned Land joined Captain Nemo on a submarine hunt in the ""forests"" of Crespo Island, donning advanced diving suits with compressed air reservoirs (9-10 hours supply) and electric lamps. Nemo carried a gun firing electric glass cases. They walked on the seabed, observing vibrant coral, sea plants, and marine life. Ned Land, attempting to provide fresh meat, shot a sea-otter and an albatross on the island's surface, which they reached after their underwater trek. They narrowly escaped two formidable sharks due to Captain Nemo's quick action.

The *Nautilus* continued its journey. In the Indian Ocean, Aronnax saw the wreck of the *Florida, Sunderland* with its dead crew. Later, at Vanikoro, Captain Nemo revealed he had found the tin box containing the last instructions of La Perouse, whose ships had been lost there, implying a ""coral tomb"" for him and his crew. Passing through the treacherous Torres Straits, the *Nautilus* ran aground on a coral reef. Ned Land saw this as an opportunity to escape, but Captain Nemo, relying on the spring tide to refloat the vessel, granted them permission to go ashore on Gilboa Island. They hunted birds and a hog, collecting fruits and vegetables, until attacked by a hundred Papuan natives. Returning to the *Nautilus*, they found Captain Nemo serenely playing his organ. He calmly ordered the hatches closed, and when the Papuans tried to board the surfaced vessel, he electrocuted the metal stair-rail, repelling them without bloodshed. The *Nautilus* then refloated with the high tide.

Captain Nemo revealed a secret subterranean passage, the ""Arabian Tunnel,"" connecting the Red Sea to the Mediterranean beneath the Isthmus of Suez, which the *Nautilus* traversed in less than twenty minutes. In the Mediterranean, Ned Land expressed a strong desire to escape near Europe. Aronnax, though keen on his studies, agreed to seize a ""favourable opportunity."" During this time, Captain Nemo showed Aronnax the submerged ruins of Atlantis, a vast ancient city, located within an active submarine volcano. Later, the *Nautilus* visited an underground coal-mine within an extinct volcano, which provided the sodium necessary for its electricity.

The *Nautilus* then journeyed through the Sargasso Sea and into the South Atlantic. One night, Captain Nemo proposed an expedition to the South Pole. Despite Ned Land's incredulity and the late season, Nemo was determined to go ""under"" the ice. The *Nautilus* submerged and navigated beneath massive icebergs. On March 19, 1868, after several attempts to break through the ice ceiling, the *Nautilus* emerged into open water at the South Pole. Captain Nemo, stepping onto a volcanic island, claimed possession of the region in his own name and unfurled a black flag with a gold ""N.""

As they prepared to leave the Pole, a massive iceberg capsized, striking the *Nautilus* and trapping it on its side, 180 fathoms deep within an ice tunnel. Nemo confirmed it was an ""accident."" They were imprisoned, with only two days' worth of air remaining in their reservoirs. Nemo, Conseil, Ned, and the crew began excavating the ice wall with pickaxes. Aronnax discovered the surrounding water was solidifying, threatening to crush the vessel. Nemo devised a plan to inject boiling water from the *Nautilus*'s distillatory machines to prevent further freezing. After days of strenuous work and suffocating conditions (during which Ned and Conseil sacrificed their remaining oxygen to save Aronnax), Captain Nemo managed to crush the remaining ice by filling the reservoirs, causing the *Nautilus* to sink rapidly and then shoot through the final ice layer, surfacing into pure air.

Revived, they continued north through the Atlantic, passing Cape Horn, Terra del Fuego, the Falklands, and the mouth of the Amazon. Ned Land's desire for escape grew. Captain Nemo, becoming more withdrawn, showed Aronnax his personal manuscript—a record of his life and studies, which he intended to seal in a floating case and cast into the sea for posterity. He reiterated that none who entered the *Nautilus* would ever leave, revealing a deep-seated hatred for human society, yet hinting at his immense charity for ""oppressed races."" Aronnax realized Nemo used his vast wealth to aid unknown causes, like the Cretan diver who received a chest of gold.

Off the coast of New York, a hurricane struck, which Captain Nemo chose to brave on the surface. During the storm, Ned Land resolved to escape, convincing Aronnax and Conseil. Later, the *Nautilus* found the wreck of the French warship *Avenger*, sunk 74 years prior in battle. Captain Nemo recounted its history with profound emotion, revealing a powerful, personal hatred for the ""accursed nation"" that sunk it. Suddenly, a modern warship appeared and began firing at the *Nautilus*. Ned Land attempted to signal for help but was violently stopped by Captain Nemo, who unfurled his black flag, declaring himself ""the law and the judge"" and ""the oppressed."" He refused to identify the attacking warship and ordered Aronnax and his companions below, stating he would sink it.

Aronnax, Ned, and Conseil decided to escape as the *Nautilus* began its attack. However, as they made their move, Captain Nemo submerged the vessel. From the saloon, they watched in horror as the *Nautilus* rammed the warship below the waterline, piercing it ""like a needle through sailcloth."" The ship sank rapidly, its decks blowing up from compressed air, carrying its crew to the depths. Captain Nemo, an ""archangel of hatred,"" watched the destruction. Afterwards, Aronnax followed him to his room, where Nemo knelt before a portrait of a young woman and two children, bursting into deep sobs.

The *Nautilus* then sped northward at a frightful pace, deep underwater or just below the surface, through northern fogs. Aronnax lost all sense of time, the clocks on board having stopped. Captain Nemo and his second were never seen. Ned Land, consumed by taciturnity and despair, was constantly watched by Conseil. One unknown morning, Ned woke Aronnax, saying they would escape that night, as the *Nautilus* seemed abandoned and within twenty miles of land. Aronnax agreed, resigned to any fate.

At 10 PM, under the dark, moonless sky, Aronnax joined Ned and Conseil in the boat. Ned used a false key to unbolt the boat from the *Nautilus*. Suddenly, loud voices and cries erupted from inside the submarine: ""The maelstrom! the maelstrom!"" They realized the *Nautilus* was being drawn into the Maelstrom, a giant whirlpool off the Norwegian coast. The boat, still fastened to the *Nautilus*, was carried along in a dizzying spiral. Ned desperately tried to hold on, but with a crashing noise, the bolts gave way, and their boat was hurled into the maelstrom. Aronnax hit his head and lost consciousness.

Aronnax has no recollection of how they escaped the Maelstrom. He awoke in a fisherman's hut on the Loffoden Isles, with Ned Land and Conseil safe beside him. He revised his journal, affirming its factual accuracy. He ends by wondering about the fate of the *Nautilus* and Captain Nemo, hoping the vessel survived and that Nemo's hatred has been appeased, allowing the ""philosopher"" to continue his peaceful exploration of the sea. Aronnax concludes that only he and Captain Nemo have the right to answer the ancient question: ""That which is far off and exceeding deep, who can find it out?"""
Ulysses-James Joyce,"The narrative of ""Ulysses"" follows a day in Dublin, Ireland, primarily focusing on two characters, Stephen Dedalus and Leopold Bloom, and concludes with a lengthy monologue by Molly Bloom.

**Chapter 1:**
The morning begins at a Martello tower overlooking Dublin Bay. Buck Mulligan, a medical student, performs a mock Mass using a shaving bowl and razor, then calls to Stephen Dedalus, who is displeased and sleepy. Haines, an Englishman, is also present. Mulligan teases Stephen about his Greek name and his refusal to kneel and pray for his dying mother, whom Mulligan’s aunt believes Stephen killed. Stephen, in turn, mentions Haines was ""raving all night about a black panther."" Mulligan borrows Stephen's handkerchief to wipe his razor, then jokes about its ""snotgreen"" color. He talks about the sea as a ""great sweet mother"" and says Stephen's aunt thinks Stephen killed his mother. Stephen gloomily admits, ""Someone killed her."" Mulligan continues to mock Stephen's refusal to pray for his mother. Stephen recalls his mother's death and her illness. Mulligan then observes that Haines thinks Stephen is ""not a gentleman"" and calls Stephen ""Kinch, the knife-blade."" He jokes about Stephen's ""g.p.i."" (general paralysis of the insane). Stephen complains that Mulligan often teases him. Mulligan tries to persuade Stephen to work with him for Ireland. Stephen asks how long Haines is staying; Mulligan calls Haines a ""ponderous Saxon"" but then defends him. Stephen reveals he was scared by Haines's raving about shooting a black panther and threatens to leave if Haines stays. Mulligan, noticing lather on his razor, asks Stephen for his handkerchief again, joking about ""the bard's noserag"" and calling it ""snotgreen."" He then speaks of the sea and the Greeks, offering to teach Stephen. Stephen looks at the mailboat. Mulligan again brings up Stephen's mother and his refusal to kneel. Stephen replies he is not thinking of the offense to his mother, but ""of the offence to me."" Mulligan, annoyed, walks off. A voice calls for Mulligan, who replies he's coming and that ""The Sassenach wants his morning rashers."" He leaves, singing. Stephen reflects on his mother's death, her suffering, and feels a deep sorrow. Mulligan returns, calling Stephen for breakfast, saying Haines is apologizing. He suggests Stephen ""touch him for a quid."" Stephen says he gets paid today. Mulligan asks for a loan, then cheerfully sings about drinking. Stephen picks up his ashplant and locks the tower door as they leave. Outside, Haines joins them. They discuss the tower's rent and Hamlet. Mulligan suggests Stephen's Hamlet theory is that ""Hamlet’s grandson is Shakespeare’s grandfather and that he himself is the ghost of his own father."" Stephen confirms his theory is long to tell. Haines mentions the tower reminds him of Elsinore and a ""theological interpretation"" of Hamlet concerning ""The Father and the Son idea."" Mulligan then launches into a blasphemous song about ""Joseph the Joiner"" and ""joking Jesus,"" before running off towards the Forty Foot Hole. Haines and Stephen walk on, discussing belief. Haines offers Stephen a cigarette. Stephen, feeling like a servant of two masters (English and Italian Church) and a third (who wants him for odd jobs), reflects on various heresies. They pass a businessman and a boatman discussing a drowned man. They descend to the creek where Mulligan is preparing to swim. Mulligan asks Stephen for the key and some money for a pint. Stephen gives him both. Mulligan plunges into the water. Haines says they'll see Bloom at The Ship at half past twelve. Stephen walks away, hearing a voice from the sea and feeling Mulligan is a ""usurper.""

**Chapter 2:**
Stephen Dedalus is teaching a class of young boys. He questions a boy, Cochrane, about Pyrrhus, then Armstrong. The boys laugh at Armstrong’s answer about a pier. Stephen reflects on the nature of history and memory, and the boys' innocence or lack thereof. He asks Talbot to read from ""Lycidas."" Stephen reflects on philosophical concepts and his personal past. He then asks a riddle about a fox burying his grandmother, which the boys cannot solve. After he gives the answer, the boys cry out in dismay and run off for hockey. Sargent, one boy, stays behind, needing help with his sums. Stephen helps him, while internally reflecting on Sargent's mother and his own deceased mother, imagining her in her grave. He solves the problem for Sargent. Mr. Deasy, the school owner, enters, fussily dealing with the boys outside. He and Stephen discuss their ""financial settlement."" Deasy pays Stephen three pounds twelve shillings. Bloom thinks about the money owed to him by various people. Deasy advises Stephen to save and talks about money as power, quoting Shakespeare (Iago). Deasy expresses pride in the English and their boast, ""I paid my way."" He then asks Stephen to do him a favor by taking a letter to the press about foot and mouth disease, which he believes is ruining Ireland. Deasy expresses his anti-Semitic views, claiming ""England is in the hands of the jews."" Stephen counters that ""A merchant... is one who buys cheap and sells dear, jew or gentile."" Deasy then states, ""History... is a nightmare from which I am trying to awake."" He claims ""All human history moves towards one great goal, the manifestation of God,"" but Stephen points to a shout in the street, saying ""That is God."" Deasy laments that ""A woman brought sin into the world."" He predicts Stephen won't remain a teacher. Stephen agrees he is ""A learner rather."" Deasy asks Stephen to get his letter published in two papers. Stephen agrees. As Stephen leaves, Deasy calls him back to add, ""Ireland, they say, has the honour of being the only country which never persecuted the jews... Because she never let them in."" Deasy laughs heartily.

**Chapter 3:**
Stephen walks alone on Sandymount strand, reflecting on the ""ineluctable modality of the visible"" and audible. He thinks about his boots, his ashplant, and the sound of the waves. He closes and opens his eyes, pondering existence. He sees two women and a baby coming down to the sea, reflecting on birth and his own mother. He considers going to his aunt Sara’s house but decides not to. He thinks about his time in Paris and a telegram from his mother. He then thinks about his uncle Richie and other family members, and their financial struggles. He continues walking on the sand, observing the landscape, including ""broken hoops,"" ""dark cunning nets,"" and ""two crucified shirts."" He sees a porterbottle stuck in the sand. He reflects on his past, his literary ambitions, and his mother's death. He then sees a dog running on the sand, followed by two figures (a woman and a man). He identifies the dog as belonging to his enemy and contemplates the idea of drowning and his inability to save his mother. He watches the dog interact with the couple, and then sniff at a dead dog's carcass. He sees the man kick the dog, who then urinates against a rock and digs in the sand. Stephen remembers a dream about ""street of harlots."" He observes the woman and man walking away, thinking of their ""unclean loins."" He thinks about his letter to Martha and scribbles words on a rock, realizing he forgot to take slips from the library. He reflects on his shadow and who might read his words. He thinks of a girl he saw in Hodges Figgis's window and his loneliness. He lies on the rocks, feeling tired. He thinks of his boots and a girl named Esther Osvalt. He observes the tide coming in and flowing out, thinking of a drowned man. He reflects on his own mortality, his bad teeth, and the need for a dentist. He realizes he lost his handkerchief. He picks dry snot from his nostril and places it on a rock. He then sees a three-master ship sailing silently.

**Chapter 4:**
Mr. Leopold Bloom is in his kitchen, preparing breakfast for his wife, Molly. He enjoys the inner organs of animals and plans to buy a grilled mutton kidney. He interacts with his cat, pouring it milk. He goes upstairs to the bedroom, softly asking Molly if she wants anything for breakfast; she grunts a sleepy ""Mn."" He notices her old bedstead and thinks of her father, Old Tweedy. He finds his latchkey is not in his hip pocket, but in another pair of trousers. He quietly leaves the house, avoiding a loose cellar flap. He walks to Dlugacz's pork butcher's, observing various details of the street and people. He sees a young woman buying sausages and is drawn to her figure. He buys a pork kidney and reflects on a model farm in Kinnereth and his wife's tastes in olives and oranges. He contemplates the Dead Sea and its desolation. Feeling a ""grey horror,"" he hurries home. He finds two letters and a card for Molly and himself. Milly, his daughter, wrote to him; a card and a letter are for Molly. In the bedroom, he gives Molly her mail. She reads the card, then hides her letter under her pillow. Molly asks for her tea. Bloom delays, tidying her clothes. Downstairs, Molly calls for him to scald the teapot. He prepares the tea and the kidney, giving the cat the burnt flesh. He reads Milly's letter, which thanks him for a birthday present, mentions her photography job, a picnic, and a young student named Bannon who sings Boylan's song about seaside girls. Bloom reflects on Milly's growing up. He then thinks about Molly and her attractiveness. He feels a ""soft qualm, regret,"" about her. He decides to use the outhouse. In the jakes, he reads a prize story from ""Titbits"" and uses half of it to wipe himself. The bells of George's church toll ""Quarter to"" eleven, reminding him of poor Dignam.

**Chapter 5:**
Mr. Bloom walks along Sir John Rogerson’s quay, passing various businesses and people, including a boy with a bucket of offal. He thinks about Dignam’s funeral, which is at eleven. He stops at the Belfast and Oriental Tea Company window, then adjusts his hat, revealing a white slip of paper inside the headband, which he moves to his waistcoat pocket. He reflects on Ceylon and the weight of falling bodies. He walks towards the post office and checks for letters, receiving one addressed to ""Henry Flower Esq."" He slips the card and letter into his pocket, observing a recruiting poster. He encounters M’Coy, who asks about his well-being. Bloom explains he is attending Dignam’s funeral. M'Coy asks Bloom to ""put down my name at the funeral"" because he might be busy with a drowning case. Bloom agrees. He then reflects on the lady he saw getting into a carriage and Molly's upcoming concert tour. He considers M'Coy's request as a ""soft mark."" Bloom buys a cake of lemon soap from Sweny’s chemist. Outside, he meets Bantam Lyons, who asks to see his newspaper for a horse racing tip. Bloom, intending to throw the paper away, tells Lyons he can keep it. Lyons, surprised, takes it, believing Bloom is giving him an insider tip. Bloom smiles, reflecting on betting and fraud. He walks towards the public baths, anticipating a relaxing bath.

**Chapter 6:**
Martin Cunningham, Mr. Power, and Simon Dedalus board a carriage for Paddy Dignam's funeral. Mr. Bloom joins them, taking the last vacant seat. He feels something hard in his hip pocket and realizes it’s the soap he bought. They discuss the custom of funerals and pass Stephen Dedalus, walking alone. Simon Dedalus is annoyed that Stephen is with Mulligan, whom he calls a ""ruffian."" Bloom reflects on his deceased son, Rudy, and his desire for a son. They discuss Molly and Milly. The carriage hits a bump, and they notice crumbs on the seats, suggesting a previous ""picnic party."" Mr. Dedalus implies Mulligan was involved. Martin Cunningham asks if Tom Kernan turned up; Bloom confirms he's behind with Ned Lambert and Hynes. Corny Kelleher is already at the cemetery. The carriage stops near the Grand Canal. They observe the gasworks and a raindrop falls. They discuss the weather and the upcoming Gordon Bennett race. Mr. Dedalus comments on a newspaper article. Bloom looks through the deaths column, seeing Dignam's name. He recalls tearing up Martha Clifford's envelope. He thinks about the tram system and a man in a buff suit. They pass the Queen's theatre and advertising hoardings. Blazes Boylan passes by in a carriage, flashing a white straw hat. Bloom reflects on Boylan's influence over Molly. He gives evasive answers about Molly's concert tour, saying he has ""private business"" in County Clare. He thinks about the statue of Smith O'Brien. They pass an old man selling bootlaces. Bloom thinks about Molly's singing. He passes a blackbearded figure who is bent on a stick. They discuss a story about Reuben J Dodd and his son, who fell into the Liffey. Martin Cunningham recounts how a boatman saved the son, for which Reuben J paid a florin. Mr. Dedalus comments it was ""One and eightpence too much."" They discuss Dignam's sudden death, which Bloom considers ""the best death"" due to ""no suffering."" They pass a small coffin, implying a child's funeral. The conversation turns to suicide, which Mr. Power calls ""the greatest disgrace."" Bloom remains silent, but thinks of his father's suicide. They arrive at Prospect Cemetery, passing a stonecutter's yard and an old tramp. Mr. Power points out the house where Childs was murdered. They discuss the legal case. They enter the mortuary chapel. The coffin is on a bier with candles. Bloom kneels, placing his unfolded newspaper under his knee. A priest, Father Coffey, performs a service in Latin. Bloom reflects on the coldness of the place and the meaning of the Latin words. He thinks about the bad gas from corpses. He remembers Molly mentioning I.H.S. He considers Martha Clifford. The priest closes the book, and gravediggers take the coffin out. The mourners follow. Mr. Dedalus weeps at his wife's grave. Mr. Kernan and Bloom discuss the service. Mr. Kernan prefers the Irish church service. Bloom's internal monologue continues about death and the body. John Henry Menton asks who Bloom is. Ned Lambert reveals Bloom's wife is the soprano Marion Tweedy. Menton recalls dancing with her and asks what Bloom does. Lambert says he was a ""traveller for blottingpaper."" Menton wonders why she married a ""coon like that."" The gravediggers lower the coffin. Bloom counts the bare heads, noting a ""chap in the macintosh is thirteen."" He reflects on the finality of death. Hynes asks Bloom's name for his notebook and Bloom gives it, also adding M'Coy's name. They walk past Parnell's grave. Bloom reflects on how much money is spent on burials. He sees an old rat. He thinks about cremation and the ""tower of silence."" He feels the presence of other dead people and resolves to live. John Henry Menton, finding his hat crushed, is helped by Martin Cunningham, but ignores Bloom's attempt to offer assistance.

**Chapter 7:**
Trams move around Nelson's Pillar. Shoeblacks work outside the post office. Draymen unload barrels of Guinness. Red Murray, a journalist, talks to Mr. Bloom at the Freeman's Journal office. Bloom is there to place an advertisement for Alexander Keyes. Murray cuts out the ad. Mr. William Brayden, a stately figure, enters the office. Murray whispers to Bloom that Brayden's face is like ""Our Saviour."" Bloom suggests ""Mario the tenor."" Red Murray reports that ""His grace phoned down twice this morning."" A telegram boy delivers a message. Bloom thinks of Brayden as ""one of our saviours also"" for his role in circulation. Bloom enters the printing works, observing the noisy machines. Hynes is there, mentioning the funeral. Bloom speaks to Mr. Nannetti, the foreman, about changing Keyes' ad to feature two crossed keys with ""House of Keys"" at the top, an ""innuendo of home rule."" Nannetti agrees to the design. Bloom plans to get the design. The telephone rings, and Professor MacHugh answers, telling Bloom ""go to hell"" when Bloom asks to use it. Bloom leaves, promising to return. J.J. O'Molloy enters, looking for the editor. Ned Lambert, MacHugh, and O'Molloy discuss Dan Dawson's bombastic speech. Myles Crawford, the editor, enters and speaks boastfully of Irish military victories. Lenehan tells a riddle about an opera resembling a railway line (""The Rose of Castile""). Stephen Dedalus arrives with Mr. Deasy's letter. Crawford, recognizing Deasy as an ""old pelters,"" quickly reads the letter and scorns its content about foot-and-mouth disease, linking it to Deasy's wife throwing soup. Stephen explains the letter is not his. Crawford discusses historical Irish loyalty to lost causes. MacHugh delivers an oration contrasting Roman and Greek civilizations, highlighting Roman ""cloacal obsession."" Lenehan makes a joke. O'Molloy recounts a speech by Seymour Bushe. Stephen explains his Hamlet theory further, linking Shakespeare's life, his wife Anne Hathaway, and the death of his son Hamnet to the play. Russell and Eglinton debate Stephen's theory. Mulligan enters, making light of the literary discussion, and reveals he received a telegram from Stephen: ""The sentimentalist is he who would enjoy without incurring the immense debtorship for a thing done."" Mulligan jokes about Stephen's drinking and his father's financial situation. He then tells Stephen that ""The tramper Synge is looking for you... He heard you pissed on his halldoor."" Stephen denies this, saying it was Mulligan's ""contribution to literature."" Bloom is mentioned by MacHugh as being involved in ""the gentle art of advertisement."" The discussion touches on journalism and the ""great Gallaher."" Crawford boasts about Ignatius Gallaher's journalistic scoop about the Phoenix Park murders. The telephone rings again for Bloom, who is told to ""go to hell"" by Crawford. Crawford continues to boast about journalistic exploits. J.J. O'Molloy mentions hawkers selling postcards of Joe Brady (one of the Invincibles). The group discusses ""The grandeur that was Rome"" and then Ireland. Stephen presents his idea for a story called ""_A Pisgah Sight of Palestine_ or _The Parable of The Plums_."" They joke about it. Crawford and the others leave for Mooney's pub. Bloom, having failed to secure his ad, is left behind. Crawford dismisses Bloom's presence with a wave, saying ""Begone! The world is before you.""

**Chapter 8:**
Mr. Bloom, walking, thinks about ""Blood of the Lamb"" and the coming of Elijah. He sees Dilly Dedalus near Dillon's auction rooms and reflects on the break-up of homes after the mother leaves.

He throws crumpled paper balls to the gulls, then buys two Banbury cakes and throws the fragments into the Liffey. He thinks about poetry and the salted fish. He reads an advertisement for ""Kino's 11/- Trousers"" on a rowboat. He reflects on ""parallax"" and Molly's understanding of ""metempsychosis."" He sees a procession of sandwichmen advertising ""H. E. L. Y. S."" and reflects on their work and lack of profit from advertising. He thinks about his own advertising ideas and past work. He sees a blind stripling wanting to cross the street and helps him. He reflects on blindness and other senses. He thinks about his personal hygiene and the ""belly is the smoothest."" He passes a freemason's hall, recalling Sir Frederick Falkiner. He sees a placard for the Mirus bazaar. He stops at the Kildare Street Library. He sees ""straw hat in sunlight. Tan shoes. Turnedup trousers. It is. It is."" He realizes it is Stephen Dedalus. His heart races. He follows Stephen to the Museum gate. He doesn't want to be seen. He thrusts a crumpled paper (""Agendath Netaim"") into his pocket. He hides near the gate, feeling his heart race, and safely makes it past Stephen.

**Chapter 9:**
Stephen Dedalus is in the National Library, engaging in a discussion with John Eglinton, A.E. (Russell), and Mr. Best. The Quaker librarian, Mr. Lyster, is also present. Stephen is presenting his theory about Shakespeare's Hamlet, arguing that Shakespeare wrote the play based on his own life, particularly the death of his son Hamnet and his wife Anne Hathaway's infidelity. He asserts that Shakespeare, a ""ghost by absence"" and ""by death,"" speaks his own words to his son in the play. Russell finds this ""prying into the family life of a great man"" irrelevant to the plays themselves. Stephen defends his view, stating that ""A man of genius makes no mistakes. His errors are volitional and are the portals of discovery."" He likens his mother's role to Socrates' mother, bringing thoughts into the world. Best mentions Mallarmé's interpretation of Hamlet. Stephen connects Shakespeare's life to various characters in his plays. He posits that paternity is a ""mystical estate"" and ""a legal fiction."" Mulligan bursts in, holding a telegram from Stephen, which is a jocular philosophical statement. He reads it aloud, revealing Stephen's financial situation and a reference to his aunt. Mulligan teases Stephen about his supposed ""pederasty."" They discuss Wilde and Willie Hughes. Mulligan points out Bloom, saying he knows Stephen and his father, and jokes about Bloom being ""Greeker than the Greeks."" The discussion turns to Shakespeare's financial dealings and his will, specifically his ""secondbest bed."" Stephen argues that Shakespeare, a ""cornjobber and moneylender,"" left his wife the second-best bed because she was unfaithful. He theorizes that the theme of the ""false or the usurping or the adulterous brother"" is central to Shakespeare's works, rooted in an ""original sin."" Stephen claims ""Fatherhood... is unknown to man."" Mulligan, feigning pregnancy of ideas, suggests his own play: ""Everyman His Own Wife or A Honeymoon in the Hand (a national immorality in three orgasms) by Ballocky Mulligan."" The librarian (Lyster) is interested in Stephen's views. Stephen walks out, followed by Mulligan, who continues to mock him and sing. Mulligan sees Bloom at the turnstile, refers to him as ""the wandering jew,"" and warns Stephen that Bloom ""looked upon you to lust after you.""

**Chapter 12:**
The narrator, an unnamed man, is walking with Joe Hynes near Arbour Hill. They discuss a ""foxy thief"" named Geraghty who cheated Moses Herzog. Joe mentions he saw the ""prudent member"" (Bloom) counting fish. They decide to go to Barney Kiernan's pub to see ""the citizen."" The citizen, a fierce Irish nationalist, is there with his dog Garryowen. They order drinks. The citizen rails against ""foreign wars"" and English influence. The narrative shifts to an epic description of Ireland, its landscape, produce, and people, and then back to the pub. Alf Bergan and Bob Doran join them. Alf reveals that Denis Breen is walking around Dublin with a postcard saying ""U. p: up"" and intends to sue for libel. Joe and Alf laugh. The citizen, annoyed by the dog's growling, kicks it. Alf recounts how Breen went to Menton's and Collis and Ward's, and then was sent to the subsheriff's office for a joke. The narrative shifts to a spiritualist séance, where Paddy Dignam's spirit communicates, asking for his other boot and for C. K. (Corny Kelleher) not to ""pile it on"" regarding his funeral.

**Chapter 13:**
On Sandymount strand, Cissy Caffrey, Edy Boardman, and Gerty MacDowell are with Cissy's twin boys, Tommy and Jacky, and Edy's baby. The boys are building sandcastles and playing. Cissy tries to get the baby to talk. Tommy and Jacky quarrel over a sandcastle, with Jacky kicking it down. Cissy scolds them and cleans Tommy. Edy teases Tommy about Gerty being his sweetheart. Gerty MacDowell, lost in thought, is described in detail: her delicate appearance, her use of eyebrowleine, her hair, and her inner longing for a manly man who would understand her. She is secretly lame. She imagines her ideal life, a domestic scene with a husband and children, contrasting with her current unfulfilled state. She is dressed carefully, hoping to attract attention. The twins quarrel again, and Jacky kicks their ball towards the sea. A gentleman in black (Mr. Bloom) intercepts the ball. Cissy asks him to throw it back. He throws it, and it lands near Gerty's skirt. Gerty, wishing the ball hadn't come to her, kicks at it but misses, causing Cissy and Edy to laugh. She tries again, lifting her skirt slightly, and kicks the ball far away. She notices the gentleman (Bloom) looking at her with a ""wan and strangely drawn"" face, which she finds ""the saddest she had ever seen."" The sounds of a temperance retreat from a nearby church are heard. Gerty reflects on her father's drinking and her own goodness. She thinks about her mother's headaches and her role as a ""second mother"" in the house. The twins quarrel again. Cissy chases them. Cissy makes a show of her legs while running.

Bloom says his watch is stopped but he thinks it's after eight. Gerty feels a ""sensation rushing all over her"" and believes Bloom is ""literally worshipping at her shrine."" Edy and Cissy prepare to leave. Gerty, to show independence, tells them she can ""throw my cap at who I like because it’s leap year,"" asserting her freedom from Reggy Wylie. Cissy makes a crude joke, which Gerty blushes at. The fireworks from the Mirus bazaar begin. Gerty, remaining seated, leans back to watch them, revealing her legs to Bloom. She feels a ""divine, an entrancing blush"" and is trembling. She imagines him drawing her close. The fireworks burst. She glances at Bloom, a ""pathetic little glance of piteous protest,"" and he blushes. They part. As Gerty limps away, Bloom realizes she is lame. He reflects on her ""jilted beauty"" and his own sexual desires. He then thinks about Molly, Martha, and other women, and the nature of female desire and menstruation. He picks up a piece of paper on the strand, but cannot read it. He writes ""I."" in the sand, then effaces it. He sees a bat flying and thinks about metempsychosis. He hears George's church bells cooing ""Cuckoo.""

**Chapter 14:**
The scene is the National Maternity Hospital, where Mrs. Mina Purefoy is in prolonged labor. The narrative uses an archaic, evolving prose style. A group of men, including Stephen Dedalus and Leopold Bloom, are gathered. The opening emphasizes the importance of human procreation. The text explains the hospital's provision for mothers. Bloom, a ""man that on earth wandering far had fared,"" arrives at the house, feeling ""lone."" He is there for Mrs. Purefoy. He meets a nursingwoman (a nun), who tells him that Mrs. Purefoy has been in labor for three days. Bloom asks about Doctor O'Hare, and the nun replies that he died three years ago of ""bellycrab."" Bloom is saddened. He questions the nun about the dead man's death, and she tells him he was shriven and given holy rites. He is advised to consider his own ""last end that is thy death."" Bloom then asks about Mrs. Purefoy. The nursingwoman describes the difficult birth. A young medical student named Dixon arrives. Bloom and Dixon know each other from when Bloom sought healing for a chest wound inflicted by a ""dragon."" Bloom enters the ""castle"" (hospital) to rest. Inside, there is a board with ""frightful swords and knives"" and ""strange fishes withouten heads."" There is ""fecund wheatkidneys"" that swell like a ""vast mountain."" The learning knight (Dixon) pours Bloom a drink, which Bloom discreetly empties into his neighbor's glass. The nun appeals to them to stop their ""wassailing"" for the sake of the laboring woman. Stephen is present with other medical students (Lynch, Madden, Lenehan, Crotthers, Costello) and Bloom. They discuss birth and righteousness, with Madden arguing that the wife should live, even if the babe dies. Stephen, with his ""mien of a frere,"" argues about ""Godpossibled souls that we nightly impossibilise."" He speaks of Lilith, abortions, and how the Church values souls. He also discusses how the body can be infused with a soul and the canon law that a mother who dies in childbirth is a ""dam to bear beastly."" They ask Bloom if he would risk life to save life, but he evades the question. Bloom is grave, remembering his wife's labor and the death of his only son, Rudy. He grieves for Stephen's ""riotous"" life. Stephen pours drinks. He then gives a speech about ""time's ruins build eternity’s mansions"" and how ""in woman’s womb word is made flesh but in the spirit of the maker all flesh that passes becomes the word that shall not pass away."" He speaks of the ""second Eve"" and the ""sacred pigeon."" Punch Costello tries to sing a bawdy song but is interrupted by nurse Quigley, who demands order.

Lenehan implies Stephen ""besmirched the lily virtue of a confiding female."" Stephen asserts he is ""the eternal son and ever virgin."" They joke about ""disrobing and deflowering of spouses"" like priests in Madagascar. Stephen recounts a poem from ""Maid's Tragedy."" Stephen argues that Shakespeare's ""theme of the false or the usurping or the adulterous brother or all three in one"" is always with him, and links this to ""original sin."" He asserts paternity is a legal fiction and that Shakespeare was his ""own father."" He then lists Shakespeare's brothers and their names in plays. Stephen then mentions ""that brother motive"" in Irish myths. Mulligan enters with Alec Bannon. Mulligan proposes a ""national fertilising farm"" on Lambay Island, named ""Omphalos,"" to encourage procreation, where he would offer his services. Dixon mocks him. The Scotch student (Crotthers) congratulates Mulligan and mentions a locket he carries. Mulligan describes a ""lady"" in ""artless disorder."" Lynch proposes a ""two things"" for which ""innocence of our original garb... is the fittest... only garment."" Miss Callan, a nurse, enters and informs Dixon that the lady in labor has given birth to a ""bouncing boy."" The students cheer. Costello makes a lewd comment. Dixon rebukes them for disrespecting the nursing profession and the ""house of Horne."" Bloom, having observed the ""impudent mocks,"" reflects on the students' ""extravagancies."" He tells his neighbor that the birth is good news. He thinks of the students' ""wonderfully unequal faculty of metempsychosis."" He reflects on his own status as an ""alien"" and his past generosity. The nursingwoman (Miss Callan) officially informs the medical officer of the birth of an heir. The delegates discuss various aspects of birth, including abnormal births, a ""plasmic memory,"" and copulation between women and ""males of brutes."" Mulligan interjects, postulating ""a nice clean old man"" as the object of desire. Stephen, asked about Siamese twins, recites the ecclesiastical ordinance against putting asunder what God has joined. Mulligan then tells a horror story: Haines, disguised as a murderer of Samuel Childs, appears from a secret panel, holding a phial of poison and a portfolio of Celtic literature. Haines confesses his crime and says his ""hell, and Ireland’s, is in this life."" He vanished with a cry ""The black panther!"" Mulligan declares the ""mystery was unveiled,"" and Haines was the third brother. Bloom's past is then reviewed, showing his youth as a ""precociously manly"" traveler and then his later life. He reflects on his one-time affair with Bridie Kelly. The ""equine portent"" grows in the sky, becoming the ""everlasting bride,"" Martha, Millicent, and the ""bride, ever virgin."" Stephen, crowned with vine leaves, says he is ""lord and giver of their life"" to the ghosts of the past. Lenehan recounts a horse race where ""Throwaway"" won, while Boylan's ""Sceptre"" lost. Bloom, observing the scene, is not mesmerized by the students. He offers a bottle of Bass to the students, pouring some out carefully. The debate continues, with Crotthers, Lynch, Costello, and Madden present. Mulligan and Bannon enter. Mulligan explains his ""Omphalos"" project. Lynch discusses women and their ""natural garment"" for a bath. The bell rings, and Miss Callan announces the birth of the baby. Dixon leaves. Bloom reflects on his ""plenitude of sufferance."" The anonymous narrator reveals that the sailor's tattoo of Antonio's face changes expression. The sailor tells a story about man-eaters and shows a postcard of savage women. Bloom realizes he is thinking of his own travel plans. The narrator (Sailor Murphy) recounts his travels and claims his wife is waiting for him. Bloom thinks of ""Enoch Arden"" and ""Rip van Winkle."" Murphy shows his discharge papers. He tells a story about a crocodile and man-eaters. Bloom sees the streetwalker again. Stephen argues against the idea of a simple substance soul. Bloom counters that a supernatural God is not necessarily proven. Stephen cites holy writ. Bloom criticizes him for reading old books. Bloom suspects Mulligan put a narcotic in Stephen's drink. He also suspects Mulligan is ""picking your brains."" Bloom sees a group of Italians arguing over money.

The whores talk about Boylan and Molly. Boylan gives a ""Godblazeqrukbrukarchkrasht!"" and Molly's voice replies with a ""Weeshwashtkissinapooisthnapoohuck?"" Bloom, agitated, cries ""Show! Hide!

Stephen, in rage, shouts ""Shite!"" and ""Non serviam!"" He smashes the chandelier. Bloom cries ""Stop!"" Stephen flees. Bella demands payment for the lamp. Bloom, seizing Stephen's ashplant, argues. He throws a shilling on the table and rushes out. Corny Kelleher arrives in a hackney car with two lechers. Bloom avoids them, hurrying away. A hue and cry of various Dubliners pursues Bloom.

**Chapter 16:**
Mr. Bloom helps the disoriented Stephen, brushing shavings from him and handing him his hat and ashplant. He suggests they go to a cabman's shelter for a drink. Bloom realizes he forgot his latchkey and the back button of his trousers is missing. They walk towards the shelter. Bloom describes his miraculous escape from a tram accident earlier. Stephen thinks of Ibsen and stonecutters. Bloom cautions Stephen about the dangers of Nighttown and ""women of ill fame,"" suggesting he needs self-defense skills. He subtly criticizes Mulligan for deserting Stephen and for ""picking your brains."" Stephen states that Mulligan is ""Judas."" They pass under the Loop Line bridge, where Stephen recognizes Gumley, a corporation watchman and his father's old friend. Bloom discretely moves away as a figure (Corley) approaches Stephen. Corley, a dissolute man, tells Stephen a sob story about being broke and deserted by friends. Stephen remembers Corley's past and offers him a job at Mr. Garrett Deasy's school. Corley declines, saying he couldn't teach. Stephen admits he has nowhere to sleep. Corley suggests a dosshouse. Stephen discovers his cash is missing, but finds halfcrowns in another pocket. He gives one to Corley. Corley asks Stephen to put in a good word for him with Boylan for a sandwichboard job, mentioning a fellow named Bags Comisky. Bloom observes Corley and his ""dilapidated hat,"" concluding he is a ""parasite."" Stephen rejoins Bloom and tells him Corley asked him to ask Boylan for a job. Bloom is evasive, mentioning his own face was familiar. He asks how much Stephen gave Corley, then questions why Stephen left his father's house. Stephen replies, ""To seek misfortune."" Bloom asks about Stephen's father, who has moved. Stephen says he's in Dublin. Bloom diplomatically suggests Stephen could go back home. Stephen, however, remembers the last time he saw his family. Bloom advises against trusting Mulligan. He suggests Mulligan might have drugged Stephen. Bloom reflects on Mulligan's versatility and rescue of a drowning man. He concludes Mulligan is ""picking your brains."" They observe a group of Italians arguing. Bloom and Stephen enter the cabman's shelter. Bloom orders coffee and a bun. He observes the ""redbearded bibulous individual"" (the sailor) who has been staring at them. Bloom comments on Italian as a ""beautiful language"" for singing. Stephen replies they were ""haggling over money."" The keeper serves them. Stephen suggests ""Sounds are impostures... like names."" Bloom agrees, mentioning his own name was changed. The sailor asks Stephen's name, and Stephen replies ""Dedalus."" The sailor recognizes the name, then boasts about Simon Dedalus's marksmanship. Bloom is struck by the coincidence. The sailor introduces himself as D.B. Murphy of Carrigaloe, Queenstown, and says his wife is waiting for him after seven years at sea. Bloom imagines Murphy's homecoming. The sailor asks for tobacco. He shows his discharge papers and describes his extensive travels, including being chased by pirates and seeing man-eaters. He shows a postcard of savage women. Bloom is reminded of his own travel plans to London and a concert tour. He reflects on the ""great opportunity"" for tourist travel and the need for new routes. He reflects on how the man in the street is ""debarred from seeing more of the world."" He thinks of various Irish and foreign attractions. The sailor describes a Chinese man with magic pills and his experience of seeing a man killed in Trieste with a knife. He claims the park murders were done by foreigners using knives. Bloom and Stephen exchange glances, knowing ""Skin-the-Goat"" (the keeper) is listening. Bloom recalls the Phoenix Park murders. The sailor asks for his papers back. Bloom asks if he's seen the Rock of Gibraltar. The sailor expresses tiredness of the sea. Bloom reflects on the ""enormous dimensions of the water."" He thinks about the ""lies a fellow told about himself"" versus what others say. He acknowledges that ""Analogous scenes are occasionally... met with."" He talks about Aztecs. He links the sailor's ""stab in the back"" story to Italians, noting their passion. He then links this to Molly's Spanish background. Stephen interjects that the ""temperaments at the door"" were arguing over money. Bloom agrees. Stephen speaks of Dante and isosceles triangles. Bloom connects it to ""blood and the sun"" and his visit to the museum, where he admired Greek statues. He dislikes ""rumpled stockings."" The others discuss accidents at sea. The sailor claims a pious medal saved him. They discuss the wreck of the ""Palme"" off Daunt's rock. The sailor leaves his seat to urinate outside. Bloom observes him drinking rum and easing himself, waking a horse. The corporation watchman, Gumley, shifts in his box. Bloom reflects on Gumley's downfall. They lament the decline of Irish shipping. The keeper claims ""wrecks and wreckers"" are common and asks if the British government paid Captain John Lever to wreck a ship in Galway Bay. The sailor returns, singing a chanty about ""Johnny Lever."" The keeper blames England for draining Ireland's resources. The sailor says the Irish are the ""best troops in the army."" The keeper cares nothing for any empire. Bloom dismisses the claims, believing the English ""concealed their strength."" He notes that Irish soldiers fought for England as often as against her. He sees the scene as a ""confidence trick."" He decides that it's better to avoid such ""careers of wrongdoing."" He admires the courage of men who brandish knives. He tells Stephen that he silenced a man who called him a Jew by saying ""his God, I mean Christ, was a jew too and all his family like me though in reality I’m not."" Stephen mumbles a Latin phrase. Bloom emphasizes mutual equality and his dislike of violence. He discreetly tells Stephen that Jews are accused of ruining countries, but that history proves the opposite. He advocates for every Irishman having a ""comfortable tidysized income."" Stephen, staring, states, ""Count me out,"" meaning work. Bloom clarifies he means ""work in the widest possible sense."" Stephen retorts, ""Ireland must be important because it belongs to me."" Bloom, unable to interpret, drops the subject. He thinks about O'Callaghan, a ""half crazy faddist"" who wore a suit of brown paper. He considers writing about ""My Experiences... in a Cabman’s Shelter."" He reads the newspaper, noting the ""L. Boom"" misprint of his name. He is also surprised by ""Throwaway"" winning the Gold Cup. He notes the ""Return of Parnell"" article. Bloom is surprised by the others' memories of Parnell. He speculates on Parnell's death. He reflects on the ""idol with feet of clay."" The proprietor disparages Parnell's wife. Campbell praises her. Skin-the-Goat makes a coarse joke. Bloom thinks about the ""historic story"" of Parnell's affair. He concludes that the husband was ""not up to the scratch."" He thinks about the ""eternal question of the life connubial."" He tells Stephen that ""blood and the sun"" explain everything. Stephen gives a muddled answer. Bloom shows Stephen a faded photo of Molly, in an evening dress, low cut. Bloom calls her ""Mrs Bloom, my wife the prima donna Madam Marion Tweedy."" He describes her beauty. He thinks about leaving the photo for Stephen to admire. He reflects on the ""makebelieve"" in marriage and the ""sensational extent"" of the Parnell scandal. He compares his minor injury at a Parnell rally to the ""mud-slinging"" surrounding Parnell. He thinks about how women incite men. He reflects on the need for Stephen to find a ""Miss Right."" He asks Stephen when he dined, and Stephen replies ""The day before yesterday."" Bloom reflects on their shared thoughts. He decides it is time to go. He offers Stephen to come home for cocoa and a shakedown, believing Stephen will be safe and warm. He thinks about the ""grasswidower"" sailor and the ""most vulnerable point"" of Achilles. He pays the fourpence for their drinks. He and Stephen leave the shelter. Bloom explains that tables are turned upside down to ""sweep the floor in the morning."" They walk arm in arm. Bloom tells Stephen that Molly ""would have the greatest of pleasure in making your acquaintance as she is passionately attached to music of any kind."" Stephen describes variations on an air by Sweelinck. Bloom suggests Stephen could have a successful singing career. He plans to advise Stephen to break ties with Mulligan. The horse pulling a sweeper stops and mired three globes of turds. Bloom and Stephen pass through the chains, and walk towards Gardiner Street. Stephen sings the end of the ballad. The driver watches them walk away.

**Chapter 17:**
Bloom and Stephen walk together from Beresford Place towards Bloom's home at 7 Eccles Street. They discuss music, literature, Ireland, women, prostitution, diet, the Roman Catholic Church, celibacy, jesuit education, and Stephen's collapse. They find common factors: sensitivity to art, preference for continental life, and disbelief in orthodox doctrines. They differ on diet and civic self-help (Bloom) versus the eternal affirmation of the spirit (Stephen). Bloom covertly agrees with Stephen's correction of an historical anachronism. Stephen attributes his collapse to a ""matutinal cloud,"" while Bloom blames gastric issues. They both agree on the neutral influence of gaslight on trees. Bloom recalls past nocturnal conversations about similar topics, from 1884 to 1893. He notes that ""progressive extension of the field of individual development and experience was regressively accompanied by a restriction of the converse domain of interindividual relations."" They arrive at 7 Eccles Street. Bloom realizes he forgot his latchkey in another pair of trousers. He climbs over the area railings, falls, but is uninjured. He enters through the scullery, lights gas and a candle. Stephen, waiting outside, sees these actions. Stephen enters softly, following Bloom to the kitchen. Bloom extinguishes the candle and builds a fire. Stephen thinks of others who kindled fires for him, including his father and mother. Stephen observes handkerchiefs and stockings hanging to dry on a rope. Bloom sees a saucepan and kettle on the range. He gets water from the tap, reflecting on water's universality and qualities, the drought, and the city's water supply problems. He washes his hands with lemon soap. Stephen declines a bath, calling himself ""hydrophobe."" Bloom represses hygiene advice. Bloom notes Stephen's confidence and power. The kettle boils. Bloom considers shaving. He reflects on the ""surety of the sense of touch"" in his hand and his reluctance to shed human blood. Bloom opens the kitchen dresser, revealing various items, including coins, olives, Plumtree's potted meat, cocoa, tea, sugar, milk, and ribsteak. He notices two lacerated scarlet betting tickets. He recalls the Gold Cup horse race result from the ""Evening Telegraph,"" and earlier intimations of the result in pubs and from Elijah's throwaway. He considers the difficulties of interpretation and counterestimating losses. He is satisfied at having sustained ""no positive loss"" and brought ""positive gain to others."" He prepares cocoa for Stephen and himself, serving Stephen the cream usually reserved for Molly. Stephen accepts the cocoa. Bloom considers mending Stephen's jacket and giving him a handkerchief. Bloom drinks his cocoa faster. He reflects on the pleasures of literature and his own youthful poem. He identifies four ""separating forces"" between them: name, age, race, creed. He recalls anagrams of his name and an acrostic he sent Molly. He lists reasons he couldn't complete a topical song, including the Queen's Jubilee, the new fish market, theater competition, Nelly Bouverist's underclothing, and rhymes. Their ages are compared, showing a widening disparity. These calculations are subject to the ""cessation of existence"" or ""annihilation of the world."" He recalls two previous encounters with Stephen, one in 1887 and one in 1892. Bloom declines Stephen's dinner invitation. A third link is revealed: Mrs. Riordan (Dante), who stayed with Stephen's parents and later with Bloom at the City Arms Hotel. Bloom sometimes pushed her in her bathchair. Bloom justifies his equanimity by thinking of his own youth. He meditates on schemes for wealth through various inventions and land reclamation. He lists several Irish and foreign places. He imagines himself as a gentleman farmer, magistrate, and the owner of ""Bloom Cottage."" He outlines a civic role for himself. He proves his rectitude from youth, citing his conversion, his advocacy for political theories, and his presence at a torchlight procession. He calculates how he would pay for his country residence. He considers ""rapid but insecure means to opulence,"" like a wireless telegraph to transmit race results, finding treasure, or a Spanish prisoner's donation. He also considers industrial channels like waste reclamation and hydroelectric power. He meditates on these schemes to alleviate fatigue. He fears committing homicide or suicide during sleep. His final meditations are on a unique advertisement. He unlocks a drawer, revealing Milly's copybook with diagrams, photographs of Queen Alexandra and Maud Branscombe, a Yuletide card, sealing wax, pennibs, a sandglass, a sealed prophecy, a bazaar ticket, a letter from Milly, a cameo brooch and scarfpin, Martha Clifford's letters, a cryptogram, a press cutting on corporal punishment, a pink ribbon, rubber preservatives, envelopes, Austro-Hungarian coins, lottery coupons, a magnifying glass, erotic photocards, a recipe, a stamp, a chart of his body measurements, and a prospectus for a rectal remedy addressed (erroneously) to Mrs. L. Bloom. He adds a fourth letter from Martha Clifford to this collection. He reflects on his magnetic appeal to women. The second drawer contains Bloom's birth certificate, an endowment assurance policy (naming Milly), a bank passbook, a certificate of stock, cemetery dockets, and his father's deedpoll changing his name from Virag to Bloom. Other objects include a daguerreotype of Rudolf and Leopold Virag, a haggadah book, a photocard of the Queen's Hotel in Ennis (his father's), and an envelope addressed ""To My Dear Son Leopold."" These evoke memories of his father's melancholia and suicide. Bloom feels remorse for disrespecting certain Jewish beliefs. He recalls his father narrating migrations. He notes his father's eccentricities in old age. He finds consolation in his financial documents. He imagines a hypothetical descent into mendicancy and destitution. He considers departure desirable due to cohabitation issues and the attractive character of various localities. He ponders the signs for navigation. He imagines a public advertisement for his disappearance. He considers ""Everyman or Noman"" as his binomial denomination. He thinks of himself as a wanderer, eventually returning as an ""estranged avenger."" He considers what would make his return irrational. He then re-enters his house, his head hitting a timber angle. He notices the furniture has been rearranged (by Molly for Boylan). He sees a sofa, a majolica table, and a piano with ""Love's Old Sweet Song"" open. He places an incense cone in the candlestick, which emits ""aromatic oriental incense."" He observes other objects on the mantelpiece: a stopped clock, a dwarf tree, and an embalmed owl. He sees his own ""solitary... mutable... man"" image in the mirror, reflecting his resemblance to his parents. He sees his books inverted on the shelves. He reflects on the need for order. He removes his collar and unbuttons his clothes. He touches a bee sting scar and extracts a shilling from his waistcoat pocket. He compiles his budget for the day. He removes his boots and socks, picks at a toenail, and inhales its odor with satisfaction, recalling childhood habits. His ultimate ambition is to purchase a thatched bungalow, ""Bloom Cottage,"" with various amenities. He envisions himself as a gentleman farmer and a resident magistrate. He outlines a course of action based on justice. He recalls his early rectitude and political involvement. He calculates the cost of the residence and various means to acquire wealth. He considers projects like the reclamation of land and the exploitation of hydroelectric power. He justifies his meditations as a way to alleviate fatigue. He fears homicide or suicide during sleep. His final meditations are on a unique advertisement. He inventories the contents of his first and second drawers, filled with personal documents and mementos. He reflects on his father's suicide and his own past. He contemplates the cycles of life and death, concluding that human life is infinitely perfectible in some ways, but limited by ""generic conditions."" Stephen affirms his significance as a ""conscious rational animal."" Bloom apprehends this substantially. They stand at the kitchen door, Stephen with his hat, Bloom with a candle. A cat enters. They emerge into the garden, observing the stars. Bloom meditates on cosmic evolution and involution. He finds the problems of inhabitability of planets and redemption ""of a different order of difficulty."" He considers various features of constellations and their influence. His logical conclusion is that it was ""not a heaventree, not a heavengrot."" He accepts the aesthetic value of the spectacle. He considers astrological influences. He notes the ""special affinities"" between the moon and woman. They see a lamp shining in Molly's bedroom window. Bloom tries to explain the mystery of his wife, denoted by the lamp. They then urinate together in the garden, with their backs to each other. They observe a shooting star. Bloom inserts a key into the lock to unlock the door. They take leave of each other at the door. They hear the church bells. Bloom reflects on his defunct companions. He sees the daybreak. He returns indoors, accidentally hitting his head on a sideboard in the rearranged parlor. He examines the piano, the flowers, the ashtray, and the music for ""Love's Old Sweet Song"" open on the piano. He then sits down, extracts a cone of incense, lights it, and it emits ""aromatic oriental incense."" He looks at the clock stopped at 4:46 a.m. in 1896. He looks at an embalmed owl and a dwarf tree. He sees his own ""solitary... mutable... man"" reflection in the mirror, and the inverted books on the shelves. He puts away his clothes, noting the damage to his sock. He removes his boots and socks, picks his toenail, and inhales its odor with satisfaction. His ultimate ambition is to buy a specific country residence. He envisions himself as a successful, respected gentleman farmer. He contemplates the ways to acquire wealth. He justifies his meditations for sleep. He fears murder or suicide. His final thoughts are on a perfect advertisement. He catalogues the contents of his drawers, including letters, photos, and personal items. He adds a fourth letter from Martha Clifford. He reflects on his attraction to women. He lists his financial documents and his father's name change. He recalls his father's melancholia and suicide, feeling remorse for past disrespect of beliefs. He thinks about his father's migrations and habits. He reflects on his hypothetical descent into poverty. He considers departure from Dublin. He lists attractive places in Ireland and abroad. He considers navigation signs. He imagines an advertisement for his disappearance. He accepts ""Everyman or Noman"" as his name. He foresees himself wandering, then returning as an ""estranged avenger."" He questions the rationality of such a return. He considers the inertia of staying. He thinks about the advantages of an occupied bed. He recapitulates the day's events, from breakfast to Nighttown, as a series of ""rites."" He wonders about the ""brief sharp unforeseen heard loud lone crack"" he heard. He wonders ""Who was M'Intosh?"" He finally comprehends ""Where was Moses when the candle went out?"" He silently enumerates the day's ""imperfections."" He recalls his father's face. He sees Molly's clothes, including new hose, violet garters, and large drawers, on a trunk. He removes his remaining clothes and gets into bed. He encounters ""new clean bedlinen, additional odours, the presence of a human form, female, hers, the imprint of a human form, male, not his, some crumbs, some flakes of potted meat."" He smiles, reflecting that everyone imagines himself first, but is always last in an infinite series. He lists Molly's past lovers. He reflects on Boylan's vigor and impressionability. He feels envy and jealousy, but also abnegation and equanimity. He justifies his sentiments by considering the ""preordained frangibility of the hymen"" and grammatical transitions. These reflections converge on ""Satisfaction at the ubiquity... of adipose anterior and posterior female hemispheres."" He experiences ""an approximate erection"" and kisses Molly's rump. This is followed by ""silent contemplation"" and ""proximate erection."" He then narrates parts of his day to Molly, omitting Martha, the pub brawl, and Gerty, but including Leah, supper at Wynn's, and the ""Sweets of Sin"" book, and Stephen's collapse. He notes the limitations of their conjugal rights and mental intercourse since Milly's puberty. He identifies the ""upcast reflection of a lamp"" moving above their thoughts. They lie at an angle of 45 degrees. He is ""the childman weary, the manchild in the womb."" He thinks of a long list of sailors. He then falls asleep, hearing a clock cooing ""Cuckoo.""

**Chapter 18:**
Molly Bloom begins a long, unpunctuated internal monologue, reflecting on her life, primarily her sexual and emotional experiences. She thinks about Bloom's unusual request for breakfast in bed and his past pretensions with Mrs. Riordan. She dismisses his intelligence, contrasting him with more attractive men. She recalls his recent secretive letter-writing, suspecting an affair. She speculates on her own desirability and the possibility of taking a young lover. She remembers her past sexual encounters, particularly with Lieutenant Mulvey in Gibraltar, which was her first kiss. She thinks of her current affair with Blazes Boylan, recalling his recent visit and their intimacy. She acknowledges her own body, her physical desires, and her disdain for modesty. She thinks about her daughter Milly, now grown up, and the difficulty of motherhood. She reflects on the hypocrisy of men and society's expectations of women. She recalls past rows with Bloom, including one about politics where he made her cry, and another about a dancing master. She thinks about Bloom's odd habits and his tendency to be unlucky. She considers her own singing talent and how it has been underutilized. She remembers her first real kiss and the excitement it caused. She ponders her own age and attractiveness, comparing herself to other women. She thinks about Bloom's attempts to make money and his various schemes, which she largely dismisses as foolish. She recalls her father, Major Tweedy, and his military career in Gibraltar. She thinks about the clothes she wears and her dissatisfaction with her current wardrobe. She remembers dancing with Boylan and the physical sensation of his touch. She continues to reflect on her sexual desires and fantasies, wishing for a man to ""take me sometime when hes there and kiss me in his arms."" She thinks about her confession to Father Corrigan and her lack of true remorse. She remembers her experiences with men in Gibraltar and elsewhere, noting their aggressive pursuit of women. She thinks about her weight and her body. She recalls Bloom's compliments and his ""gentle"" nature, but also his perceived lack of passion. She contrasts herself with other women, believing she has more character and understanding of men. She thinks about the limitations imposed on women and her own desire for freedom. She remembers Bloom's proposal on Howth Head, and her ""yes"" that sealed their fate. She thinks about her own sensuality and the beauty of nature. She ends her monologue with a powerful, repeated affirmation of ""yes,"" embracing life, love, and her own desires."
