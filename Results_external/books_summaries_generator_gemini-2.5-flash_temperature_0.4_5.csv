A Doll_s House-Henrik Ibsen,"The play opens on Christmas Eve in the Helmer household. Nora Helmer, in high spirits, returns home with Christmas parcels. Her husband, Torvald Helmer, a newly appointed bank manager, playfully scolds her for being a ""spendthrift"" and reminds her of his strict stance against debt and borrowing. He gives her money for Christmas, and she shows him the children's presents. Nora hints at wanting money for herself, which Torvald dismisses as her usual extravagance, though he admits she saves what she can. He also notices her looking uneasy and teases her about eating forbidden macaroons. Torvald expresses his delight at their improved financial situation and his new position, which will bring a large salary. He mentions that Doctor Rank, a close family friend, will be joining them for dinner.

A visitor arrives, Mrs. Linde, an old school friend of Nora's. Nora is overjoyed but notes how much Christine (Mrs. Linde) has changed. Christine reveals she is a widow, childless, and has been struggling financially, working tirelessly for years to support her bedridden mother and younger brothers, who are now independent. She feels her life is ""unspeakably empty"" and has come to town seeking regular office work. Nora, in turn, excitedly shares her good fortune, revealing Torvald's new bank manager position. She then confides a secret to Christine: it was she, not her father, who obtained the money (two hundred and fifty pounds) for Torvald's life-saving trip to Italy years ago when he was gravely ill. She explains that Torvald's pride would have been hurt if he knew, and her father was too ill to sign the bond. She has been secretly paying off the debt through various means, including copying work, and has found it a great burden. She hopes to be free of it soon.

Just then, Krogstad, a lawyer who works at Torvald's bank, arrives to speak with Torvald. Mrs. Linde is visibly startled, recognizing him from her past. Doctor Rank, who was with Torvald, emerges from the study and describes Krogstad as a man with a ""diseased moral character"" who was guilty of an ""indiscretion"" (forgery) in the past. Nora, realizing Krogstad's connection to her secret, offers Mrs. Linde a position at the bank through Torvald's influence.

Krogstad confronts Nora, revealing he knows about her loan and the forgery of her father's signature on the bond, which he possesses. He points out that her father's signature was dated three days after his death, implying Nora forged the date. Nora admits she forged her father's signature because he was too ill to sign and she couldn't tell him about Torvald's life-threatening condition. Krogstad threatens to expose her if Torvald dismisses him from the bank, stating that her ""one false step"" is similar to his own ""indiscretion"" that ruined his reputation. He wants to keep his job and regain his respectability for his sons' sake. Nora dismisses his threats, believing her motives (love for her husband) justify her actions and that her husband would pay off the debt. However, Krogstad warns her that if he loses his position, she will lose hers with him. After Krogstad leaves, Nora is deeply troubled, whispering that it's ""impossible"" and she did it ""for love's sake."" Torvald returns, and Nora lies about Krogstad's visit. Torvald reveals he has the authority to make changes at the bank and plans to dismiss Krogstad, whom he despises for his moral failings and overly familiar manner. He tells Nora that such a ""guilty man"" poisons his home with lies, and that a ""deceitful mother"" infects her children. Nora is horrified by this statement and tries to dissuade him from dismissing Krogstad, but Torvald sends the dismissal letter anyway. Nora is terrified, realizing the letter's implications. Torvald, unaware of her secret, assures her he is man enough to take everything upon himself if anything should happen.

Act II opens with Nora's increasing anxiety. The Christmas tree is dishevelled, reflecting her inner turmoil. She checks the letterbox, hoping Krogstad's letter isn't there. She talks to the Nurse, asking if children forget their mothers if they go away, hinting at desperate thoughts. Mrs. Linde arrives to help Nora mend her Tarantella dress for the upcoming fancy-dress ball. Nora reveals to Christine that Doctor Rank is suffering from a dangerous, hereditary spinal disease, a consequence of his father's excesses.

Doctor Rank then visits, and after some conversation, confesses his love for Nora, stating he would gladly give his life for her. Nora is shocked and distressed by his confession, as she had considered asking him for a large sum of money to pay off Krogstad, but now realizes she cannot exploit his feelings. Rank tells her he will send her a card with a black cross on it when his final decline begins, indicating he will shut himself away to die and does not want Torvald to see him in his sickroom.

Krogstad returns, having received his dismissal letter. He confirms that Torvald knows nothing of Nora's forgery. He tells Nora he will not expose her to the law, but demands to be reinstated at the bank in a higher position, as Torvald's ""right hand."" He then drops a letter into the Helmers' letterbox, which reveals Nora's secret to Torvald. Nora is frantic, knowing Torvald will soon read it. She desperately tries to distract Torvald from checking the letterbox, begging him to help her practice her Tarantella dance and promising him she will only think of him. She insists he must not open any letters until after the ball. Mrs. Linde, seeing the letter in the box, realizes the full extent of Nora's predicament and offers to speak to Krogstad, revealing that they have a past relationship and she believes she can influence him. She leaves to find Krogstad, while Nora continues her desperate dance, feeling her life depends on it.

In Act III, Mrs. Linde waits for Krogstad at the Helmers' house after the ball. She reveals that she broke off their relationship years ago to marry a wealthier man and support her family, but now that her obligations are fulfilled and she is a widow, she feels her life is empty. She proposes to Krogstad that they reunite, offering to care for him and his children, and to work together. Krogstad is overjoyed and wants to retrieve his letter from Torvald's letterbox to spare Nora. However, Mrs. Linde stops him, believing that the ""unhappy secret must be disclosed"" to force a ""complete understanding"" between Nora and Torvald, as their marriage cannot continue with ""concealment and falsehood."" Krogstad agrees to leave the letter.

Torvald and Nora return from the ball. Torvald is pleased with Nora's dancing, but also controlling and possessive. Doctor Rank makes a brief, final visit. He confirms his illness has progressed to ""absolute certainty"" and says he will be ""invisible"" at the next ball, implying his death. He leaves two cards with black crosses on them in the letterbox. After Rank leaves, Torvald checks the letterbox, finds Rank's cards, and understands his friend's impending death. He then finds Krogstad's letter.

Reading Krogstad's letter, Torvald is enraged. He calls Nora a ""hypocrite, a liar—worse, worse—a criminal!"" He blames her father's lack of principle for her actions and declares she has destroyed his happiness and ruined his future, fearing public scandal and suspicion of his own involvement. He states that for the sake of appearances, Nora must remain in the house, but he will not allow her to raise the children.

Just then, the maid brings another letter for Nora. Torvald seizes it and reads it. It is from Krogstad, stating that a ""happy change in his life"" has occurred, and he is returning Nora's bond, effectively retracting his threat. Torvald is overcome with relief, shouting that they are both ""saved!"" He immediately tears up the bond and both letters, burning them in the stove, and declares the whole affair a bad dream. He ""forgives"" Nora, calling her his ""frightened little singing-bird"" and attributing her actions to ""womanly helplessness"" and lack of understanding. He asserts that he has given her ""a new life"" and that she has become ""both wife and child"" to him.

Nora, however, has undergone a profound change. She calmly changes into her everyday dress and asks Torvald to sit down for a serious conversation, the first they have ever had in eight years of marriage. She tells him she has never been happy, only ""merry,"" and that their home has been a ""playroom"" where she was his ""doll-wife,"" just as she was her father's ""doll-child."" She accuses him and her father of committing a ""great sin"" against her by preventing her from making anything of her life. She declares she is no longer a suitable wife for him and must leave to educate herself and understand the world and her own identity.

Torvald is shocked and tries to forbid her, reminding her of her ""most sacred duties"" as a wife and mother. Nora counters that she has ""other duties just as sacred""—duties to herself. She no longer believes that she is primarily a wife and mother, but a ""reasonable human being"" who must think for herself. She questions the laws and religious principles that would condemn her for saving her father and husband. She reveals that she had hoped for a ""wonderful thing"" when Krogstad's letter came: that Torvald would bravely take all the blame upon himself. When he instead reacted with anger and fear for his own reputation, she realized he was not the man she thought he was, and she no longer loves him. She states that no man would sacrifice his honor for love, but ""hundreds of thousands of women have.""

Nora concludes that she cannot live with him as she is now, nor can she live with a ""strange man."" She returns her wedding ring, asks for his, and declares herself free from all obligations to him, and him from hers. She states she will not see the children, believing they are in better hands. She refuses any contact or help from Torvald, as he is a ""stranger"" to her. She leaves the house, stating that for their life together to be a ""real wedlock,"" both would have to be so changed that she no longer believes in ""wonderful things happening."" Torvald is left alone, calling her name, as the sound of a door shutting is heard from below."
Alice_s Adventures in Wonderland-Lewis Carroll,"Alice, growing tired of sitting idly by her sister on a riverbank, notices a White Rabbit with pink eyes run by, muttering ""Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!"" The Rabbit then takes a watch from its waistcoat-pocket and hurries on, sparking Alice's curiosity. She follows it down a large rabbit-hole, falling into a very deep well lined with cupboards and bookshelves. During her slow descent, she places an empty ""ORANGE MARMALADE"" jar into a cupboard. She muses about her location, her cat Dinah, and dozes off.

She lands unhurt on a pile of sticks and leaves and sees the White Rabbit again, still hurrying. She follows it into a long, low hall with many locked doors. On a glass table, she finds a tiny golden key, which fits a small door about fifteen inches high behind a curtain. Through this door, she sees a beautiful garden but cannot fit. She wishes she could shrink. She then finds a bottle labeled ""DRINK ME."" After checking it's not poison, she drinks the contents, which taste like a mixture of various foods, and shrinks to ten inches tall. However, she realizes she left the key on the table and cannot reach it.

Frustrated, Alice scolds herself. She then finds a small cake under the table marked ""EAT ME."" She eats it, hoping to change size, and after eating the whole cake, she begins to grow. She grows so large that her head hits the roof of the hall, making her over nine feet tall. She manages to grab the key but can only look into the garden with one eye while lying down. Overwhelmed, she cries a pool of tears around her.

The White Rabbit returns, dressed splendidly, looking for his fan and gloves. Alice tries to ask for help, but the Rabbit, startled, drops his items and flees. Alice picks up the fan and gloves and, fanning herself, realizes she is shrinking again. She quickly drops the fan, stopping her rapid decrease in size, and is now about two feet high. However, the door is still locked, and the key is on the unreachable table. Suddenly, she slips and falls into the pool of tears she had wept, now swimming in salt water.

She encounters a Mouse in the pool and attempts to speak to it, first in a formal style, then in French. The Mouse is terrified by the mention of ""cat"" (chatte). Alice apologizes but then describes her own cat, Dinah, and her mouse-catching skills, further offending the Mouse. She then tries to talk about dogs, which also offends the Mouse. She calls it back, promising not to mention cats or dogs. The Mouse agrees to tell its history once they reach shore. Other creatures, including a Duck, a Dodo, a Lory, and an Eaglet, have also fallen into the pool, and they all swim to the bank.

On the bank, the wet creatures discuss how to get dry. The Mouse, taking charge, begins to recite a ""dry"" history lesson about William the Conqueror, but it doesn't help them dry. The Dodo proposes a ""Caucus-race,"" which involves running in a circle with no clear start or end, until everyone is dry. After about half an hour, the Dodo declares everyone has won and must have prizes. Alice, designated as the prize-giver, distributes comfits from her pocket. For her own prize, she offers a thimble, which the Dodo solemnly presents back to her.

The Mouse then begins to tell its ""long and a sad tale,"" which Alice misinterprets as referring to the literal length of its tail. The Mouse recites a poem about a trial between Fury and a mouse, but Alice's preoccupation with the tail offends the Mouse, who accuses her of not paying attention and confusing words. The Mouse, insulted, walks away. Alice, trying to call it back, mentions her cat Dinah's ability to fetch things and catch birds. This causes all the birds present to flee in fear, leaving Alice alone and regretful.

The White Rabbit reappears, still searching for his fan and gloves and muttering about the Duchess. He mistakes Alice for his housemaid, Mary Ann, and orders her to fetch them from his house. Alice, frightened, goes to the Rabbit's house. Inside, she finds a bottle and drinks from it, hoping to grow to her normal size. Instead, she grows so large that she fills the house, with one arm out a window and one foot up the chimney. The Rabbit and other creatures (including Pat and Bill the Lizard) try to get her out, first by attempting to open the door, then by trying to remove her arm from the window, and finally by sending Bill down the chimney. Alice kicks Bill out of the chimney. The Rabbit suggests burning the house down, but Alice threatens to set Dinah on them, causing a silence. They then throw pebbles at the window, which turn into little cakes. Alice eats one, shrinks, and escapes the house, running into a wood.

In the wood, Alice encounters an enormous puppy, which she plays with using a stick before escaping. She realizes she needs to grow to her proper size and finds a large mushroom. On top of it, a large blue Caterpillar is smoking a hookah. The Caterpillar repeatedly asks Alice ""Who are _you_?"", to which Alice replies she doesn't know, having changed so many times. She tries to recite a poem, ""You are old, Father William,"" but it comes out wrong. The Caterpillar, exactly three inches high, is offended when Alice says three inches is a ""wretched height."" The Caterpillar then crawls away, telling Alice that one side of the mushroom will make her grow taller and the other shorter. Alice breaks off a piece from each side. She nibbles one piece and shrinks rapidly, her chin hitting her foot. She then eats from the other piece, and her neck grows immensely long, rising above the treetops. A Pigeon mistakes her for a serpent, complaining about serpents eating eggs. Alice eventually manages to return to her normal height by carefully eating from both mushroom pieces. She then sees a small house and shrinks herself to nine inches tall before approaching it.

At the house, Alice observes a Fish-Footman and a Frog-Footman. The Fish-Footman delivers an invitation from the Queen to the Duchess to play croquet. Alice tries to enter but the Frog-Footman gives nonsensical reasons why knocking is useless. Alice, frustrated, opens the door and enters a smoky kitchen. Inside, the Duchess is nursing a constantly sneezing and howling baby, while a Cook throws kitchenware at them. A grinning Cheshire Cat sits by the fire. Alice asks the Duchess why her cat grins, learning it's a Cheshire cat. The Duchess sings a violent lullaby to the baby, shaking it with each line. She then flings the baby at Alice, telling her to nurse it, and leaves for the croquet game. Alice struggles to hold the oddly shaped baby, which she realizes is turning into a pig. She sets the pig down, and it trots into the wood.

Alice then encounters the Cheshire Cat again. She asks for directions, and the Cat tells her that a Hatter and a March Hare live nearby, both of whom are mad. The Cat explains that everyone there is mad, including Alice. The Cat vanishes and reappears several times, leaving only its grin behind at one point. Alice proceeds to the March Hare's house, shrinking herself slightly before entering.

She finds the March Hare and the Hatter having a perpetual tea-party with a sleeping Dormouse, whom they use as a cushion. They tell Alice there's ""No room!"" but she sits down anyway. They offer her wine, but there is none. The Hatter makes a personal remark about her hair, then asks the riddle ""Why is a raven like a writing-desk?"" which he and the March Hare admit they don't know the answer to. The Hatter checks his watch, which tells the day of the month but not the time, and complains about butter in its works. He explains that he and ""Time"" had a quarrel, so it's always six o'clock (tea-time) for them, which is why they keep moving around the table for clean cups. The Dormouse tells a story about three sisters who lived in a ""treacle-well"" and drew ""treacle"" and things beginning with ""M."" Alice finds the conversation increasingly nonsensical and rude. Disgusted, she leaves, vowing never to return. She then finds a door in a tree that leads back to the long hall. Using the golden key and the mushroom, she finally enters the beautiful garden.

In the garden, Alice sees three card-shaped gardeners painting white roses red, fearing the Queen of Hearts will behead them for planting the wrong color. The Queen arrives with a grand procession of card-soldiers, courtiers, royal children, and the White Rabbit, followed by the Knave of Hearts and the King and Queen of Hearts. The Queen, upon seeing Alice standing, demands to know her name and who the prostrate gardeners are. Alice, feeling bold, says it's ""no business of _mine_."" The Queen furiously screams ""Off with her head!"" but Alice dismisses it as ""Nonsense!"" The King intervenes. The Queen orders the gardeners' heads off, but Alice hides them in a flower-pot.

The Queen invites Alice to play croquet. The game is chaotic: the ground is uneven, the balls are live hedgehogs, the mallets are live flamingoes, and the arches are soldiers who keep moving. The Queen constantly shouts ""Off with his head!"" or ""Off with her head!"" Alice sees the Cheshire Cat's grin appear in the air. She complains to the Cat about the unfair game. The King orders the Cat's head removed, but the executioner, King, and Queen argue about how to behead a head without a body. Alice suggests asking the Duchess, who is in prison. The Cat's head fades away as the executioner goes to fetch the Duchess.

The Duchess, now in a pleasant mood, links arms with Alice, offering convoluted morals for everything. The Queen reappears and, with a threat of execution, makes the Duchess vanish. The Queen continues ordering executions during the croquet game, until only she, the King, and Alice remain free. The Queen then sends Alice and the Gryphon to hear the Mock Turtle's story. The Gryphon reveals that the Queen never actually executes anyone.

They find the Mock Turtle, who is sighing and appears sad. He tells Alice his history, beginning with ""Once, I was a real Turtle."" He describes going to school in the sea, learning ""Reeling and Writhing,"" and ""Arithmetic—Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, and Derision,"" as well as ""Mystery, ancient and modern, with Seaography,"" and ""Drawling, Stretching, and Fainting in Coils."" He explains that lessons ""lessen"" each day. The Gryphon then asks him to describe the ""Lobster Quadrille,"" a dance involving lobsters as partners, throwing them out to sea, and turning somersaults. The Mock Turtle sings a song about a whiting and a snail. The Gryphon explains that whitings have their tails in their mouths because they were thrown out to sea for dancing with lobsters, and that ""whiting"" also refers to what makes boots shiny, which are made of ""Soles and eels.""

The Gryphon then asks Alice to tell her adventures. She recounts her experiences, including her incorrect recitation of ""You are old, Father William."" The Mock Turtle and Gryphon then make Alice recite ""'_’Tis the voice of the sluggard_,'"" which she also gets wrong, singing about a lobster. She is interrupted as a cry of ""The trial’s beginning!"" is heard.

Alice and the Gryphon hurry to the trial, where the King and Queen of Hearts are on their throne. The Knave of Hearts is in chains, accused of stealing the Queen's tarts. The White Rabbit acts as Herald. Alice observes the King as judge and twelve creatures as jurors, who are busy writing on slates. Alice takes away Bill the Lizard's squeaking pencil. The White Rabbit reads the accusation in verse. The Hatter is called as the first witness, giving nervous and nonsensical testimony about tea and dates, which confuse the court. Alice begins to grow again, causing the Dormouse to complain and move. The King threatens the Hatter with execution. The Hatter is dismissed, and the Queen orders his head off, but he escapes. The Duchess's Cook is the next witness but refuses to cooperate, only saying tarts are made of ""Pepper, mostly."" The Dormouse interjects ""Treacle,"" causing the Queen to order its suppression and removal. During the confusion, the Cook disappears. Finally, the White Rabbit calls Alice as the next witness.

Alice, forgetting her size, jumps up and knocks over the jury-box, scattering the jurymen. She quickly puts them back, including Bill the Lizard, who she initially placed upside down. The King asks Alice what she knows about the stolen tarts, and she replies ""Nothing."" The King declares this ""very important,"" but the White Rabbit corrects him, saying he meant ""unimportant."" The King then reads ""Rule Forty-two: _All persons more than a mile high to leave the court_."" Alice, now very large, refuses to leave, pointing out the King just invented the rule. The King tries to get the jury to consider their verdict, but the White Rabbit produces a new piece of evidence: a letter, which turns out to be a set of nonsensical verses, found on the Knave. The King tries to interpret the verses as proof of the Knave's guilt, making strained connections to swimming and ""fits."" Alice loudly declares there's no meaning in the verses. The Queen, furious, demands ""Sentence first—verdict afterwards."" Alice calls this ""Stuff and nonsense!"" The Queen screams ""Off with her head!""

At this, Alice, now grown to her full size, declares, ""Who cares for you? You’re nothing but a pack of cards!"" The entire pack of cards flies up and then down upon her. Alice screams and tries to bat them away, only to find herself lying on the riverbank, her head in her sister's lap. Her sister wakes her, and Alice recounts her ""curious dream."" Her sister, after hearing the story, imagines Alice's dream herself, with all the strange creatures and events, before picturing Alice as a grown woman, sharing these wonderful tales with other children."
Anna Karenina-Leo Tolstoy,"The plot of the provided text, ""Anna Karenina,"" unfolds across eight parts, detailing the intertwined lives and emotional struggles of several characters, primarily focusing on the Oblonsky and Levin families, and the developing relationship between Anna Karenina and Count Vronsky.

**PART ONE**

The story begins in the Oblonskys' house, where chaos reigns after Darya Alexandrovna (Dolly) discovers her husband, Prince Stepan Arkadyevitch Oblonsky (Stiva), has been having an affair with their French governess. Dolly announces she can no longer live with him, causing distress throughout the household. Stiva, while regretting his lack of discretion, does not truly repent his infidelity. His valet, Matvey, informs him that his sister, Anna Arkadyevna Karenina, is arriving from Petersburg, hinting that she might help reconcile the couple. Dolly, however, tells Matvey she is leaving. The nurse, Matrona Philimonovna, urges Stiva to beg Dolly's forgiveness for the children's sake.

Stiva, despite his inner turmoil, maintains a cheerful exterior. He attends to some office work and a petitioner, then decides to confront Dolly. He finds her distraught, sorting her belongings, contemplating leaving but unable to due to her love for him and the practicalities of caring for their five children. Stiva's attempts to apologize are met with Dolly's fury and disgust, as she calls him ""loathsome"" and a ""stranger"" after his affair with the children's governess. A child's cry briefly softens Dolly, but she eventually threatens to expose Stiva as a ""scoundrel"" and leaves, slamming the door. Stiva is annoyed by her ""vulgar"" outburst.

Meanwhile, Konstantin Dmitrievitch Levin, an old friend of Stiva's, arrives in Moscow with the intention of proposing to Kitty Shtcherbatskaya, Dolly's younger sister. Levin, a country gentleman, is deeply in love with Kitty but considers himself unworthy due to his lack of a conventional career and his perceived unattractiveness. He had previously left Moscow in despair but returned with a firm resolve to propose. He visits Stiva at his office, where Stiva, despite his own domestic troubles, is charming and efficient. Stiva tells Levin that Kitty is at the Zoological Gardens.

Levin, filled with excitement and dread, goes to the skating rink and sees Kitty. He is captivated by her beauty and grace. They skate together, and Kitty expresses confidence in him. Levin, in a moment of panic, blurts out that his staying depends on her, which causes her to withdraw. He is distraught. Stiva then arrives and invites Levin to dinner.

At the restaurant, Stiva reveals that Count Vronsky, a wealthy and charming Petersburg officer, is also a suitor for Kitty and is favored by her mother. Levin is angered by this news, feeling his love is profaned. Stiva then asks Levin for advice on his own affair, describing his mistress as a ""sweet, gentle loving creature."" Levin expresses disgust for ""fallen women."" Stiva, in turn, criticizes Levin's ""all of a piece"" nature. Levin leaves, determined to propose to Kitty that evening.

Kitty, preparing for the evening, feels a mix of pleasure at Levin's love and dread at having to refuse him, as she believes she loves Vronsky. When Levin arrives early and proposes, Kitty, after a moment of ecstasy, remembers Vronsky and hastily refuses Levin. The princess enters, relieved by Kitty's refusal. Countess Nordston, a friend of Kitty's, teases Levin. Vronsky arrives, and Kitty's radiant eyes confirm to Levin that she loves Vronsky. Levin, heartbroken, leaves the ball, his last impression being Kitty's happy face as she talks to Vronsky.

Kitty, despite her happiness, feels remorse over Levin's suffering. Downstairs, the prince furiously scolds the princess for pushing Kitty towards Vronsky, whom he calls a ""peacock,"" and praises Levin. The princess, disturbed, also prays.

Vronsky, unaware of the parents' conversation, feels a strong bond with Kitty and believes she loves him. He goes home, content. The next morning, at the railway station, Vronsky meets Stiva, who is there to meet his sister, Anna Karenina. Stiva hints at Levin's proposal and Kitty's rejection. The train arrives, and Vronsky is struck by Anna's ""caressing and soft"" expression and ""shining gray eyes."" He introduces himself. Anna, with a decisive gesture, embraces Stiva. Vronsky's mother, Countess Vronskaya, tells him Anna is ""very sweet"" and that he is ""in perfect love."" Anna gives Vronsky her hand, and he is delighted. As they leave, a man is crushed by a train. Vronsky generously gives 200 roubles to the widow. Anna, visibly agitated, calls the accident an ""omen of evil"" and asks about Vronsky's acquaintance with him and Kitty.

Anna spends the day at Dolly's, successfully reconciling her and Stiva. She tells Dolly she is leaving Moscow early because Kitty is jealous of her. Dolly expresses concern about Kitty marrying Vronsky if he could be so easily swayed by Anna. Anna blushes, then admits she is leaving to avoid Vronsky. Stiva arrives, and Anna leaves for Petersburg, feeling a mixture of relief and dread. On the train, she is tormented by a sense of shame and a nervous tension, experiencing hallucinations. At a station, she encounters Vronsky, who declares his love, saying he came ""to be where you are."" She tells him his words are ""wrong"" and asks him to forget them, but feels they have been brought ""fearfully closer."" She arrives in Petersburg, where her husband, Alexey Alexandrovitch, meets her with a ""sarcastic smile"" and a ""consciousness of hypocrisy."" She dismisses her intense feelings for Vronsky as a ""trivial incident.""

**PART TWO**

Levin, back in the country, still suffers from his rejection, but time and work help. He has kept his resolution of purity and visited his ailing brother Nikolay, persuading him to go abroad. Spring arrives, filling Levin with plans for his farm. He is frustrated by the slovenliness of his laborers but finds joy in working alongside them, even mowing himself.

Stiva visits Levin, ostensibly for shooting and to sell his forest. He reveals Kitty is very ill and has been sent abroad. Levin is shocked but also feels a sense of satisfaction that she is suffering. He is further angered when Stiva sells his forest to a merchant, Ryabinin, for a low price, which Levin attributes to Stiva's city ignorance and the merchant's cunning. Levin confronts Stiva about his aristocratic values and his own rejection by Kitty, declaring her a ""painful and humiliating reminiscence.""

During a shooting expedition, Stiva tells Levin that Kitty is ""very ill"" and ""may not live."" Levin is deeply affected but tries to dismiss it. He is pleased by his successful shooting.

Alexey Alexandrovitch and Anna continue to live as strangers. He is helpless against her ""amused perplexity"" regarding his suspicions. Vronsky's passion for Anna is fulfilled. She feels sinful and humiliated, sinking to his feet, begging forgiveness. Vronsky feels like a ""murderer"" of their initial love. Anna declares, ""All is over; I have nothing but you."" She is haunted by a dream of both men being her husbands.

Levin, after Nikolay's death, is consumed by questions of life and death, finding no answers in science or philosophy. He considers suicide but continues to live, finding solace in his work and family life. He is exasperated by his brother Nikolay's irritable and self-deceiving behavior and his distorted views on communism. Nikolay dies, leaving Levin with a profound sense of the ""insoluble enigma"" of death.

Kitty, at the German watering-place, is ill and ashamed after her refusal of Levin and Vronsky's betrayal. She confides in Dolly, who has come to visit. Kitty expresses disgust with her own ""loathsome thoughts"" and the artificiality of society. She finds solace in a new friendship with Varenka, a philanthropic Russian girl, and becomes fascinated by Madame Stahl, a highly religious invalid. Kitty attempts to emulate Varenka's life of service, but her father, Prince Shtcherbatsky, returns and, with his cynical humor, shatters her idealized view of Madame Stahl, revealing her as a vain woman with short legs. Kitty realizes her attempts at self-improvement were ""sham.""

Alexey Alexandrovitch, after Anna's confession of infidelity, is initially furious and decides on a divorce. However, his feelings of pity for Anna during her illness, and the ""joy of forgiveness,"" lead him to a spiritual transformation. He forgives Anna and Vronsky, and feels a peculiar tenderness for the newborn baby, who is not his. He becomes deeply involved in Seryozha's education and philanthropic work. Countess Lidia Ivanovna, a friend of Alexey Alexandrovitch, supports his new spiritual path and takes over the management of his household. She tells Seryozha his mother is dead.

Vronsky, after shooting himself in despair over Anna's illness and Alexey Alexandrovitch's magnanimity, recovers. He feels his shame is ""washed away"" and decides to accept an appointment in Tashkend, renouncing Anna. However, Betsy informs him that Alexey Alexandrovitch has agreed to a divorce. Vronsky, forgetting his resolutions, rushes to Anna. They reconcile, and Anna declares, ""Yes, you have conquered me, and I am yours."" She is concerned about Seryozha and refuses to consider a divorce if it means losing her son. Vronsky, sacrificing his ambition, declines the Tashkend appointment and retires from the army. Anna and Vronsky go abroad without a divorce, having abandoned the idea.

**PART THREE**

Sergey Ivanovitch visits Levin in the country. Levin is uncomfortable with his brother's idealized view of peasant life and his own inability to reconcile his intellectual pursuits with practical farming. Levin is consumed by his new system of agriculture, based on understanding the laborer's character. He is frustrated by the peasants' resistance to new methods.

Levin is delighted when Kitty, now his wife, insists on accompanying him to his dying brother Nikolay's bedside, despite his initial objections. Kitty, with her practical and compassionate nature, takes charge of Nikolay's care, bringing order and comfort to his sickroom, much to Levin's astonishment and relief. Nikolay dies, and Levin, witnessing his wife's strength and love, finds solace and a new understanding of life and death. He realizes that love saves him from despair and that Kitty is pregnant.

Alexey Alexandrovitch, now alone with Seryozha, struggles with his new life. He is overwhelmed by domestic details and the contempt he perceives from others. Countess Lidia Ivanovna becomes his confidante, offering spiritual guidance and taking over his household. She reinforces his belief in a new, mystical form of Christianity and his ""delusion of salvation."" She intercepts a letter from Anna asking to see Seryozha, telling Anna there will be ""no answer"" to avoid causing Alexey Alexandrovitch further pain.

Anna and Vronsky, living in Italy, are initially happy. Vronsky pursues painting, and Mihailov, a talented Russian artist, paints Anna's portrait, which is greatly admired. However, Vronsky's interest in art wanes, and he realizes his life with Anna is becoming tedious. They decide to return to Russia.

**PART FOUR**

Levin and Kitty are married. Their honeymoon is a period of unexpected quarrels and adjustments, as Levin realizes married life is far from his idealized dreams. He is frustrated by Kitty's focus on domestic details and her occasional jealousy. However, they reconcile, finding deeper happiness. Levin continues his work on his book about agriculture, now seeing it as a necessary balance to his happy personal life. He develops a theory that Russian agriculture suffers from imported Western civilization and that the Russian laborer has a unique relationship to the land.

Anna and Vronsky return to Petersburg. Vronsky tries to re-enter society with Anna, but quickly realizes that while society is open to him, it is closed to her due to their irregular position. His cousin Betsy and sister-in-law Varya refuse to fully embrace Anna. Anna, meanwhile, is tormented by the separation from Seryozha. She tries to see him but is thwarted by Countess Lidia Ivanovna. On Seryozha's birthday, Anna secretly visits him, finding him grown and changed. Their reunion is deeply emotional, but she is forced to leave when Alexey Alexandrovitch arrives. She is overwhelmed by guilt and despair.

Vronsky is increasingly frustrated by Anna's jealousy and the indefiniteness of their position. He proposes they get a divorce and marry, but Anna is reluctant to leave Seryozha. She fears losing his love and feels trapped. She experiences a recurring nightmare of a peasant muttering French words. She tells Vronsky she is pregnant and believes she will die in childbirth.

Alexey Alexandrovitch, after his spiritual transformation, is initially willing to grant Anna a divorce but is swayed by Countess Lidia Ivanovna's arguments against it, particularly regarding Seryozha's welfare. He refuses the divorce, insisting on maintaining the ""external forms of propriety."" He is increasingly absorbed in his official duties and his new, mystical religious beliefs.

**PART FIVE**

Levin and Kitty are in Moscow, awaiting the birth of their child. Kitty is calm and happy, embracing her new feeling of motherhood. Levin, however, is restless and bored in the city, finding his intellectual pursuits stifled. He is still troubled by his lack of faith and his past. He meets Vronsky at Princess Marya Borissovna's, but Kitty handles the encounter with composure, much to Levin's relief.

Levin confesses his past promiscuity and unbelief to Kitty, giving her his diary. His unbelief does not bother her, but his past makes her weep. She forgives him, and he feels even more unworthy but cherishes his happiness.

Stepan Arkadyevitch, struggling with debts, seeks a new lucrative government appointment in Petersburg. He also tries to persuade Alexey Alexandrovitch to grant Anna a divorce. Alexey Alexandrovitch, influenced by Countess Lidia Ivanovna and a clairvoyant named Landau (now Count Bezzubov), refuses the divorce, citing religious scruples and the welfare of Seryozha. He believes Anna's actions are a ""crime"" and she deserves to suffer.

Anna and Vronsky are in Moscow, waiting for the divorce. Anna is increasingly irritable and jealous, feeling Vronsky's love is waning. She blames him for her misery and separation from Seryozha. She threatens to die and reveals her recurring nightmare. Vronsky, frustrated by her accusations, agrees to go to the country with her.

**PART SIX**

Dolly and her children spend the summer at Levin's estate, Pokrovskoe, along with the old princess and Varenka. Levin is initially overwhelmed by the ""Shtcherbatsky element"" but finds joy in his family life and farming. Kitty, now pregnant, is happy and enjoys her domestic role.

Sergey Ivanovitch, having failed with his book, becomes engrossed in the Slavonic question and the Servian War, seeing it as a manifestation of public opinion. He visits Levin, bringing Katavasov with him. They discuss the war, and Levin argues against it, believing it is not the ""will of the people.""

Levin, Stiva, and Vassenka Veslovsky go shooting. Vassenka's ineptitude and flirtation with Kitty infuriate Levin, triggering his jealousy. He confronts Kitty, who, though hurt, understands his love. Levin, feeling ashamed of his outburst, sends Veslovsky away.

Dolly visits Anna and Vronsky at Vozdvizhenskoe. She is impressed by their luxurious lifestyle but feels uncomfortable with their irregular situation. Vronsky confides in Dolly, expressing his desire for a divorce to legitimize his daughter (Anna's child) and future children, and to pursue his public duties without the ""falsity"" of their current life. He asks Dolly to persuade Anna to write to Alexey Alexandrovitch for a divorce.

Anna tells Dolly she has chosen not to have more children, a decision Dolly finds shocking. Anna expresses her despair at her ""unnatural"" position and her inability to live without Vronsky's love, but also her fear of his waning affection. She feels trapped and miserable. Dolly, saddened by Anna's plight, resolves to return home to her own family.

**PART SEVEN**

Levin and Kitty are in Moscow, still awaiting the birth of their child. Kitty is calm and happy, but Levin is restless and bored. He meets Vronsky at a social gathering, and they exchange polite words, with Levin feeling no hostility. Levin, however, is still troubled by his own lack of faith and the meaninglessness of life.

Kitty goes into labor. Levin experiences intense terror and helplessness, praying to God despite his unbelief. He is overwhelmed by Kitty's suffering but also by her strength and love. Their son, Mitya, is born. Levin feels a profound, almost physical, joy and a new sense of love and apprehension for his child. He realizes that love and life are intertwined with suffering and death, and that his faith, though not intellectual, is real.

Stepan Arkadyevitch, still pursuing his lucrative appointment, visits Alexey Alexandrovitch in Petersburg to press for Anna's divorce. Alexey Alexandrovitch, influenced by Countess Lidia Ivanovna and Landau, refuses the divorce. He believes Anna's actions are a sin and that he is acting according to Christian principles by not granting it. He has become an ardent adherent of a new mystical interpretation of Christianity.

Anna and Vronsky, now in Moscow, are increasingly estranged. Anna's jealousy and Vronsky's growing weariness lead to constant quarrels. Anna feels his love is waning and that he despises her. She is tormented by the thought of losing him and her son, Seryozha. She decides that death is the only escape from her misery and the only way to punish Vronsky and regain his love. She goes to the railway station, remembering the man crushed by the train when she first met Vronsky. In a moment of despair, she throws herself under an approaching train. The light in her eyes flickers and is ""quenched forever.""

**PART EIGHT**

Two months after Anna's death, Sergey Ivanovitch's book, ""Sketch of a Survey of the Principles and Forms of Government in Europe and Russia,"" is published but receives little attention. A critical article, written by a young invalid whom Sergey Ivanovitch had once corrected, ridicules his work. Sergey Ivanovitch is disappointed but soon becomes engrossed in the Slavonic question and the Servian War, finding a new purpose in expressing ""public opinion.""

Sergey Ivanovitch and Katavasov travel to Levin's country estate. On the train, they observe volunteers going to Servia. Sergey Ivanovitch meets Vronsky at a station. Vronsky, aged and worn by suffering, is also going to Servia, having taken a squadron at his own expense. He tells Sergey Ivanovitch that life is ""worth nothing"" to him and he is glad to have something to ""give my life for."" He is haunted by the memory of Anna's death.

Levin, at home, is still struggling with his newfound faith. He is drawn into an argument with Sergey Ivanovitch and Katavasov about the Servian War and the ""will of the people."" Levin argues that war is wrong and that the people do not truly understand or support it. A storm breaks, and Levin, fearing for Kitty and Mitya, is relieved to find them safe. He reflects on his love for his family and his faith, which, though not intellectual, gives his life meaning.

Levin attends the provincial elections with Sergey Ivanovitch. He is bored by the political maneuvering and the ""nonsense"" of the proceedings. Vronsky is also present, having come to support Nevyedovsky, the new liberal candidate for marshal of the province. Levin and Vronsky meet, and Levin, trying to be friendly, makes a clumsy remark about justices of the peace. Nevyedovsky is elected, and Vronsky celebrates his success, finding a new interest in public life.

Levin and Kitty are in Moscow, where Kitty is expecting their second child. Levin is still wrestling with his spiritual doubts and the practicalities of his estate. He is also troubled by his financial situation. Kitty, however, is calm and happy, embracing her role as a mother. She is not afraid of childbirth.

The text concludes with Levin's deep internal monologue. He has found a profound, non-rational faith that gives his life meaning and purpose. He acknowledges his imperfections and the ongoing struggles of life but feels a ""positive meaning of goodness"" in every moment. He is at peace, despite the insoluble questions of life and death, because he has found God through his heart and love."
Crime and Punishment-Fyodor Dostoyevsky,"The story begins on a hot July evening with a young man named Raskolnikov leaving his garret in S. Place. He is deeply in debt to his landlady and avoids meeting her, feeling irritable and isolated due to his poverty and hypochondria. He is contemplating ""a thing like that,"" which he initially dismisses as a fantasy but now sees as a serious endeavor. He is concerned about his worn-out hat making him too noticeable.

He walks to a large house for a ""rehearsal"" of his project, noting that a German clerk is moving out, leaving only an old woman on the fourth floor. He rings the bell of the old woman, Alyona Ivanovna, a sixty-year-old pawnbroker. He introduces himself as a student and offers an old silver watch to pawn. Alyona Ivanovna, who is suspicious and calculates a meager sum, reminds him his previous pledge is due. He accepts the money, but before leaving, he casually asks if her sister is always with her. She questions his business. Raskolnikov leaves in a state of agitation, feeling intense repulsion for the ""atrocious thing"" he is planning. He enters a tavern, drinks beer, and briefly feels better, dismissing his dark thoughts.

In the tavern, a drunk, retired government clerk named Marmeladov approaches Raskolnikov. Marmeladov delivers a long, solemn monologue about his extreme poverty, his alcoholism, and the suffering of his family. He reveals that his daughter, Sonia, has been forced into prostitution to support them, and his wife, Katerina Ivanovna, a proud and sickly woman, has been reduced to despair. Marmeladov confesses to stealing his wife's money, including Sonia's earnings, to drink. He recounts how Sonia silently placed 30 roubles on the table, and Katerina Ivanovna knelt and kissed her feet. He asks Raskolnikov to accompany him home.

At Marmeladov's squalid lodging in Kozel’s house, Katerina Ivanovna, emaciated and coughing, screams at her husband for drinking away their money and selling his clothes. She drags him by the hair, while he calls it a ""consolation."" The terrified children cry. Katerina Ivanovna then turns on Raskolnikov, accusing him of drinking with her husband. As he leaves, Raskolnikov secretly places some coppers on the window, then regrets it, but dismisses the thought. He reflects on Sonia's sacrifice and the nature of humanity.

The next day, Raskolnikov wakes late in his tiny, dirty room. His landlady, Praskovya Pavlovna, is threatening to complain to the police about his unpaid rent. Nastasya, the servant, brings him a letter from his mother, Pulcheria Alexandrovna. The letter informs him that his sister, Dounia, has been working as a governess for the Svidrigaïlovs, where Mr. Svidrigaïlov made ""infamous proposals"" to her. Dounia was unjustly accused by Mr. Svidrigaïlov's wife, Marfa Petrovna, but later cleared by Mr. Svidrigaïlov himself, who provided proof of her innocence. Dounia is now engaged to Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin, a wealthy, forty-five-year-old counsellor, who expects a submissive wife. Dounia and their mother are coming to Petersburg, and Luzhin has offered to pay some expenses. His mother hopes Luzhin will help Raskolnikov with his career.

Raskolnikov is enraged by the letter, seeing Dounia's marriage as a sacrifice for his sake. He vows to prevent it, but questions his ability to do so, realizing he is a burden. He recalls Marmeladov's despairing question about having ""nowhere to turn."" His ""plan"" to kill the old pawnbroker resurfaces as a menacing reality. He then encounters a young, drunk girl on a boulevard and attempts to protect her from a gentleman (Svidrigaïlov), giving a policeman money to take her home. However, he quickly retracts, telling the policeman to let them be, questioning his right to interfere. He then remembers he was going to see his old university comrade, Razumihin, for work.

He decides against visiting Razumihin, thinking he will go ""after It,"" after his plan is executed. He wanders aimlessly, feeling feverish, and falls asleep in a park. He has a vivid nightmare of a peasant, Mikolka, brutally beating and killing an old mare. He wakes in terror, realizing the dream's connection to his own murderous intent. He feels he cannot commit the act and experiences a moment of relief and freedom. However, on his way home, he overhears Lizaveta, the pawnbroker's sister, arranging to be away the next day at seven o'clock, leaving Alyona Ivanovna alone. This ""chance"" encounter solidifies his resolve.

The next morning, Raskolnikov, still feverish, prepares for the murder. He makes a noose for the axe and retrieves a fake pledge. He attempts to steal an axe from his landlady's kitchen but finds Nastasya there. He then finds an axe in the porter's room and hides it. He arrives at Alyona Ivanovna's flat at seven o'clock. She opens the door, and he enters, presenting the fake pledge. While she is distracted trying to untie it, he strikes her head with the axe, killing her. He then finds her keys and discovers a strong-box full of gold and jewels. As he is collecting the valuables, Lizaveta unexpectedly enters. In a panic, he kills her too with the axe. Overwhelmed by fear and loathing, he washes the axe and his hands. He realizes the outer door was left open. He hears two men (Koch and a young man) knocking and shouting at the old woman's door, realizing someone is inside. He hides in an empty flat on the second floor while they go upstairs, then slips away unseen. He returns to his room, exhausted.

Raskolnikov wakes up in a fever, realizing he left the stolen items in his pockets. He hides them in a hole in his wall. He is summoned to the police office for an IOU debt to his landlady. He is terrified, thinking it's about the murder, but feels immense relief when he realizes it's only the debt. He argues with the assistant superintendent, Ilya Petrovitch, and explains his IOU. He faints during a discussion about the murder, overhearing that the painter Nikolay has been accused. He leaves the police station, convinced they suspect him.

He frantically hides the stolen items under a stone in a deserted courtyard. He then visits Razumihin, who is concerned about his illness and offers him translation work. Raskolnikov refuses, saying he wants no one's help. On the Nikolaevsky Bridge, he throws a 20-copeck coin he received from a charitable woman into the Neva, feeling he has ""cut himself off from everyone."" He returns home and is woken by the sounds of Ilya Petrovitch beating his landlady. Nastasya tells him he is imagining it, that it's ""the blood crying in your ears."" He falls unconscious.

He wakes up to Razumihin, Zossimov (a doctor), and a messenger delivering 35 roubles from his mother. Razumihin reveals he has paid off Raskolnikov's IOU and bought him new clothes. He tells Raskolnikov that in his delirium, he raved about ""earrings and chains"" and his sock. Raskolnikov is alarmed. Later, he goes to a restaurant, reads newspaper accounts of the murder, and then confronts Zametov, the head clerk. He subtly implies his guilt, describing how he would hide stolen items, and then whispers, ""And what if it was I who murdered the old woman and Lizaveta?"" Zametov is terrified. Raskolnikov pays with the money from his mother, showing it to Zametov. He then encounters Razumihin, who is furious about his disappearance. Raskolnikov tells Razumihin he wants to be alone.

Raskolnikov then finds himself at the murder scene, now being redecorated. He rings the bell repeatedly, feeling the terror return. He tells the workmen he is looking for a flat and asks about the blood. He gives his name and address to the porter and others. The porter, prompted by a man in a long coat, flings Raskolnikov into the street. He then witnesses Marmeladov being run over and killed. He identifies Marmeladov and insists he be taken to his lodging, giving Katerina Ivanovna 20 roubles for the funeral. Sonia arrives, dressed in her gaudy attire, and Katerina Ivanovna, in despair, hands her children over to Sonia before dying. Svidrigaïlov appears and tells Raskolnikov he heard everything from next door and will provide for the children and Sonia, using the 10,000 roubles he had intended for Dounia.

Raskolnikov enters a period of mental fog. He meets Svidrigaïlov again, who confirms he overheard Raskolnikov's confession to Sonia. Svidrigaïlov, who has also seen ghosts of his deceased wife, Marfa Petrovna, reveals his cynical philosophy of life, his past depravity, and his intention to marry a sixteen-year-old girl. He offers Dounia 10,000 roubles (and reveals Marfa Petrovna left her 3,000 roubles in her will) to break off her engagement to Luzhin. Raskolnikov is disgusted but recognizes Svidrigaïlov's power.

Dounia and Pulcheria Alexandrovna break off the engagement with Luzhin after he insults Raskolnikov and attempts to frame Sonia for theft. Lebeziatnikov exposes Luzhin's scheme, revealing he saw Luzhin plant the 100-rouble note on Sonia. Luzhin leaves, filled with hatred. Katerina Ivanovna, driven to madness by her misfortunes, takes her children into the street to beg, but collapses and dies from consumption. Svidrigaïlov arranges her funeral and places the children in an orphanage, settling 1,500 roubles on each. He tells Raskolnikov he is doing this with the money he intended for Dounia, repeating Raskolnikov's own cynical words about ""lice"" and ""humanity.""

Raskolnikov, realizing Svidrigaïlov overheard his confession, confronts him. Svidrigaïlov confirms he heard everything from his adjoining room. Svidrigaïlov, after a final, disturbing conversation with Raskolnikov, gives his fiancée 15,000 roubles and then commits suicide by shooting himself in the head in front of a soldier.

Raskolnikov, after a final, tormented conversation with his mother and sister, where he struggles to express his love and his burden, tells them he must leave. He gives Dounia a portrait of his deceased fiancée. He then goes to Sonia, who has been waiting for him. He confesses to her that he is the murderer of Alyona Ivanovna and Lizaveta. He explains his theory of ""extraordinary"" men having the right to transgress moral laws, and his desire to prove himself a ""man"" rather than a ""louse."" Sonia, horrified but compassionate, urges him to confess publicly, to ""suffer and expiate your sin."" He resists, saying he is not a ""louse"" and will fight them. Sonia offers him her cypress wood cross.

He goes to the police station. On the way, he sees Sonia following him. He bows down in the Hay Market, kissing the earth, but the words ""I am a murderer"" die on his lips due to the mocking crowd. He enters the police office and, finding Ilya Petrovitch, confesses to killing the old pawnbroker and her sister Lizaveta with an axe.

In the Epilogue, Raskolnikov is confined in a Siberian prison. His trial was straightforward due to his clear confession. The court attributes his crime to ""temporary mental derangement"" and ""homicidal mania"" because he made no use of the stolen money and trinkets, which were found under a stone. He is sentenced to eight years of penal servitude. Razumihin and Dounia marry, planning to move to Siberia in five years. Raskolnikov's mother dies of brain fever, having suspected her son's terrible fate. Sonia follows Raskolnikov to Siberia, visiting him regularly. The other convicts dislike Raskolnikov, calling him an ""infidel,"" but they love Sonia. Raskolnikov remains sullen and unrepentant, still believing his crime was a ""blunder"" rather than a moral failing. He has a dream of a global plague that makes everyone mad. After a long illness, he recovers. One day, at work on the river bank, he sees Sonia. He is suddenly overcome with emotion, falls at her feet, and weeps. He realizes he loves her and that a new life is beginning for him. He feels a profound change, a ""resurrection into a new life,"" and that ""life had stepped into the place of theory."" He has Sonia's New Testament under his pillow, and though he hasn't opened it, he wonders if her convictions and aspirations can now be his. The story ends with the beginning of his gradual renewal and regeneration."
Death in Venice-Thomas Mann,"Gustav Aschenbach, a renowned writer officially known as von Aschenbach after his fiftieth birthday, takes a long walk in Munich one spring afternoon in 19--. Overwrought from his demanding work, he is unable to find rest and hopes that fresh air will rejuvenate him. While waiting for a tram at the North Cemetery, he notices an unusually dressed, red-haired man whose appearance sparks in him a sudden, intense desire for travel, a ""youthful longing after far-off places,"" which he recognizes as an urge to escape the ""steady drudgery"" of his work. Despite his previous disinterest in extensive travel and his current artistic discontent, he decides to take a three-to-four-week trip to a pleasant southern resort.

The narrative then delves into Aschenbach's background, detailing his disciplined life as an artist. Born in Silesia to a family of public servants, with a more sensuous strain from his Bohemian mother, he achieved early fame despite a frail constitution. He was known for his rigorous dedication to his craft, building his epic works ""layer by layer."" His art often explored a ""new hero-type"" characterized by ""intellectual and youthful masculinity"" that gracefully confronts adversity. After a youthful period of skepticism, he embraced dignity and a ""reborn ingenuousness,"" which coincided with a heightened appreciation for beauty in his work. He was knighted on his fiftieth birthday and settled in Munich. His marriage ended with his wife's death, leaving him with a married daughter but no son. His face, marked by his art, reflected a life of ""imaginary and spiritual adventures.""

About two weeks after his walk in Munich, Aschenbach departs. He travels by night train to Trieste, then by ship to Pola, seeking something foreign. However, he finds the Adriatic island he chose dissatisfying due to the weather and atmosphere, realizing his true destination is Venice. He quickly arranges passage on an old, decrepit Italian ship. On board, he encounters a dirty, hunchbacked sailor and a circus-director-like ticket seller. He also observes a group of young clerks, one of whom, a boisterous ""youth"" in fashionable attire, Aschenbach realizes with ""horror"" is an old man disguised with paint, a wig, and false teeth. This encounter leaves him feeling a ""dream-like estrangement.""

The ship sails through grey, damp weather, and Aschenbach falls asleep. At noon, he eats a poor meal, then returns to the deck, hoping for brighter skies over Venice, but the weather remains dreary. As they approach Venice, he reflects on the city's poetic allure. The ship waits for a health department barque. During this delay, he again observes the disguised old man, now painfully drunk, swaying and making suggestive gestures, his false teeth falling out. Aschenbach feels a ""numbness"" and a sense of the world distorting into the grotesque.

Upon arrival, Aschenbach requests a gondola to take him to the steamer dock for the Lido. The same old man from the ship attempts a drunken farewell. Aschenbach boards a black gondola, feeling a ""shudder"" and associating the craft with death. The gondolier, a brutal-looking man, rows him towards the open sea instead of the requested steamer dock, insisting Aschenbach is going to the Lido. Aschenbach, feeling the gondolier's insolence and his own inertia, yields. After a brief encounter with musical brigands, they arrive at the Lido dock. Aschenbach goes to get change to pay the gondolier, but when he returns, the gondola and gondolier have vanished. An old man at the dock informs him the gondolier was unlicensed. Aschenbach proceeds to his beach hotel.

In his hotel room, Aschenbach reflects on how loneliness magnifies strange experiences. He has tea on the terrace and later, in the lobby, observes other guests. He is particularly struck by a Polish family, especially a fourteen-year-old boy named Tadzio, whose ""absolutely beautiful"" face, with honey-colored hair and ""godlike seriousness,"" reminds him of Greek sculpture. He notes the boy's pampered appearance contrasts sharply with his sisters' severe attire. Aschenbach, as an artist, feels a deep sympathy for this aristocratic beauty. Tadzio's eyes meet Aschenbach's before the family enters the dining room. Aschenbach dines, regretting the distance from their table, and spends the night dreaming.

The next day, the weather remains poor, and Aschenbach feels depressed, considering leaving Venice due to its unhealthy effect on him. At breakfast, he sees Tadzio, whose entrance is marked by ""extraordinary charm"" and ""godlike beauty."" Aschenbach goes to the beach and decides to stay, finding solace in the view. He observes Tadzio playing, noting his disdain for a Russian family. He deduces the boy's name is Tadzio. He watches Tadzio swim, emerging from the sea like a ""frail god,"" which evokes a ""sense of myth"" in Aschenbach. He feels a ""paternal affection"" for the boy. Later, in the lift, Aschenbach sees Tadzio up close and notices his ""jagged and pale"" teeth, concluding he is ""very frail"" and ""sickly,"" and ""will not grow old,"" a thought that brings him a peculiar ""gratification.""

That afternoon, Aschenbach visits Venice, but the sultry, odorous air and crowds depress him, causing physical discomfort. He decides he must leave, planning to go to another watering place. He returns to the hotel, announces his departure, settles his accounts, and prepares his luggage. The next morning, he regrets his hasty decision as the air feels fresher. At breakfast, hotel staff pressure him to leave quickly, but he insists on finishing his meal. Tadzio passes him, their eyes meeting. Aschenbach silently bids Tadzio farewell. On the steamboat, he experiences intense regret and realizes how deeply attached he is to Venice, feeling it would be ""insufferable"" never to see it again.

At the station, he learns his trunk has been mistakenly sent to Como. This error, to his ""adventurous delight,"" provides an excuse to return to the Lido. He arranges for his ticket to be redeemed and his trunk recovered, and within minutes, he is back on the Grand Canal, returning to the hotel. He finds this turn of events comically dreamlike and a stroke of fate. Back in his room, he sees Tadzio returning from the sea and realizes Tadzio was the true reason it was so hard to leave. He accepts this realization with a ""spontaneous act of welcome.""

Days turn into weeks. Aschenbach, now settled indefinitely, is enchanted by the relaxed pace of life and the constant presence of Tadzio. He rises early to watch Tadzio on the beach, observing his every movement and finding ""godlike sculpture"" in his form. He connects Tadzio's beauty to ancient Greek philosophy, particularly the Socratic dialogue on Eros and beauty as the path to the spiritual. Inspired, he writes a short, acclaimed prose piece, finding ""Eros in the word."" He attempts to approach Tadzio on the beach but is overcome by breathlessness and fear, passing him with bowed head. He recognizes his ""intoxication"" is too precious to abandon.

He sends for more money, his only concern being Tadzio's departure. He spends his days in a state of happy unrest, waking at dawn to watch the sunrise, which he interprets as the rising of Eros. He sees Tadzio in the park and imagines him as Hyacinth, loved by gods. He notes the unspoken familiarity between them, with Tadzio sometimes walking unnecessarily close to his table on the beach, and their glances meeting with serious intensity. One evening, Tadzio smiles at Aschenbach, a ""deep, fascinated, magnetic smile"" like Narcissus. Overwhelmed, Aschenbach retreats to the dark park and whispers, ""I love you!""

In his fourth week, Aschenbach notices fewer guests and a strange, sickly smell in Venice. He learns from the hotel barber about ""the plague,"" though the barber is evasive. In Venice, he confirms the smell and sees municipal warnings about gastric diseases, realizing the authorities are covering up a serious epidemic. He reads newspapers, finding official denials and vague statistics. He feels a ""dark contentment"" that the city's ""wicked secret"" aligns with his own hidden passion, and he fears Tadzio leaving more than the plague.

He begins to stalk Tadzio, following him through the city's labyrinthine streets, even secretly pursuing him in a gondola. He returns late one evening and, in a state of ""utter drunkenness,"" lays his head against Tadzio's room door. He has moments of lucidity, questioning his actions, but rationalizes his infatuation as a form of artistic heroism. He learns the full truth about the Indian cholera epidemic from an English travel clerk: it is widespread, highly fatal, and the Venetian authorities are suppressing the information to protect tourism, leading to social decay and a rise in crime.

The Englishman advises him to leave immediately, but Aschenbach, intoxicated by his ""possession of the truth"" and valuing the ""advantages of chaos"" over prudence, decides to remain silent and stay in Venice. That night, he has a ""frightful dream"" of a Bacchic orgy, a frenzied, lewd experience where he is drawn into the ""unchastity and fury of decay,"" belonging to a ""foreign god."" He awakens shattered, no longer caring about appearances. Guests flee, but Tadzio's family remains. Aschenbach, in his infatuation, sees the ""atrocious"" possibilities in the plague-ridden city, with ""laws of morality dropped away.""

He attempts to rejuvenate his appearance to please Tadzio, visiting the barber to have his hair dyed black, curled, and his skin treated with cosmetics to make him look younger. The barber remarks, ""Now the gentleman can fall in love unhesitatingly."" Aschenbach, now made up, feels ""happy as in a dream."" He continues to track Tadzio through the diseased city, getting lost and exhausted. Tadzio, aware of Aschenbach's pursuit, occasionally looks back, confirming he is being followed but ""did not betray him.""

One afternoon, Aschenbach loses sight of Tadzio. Exhausted and feverish, he buys and eats overly ripe strawberries. He sits on steps in a deserted square, recalling his earlier plans to flee. In a semi-slumber, he has a final internal monologue, a distorted philosophical reflection on beauty, Eros, and the artist's perilous path through the senses to the spiritual. He concludes that poets are necessarily ""lascivious"" and ""adventurers in emotion,"" their mastery a ""farce,"" and that form and openness, while yielding beauty, also lead to ""intoxication and to desire,"" and ultimately to the ""precipice."" He ends by saying, ""And now I am going, Phaedrus. You stay here; and when you no longer see me, then you go too.""

A few days later, Aschenbach feels unwell, experiencing vertigo and a sense of bafflement. He learns the Polish family is leaving after lunch. He goes to the beach, which now looks autumnal and abandoned. Tadzio and his few remaining companions are playing unsupervised. Tadzio is forced into a wrestling match by Jaschu, who then presses Tadzio's face into the sand, nearly strangling him. Aschenbach, enraged, is about to intervene when Jaschu releases Tadzio. Tadzio, pale and disheveled, slowly walks away from his companions towards the sea. He stands on a sand-bank, facing the open sea, then turns and looks over his shoulder towards the shore. Aschenbach, watching, sees Tadzio's ""pale and lovely lure"" smiling and nodding to him, signaling him to ""come out,"" guiding him towards ""egregious promises."" Aschenbach, ""as often before,"" stands up to follow him.

Minutes later, Aschenbach collapses in his chair. He is brought to his room. On the same day, the world receives news of his death."
Don Quixote-Miguel de Cervantes,"The story begins by introducing a gentleman from a village in La Mancha, nearing fifty years old, of hardy build, who lives with a housekeeper, a niece, and a lad. He spends most of his time reading books of chivalry with such passion that he neglects his estate and sells land to acquire more books. He particularly enjoys the works of Feliciano de Silva. Through excessive reading, he loses his wits, believing the fantastical events in these books to be true. He argues with his village curate and barber about the merits of famous knights.

Driven by his madness, he decides to become a knight-errant. He cleans his great-grandfather's rusty armor, improvises a helmet from pasteboard (which he tests and breaks, then reinforces), and spends four days naming his old horse, Rocinante. He then names himself Don Quixote of La Mancha, following the example of Amadis of Gaul. Finally, he chooses a lady to be the object of his devotion, a local farm-girl named Aldonza Lorenzo, whom he renames Dulcinea del Toboso.

Don Quixote embarks on his first sally one morning. He soon realizes he has not been formally dubbed a knight. He resolves to be knighted by the first person he encounters. He mistakes an inn for a castle, two young women at the door for fair maidens, and a swineherd's horn for a dwarf's trumpet. The innkeeper, amused by Don Quixote's appearance and speech, plays along, calling himself a ""Castellan."" Don Quixote refuses to remove his helmet, which is tied on, and is fed by one of the girls. He believes the stockfish served is trout and the sowgelder's pipe is castle music. Still, he is distressed by not being knighted.

That night, Don Quixote kneels before the innkeeper, demanding to be dubbed a knight. The innkeeper, still playing along, recounts his own fabricated past as a knight-errant and agrees to the ceremony, claiming there is no chapel but the courtyard will suffice. He advises Don Quixote to carry money, clean shirts, and ointment. Don Quixote places his armor by a well. When a carrier tries to move the armor to water his mules, Don Quixote strikes him with his lance, leaving him senseless. Another carrier suffers the same fate. Other carriers stone Don Quixote, but he defends his armor. The innkeeper intervenes, explaining Don Quixote is mad. To end the commotion, the innkeeper performs a burlesque knighting ceremony, using his account-book as a prayer book and giving Don Quixote a blow to the neck and a slap on the shoulder. The two girls gird on his sword and spur, and Don Quixote renames them Doña Tolosa and Doña Molinera. Don Quixote, now a knight, departs at dawn without paying.

Recalling the innkeeper's advice, Don Quixote decides to return home for money and a squire. On the way, he hears cries and finds a farmer flogging a boy named Andres. Don Quixote, believing the farmer to be a ""discourteous knight,"" orders him to pay Andres his wages. The farmer, terrified, agrees. Don Quixote leaves, satisfied. However, the farmer immediately flogs Andres again, mocking Don Quixote. Andres vows to seek Don Quixote's help. Unaware of this, Don Quixote congratulates himself. He then encounters a group of Toledo traders and demands they confess Dulcinea's unparalleled beauty. When one trader makes a jest, Don Quixote charges, but Rocinante stumbles, throwing him to the ground. A muleteer beats him severely with his own lance, leaving him battered.

A peasant from his village, Pedro Alonso, finds the injured Don Quixote, who, in his delirium, mistakes the peasant for the Marquis of Mantua and recites ballads. The peasant recognizes him and helps him onto his ass, leading him home. At Don Quixote's house, the curate, barber, housekeeper, and niece are discussing his disappearance and blaming his books. Don Quixote, still delusional, claims his injuries are from fighting giants. The curate resolves to burn Don Quixote's books.

The curate and barber proceed to Don Quixote's library. They burn many books of chivalry, sparing only a few, such as ""Amadis of Gaul,"" ""Palmerin of England,"" and ""Tirante el Blanco,"" for various reasons. Don Quixote's shouts interrupt their task. He is found raving about a tourney. They force him back to bed. That night, the housekeeper burns the remaining books. The curate and barber then wall up the room, telling Don Quixote that a magician, Friston, carried the books and room away. Don Quixote believes this, thinking Friston is his enemy who seeks to thwart his glory.

Don Quixote remains home for fifteen days, then persuades a farm laborer, Sancho Panza, to become his squire, promising him the governorship of an island. They prepare for a new sally, with Sancho bringing his ass, Dapple. They depart secretly. Sancho expresses his eagerness to become a governor.

They encounter windmills, which Don Quixote believes are giants. Despite Sancho's protests, Don Quixote charges, breaking his lance and falling. He blames Friston for transforming the giants. He then makes a new lance from an oak branch. He instructs Sancho not to intervene in fights with knights. They next encounter two Benedictine friars and a coach with a lady. Don Quixote believes the friars are magicians abducting a princess. He attacks, unhorsing one friar. Sancho attempts to strip the fallen friar, but the friars' muleteers beat Sancho severely. Don Quixote declares the lady free and commands her to go to El Toboso to present herself to Dulcinea. A Biscayan squire challenges Don Quixote. They fight, and Don Quixote is wounded in the ear and helmet. He defeats the Biscayan, making him promise to go to Dulcinea.

The narrator explains he found the rest of the story in Arabic. The battle concludes with Don Quixote severely wounding the Biscayan, who yields. Sancho, recovered, asks for his island. Don Quixote says it was a ""cross-roads"" adventure, not an island one, but promises future rewards. Sancho expresses fear of the Holy Brotherhood. Don Quixote mentions his Balsam of Fierabras, a miraculous cure. Sancho wants the recipe. Don Quixote, seeing his broken helmet, swears an oath not to eat at a tablecloth or embrace his wife until he gets a new helmet. Sancho worries about the oath's impracticality. They eat Sancho's provisions and spend the night with goatherds.

One of the goatherds tells them the story of Chrysostom, a student-shepherd who died of love for Marcela, a beautiful shepherdess who chose a life of solitude and rejected all suitors. Don Quixote resolves to attend the burial. At the burial, Marcela appears and eloquently defends her right to freedom and her blamelessness in Chrysostom's death. Don Quixote, impressed, defends Marcela and forbids anyone from following her.

Don Quixote and Sancho search for Marcela, then rest. Rocinante tries to mate with Yanguesan ponies, who kick him. Don Quixote and Sancho are beaten by the Yanguesan carriers. Sancho is in pain and asks for the balsam. Don Quixote blames himself for fighting non-knights and tells Sancho he should fight ""rabble"" in the future. Sancho refuses to fight. Don Quixote, injured, is carried on Dapple. He finds a valise with gold crowns and a love letter, concluding it belongs to a despairing lover. They then see a ragged man leaping among rocks, whom Don Quixote believes is the owner.

The ragged man, Cardenio, reveals his identity and tells his story: he loved Luscinda, who was forced to marry Don Fernando, the duke's son. Don Fernando had previously seduced Dorothea, a noble maiden, under promise of marriage. Cardenio witnessed Luscinda's forced wedding, where she fainted and a letter was found revealing her prior marriage to Cardenio. Cardenio, in despair, fled to the mountains. Don Quixote, enraged by Cardenio's story of Queen Madasima, attacks Cardenio, who, in a fit of madness, beats Don Quixote and Sancho.

The curate and barber, searching for Don Quixote, find Cardenio. Dorothea, disguised as a peasant, appears and tells her story, revealing she is the maiden seduced by Don Fernando. Cardenio and Dorothea realize their shared plight and a possible way to reclaim their loves. Sancho returns, having left Don Quixote doing penance. Dorothea agrees to pose as Princess Micomicona, a distressed maiden seeking Don Quixote's help against a giant. Don Quixote accepts her plea, promising to restore her kingdom. Sancho is overjoyed, dreaming of becoming a king. Don Quixote, however, reaffirms his fidelity to Dulcinea, causing Sancho to argue and be beaten by his master. Ricote, a Morisco, appears, riding Dapple, whom Sancho reclaims.

Sancho, having failed to deliver Don Quixote's letter to Dulcinea, invents a story about finding her sifting wheat and her being enchanted. Don Quixote believes this, attributing it to his enemy enchanters. The curate and barber, still trying to get Don Quixote home, plot to disenchant Dulcinea.

At the duke's castle, Don Quixote is received with great ceremony. He is subjected to a washing ritual. Sancho, offended, refuses. Don Quixote describes Dulcinea's beauty, but says she is enchanted into a peasant. The duchess questions if Dulcinea is imaginary. Don Quixote insists she is real and noble. Sancho, in a rage, is again beaten by Don Quixote for speaking ill of Dulcinea. Don Quixote is then pinched and beaten by the duchess and Altisidora (a damsel in the castle) in disguise, who are playing a trick on him.

Sancho, appointed governor of the island of Barataria, is subjected to a strict diet by Doctor Pedro Recio. He delivers several wise judgments, including the case of the cane with hidden gold and the woman who accused a pig dealer. He makes ordinances for his island. He receives a letter from Don Quixote with advice on governing. Sancho replies, complaining of hunger and the doctor. He is then subjected to a mock invasion and attack, where he is bound between shields and trampled. He resigns his governorship, preferring his freedom.

Sancho, on his way back to Don Quixote, falls into a pit with Dapple. Don Quixote, hearing his cries, rescues him. They then encounter the Knight of the White Moon, who challenges Don Quixote to confess his lady is less beautiful than his own. If Don Quixote loses, he must retire home for a year. Don Quixote accepts and is defeated. The Knight of the White Moon is revealed to be the bachelor Samson Carrasco, who sought to force Don Quixote home to cure his madness. Don Quixote, dejected, agrees to retire.

Don Gregorio, the youth Ana Felix loved, is rescued from Algiers. Ricote and Ana Felix are reunited. Don Quixote and Sancho leave the castle, Don Quixote lamenting his defeat. He proposes they become shepherds for his year of retirement. Sancho agrees, but complains about the hardships. They are stampeded by a drove of pigs.

Back at the duke's castle, Don Quixote is subjected to another trick: Altisidora, feigning death from his coldness, is ""resurrected"" by Sancho's supposed whipping. Sancho is again reluctant to inflict the lashes, but eventually agrees to a partial whipping, mostly on trees. Don Quixote believes Dulcinea will be disenchanted.

They encounter Don Álvaro Tarfe, a character from the false ""Second Part"" of Don Quixote's history. Don Álvaro confirms that Don Quixote is not the one he knew, and makes a legal declaration to that effect. Sancho completes his self-flagellation.

Don Quixote and Sancho return to their village. Don Quixote interprets omens negatively. Sancho tries to counter them. At home, Don Quixote falls ill with a fever. On his deathbed, he recovers his sanity, denounces books of chivalry, and makes his will. He leaves money to Sancho and stipulates that his niece must not marry a man who knows about chivalry books. He apologizes to the author of the false ""Second Part."" Don Quixote dies peacefully, as Alonso Quixano the Good, not Don Quixote of La Mancha. The history concludes with epitaphs for Don Quixote, Dulcinea, Rocinante, and Sancho, and the author's final words, declaring his purpose to have been to bring books of chivalry into detestation."
Dracula-Bram Stoker,"The plot of the provided text, ""Dracula,"" unfolds primarily through journal entries, letters, and newspaper clippings, detailing Jonathan Harker's perilous journey to Transylvania and the subsequent efforts of a group of friends to combat a supernatural evil.

**Jonathan Harker's Ordeal in Transylvania:**
Jonathan Harker, a newly qualified solicitor, travels from Munich to Bistritz, Transylvania, on May 3rd, to finalize a real estate transaction with Count Dracula. Along the way, he observes the local culture and notes the unpunctual nature of Eastern European trains. He researched Transylvania and found it to be a wild, superstitious region. At the Golden Krone Hotel in Bistritz, the landlord and his wife are visibly frightened by the mention of Count Dracula and his castle, crossing themselves and refusing to speak further. The old lady gives Harker a crucifix, urging him not to travel on May 4th, the eve of St. George's Day, when evil things are said to have full sway.

Harker proceeds to the Borgo Pass by diligence. The other passengers express pity and make protective signs, whispering words like ""Satan,"" ""hell,"" ""witch,"" ""were-wolf,"" and ""vampire."" At the pass, a mysterious, tall, bearded driver with red, gleaming eyes, whom Harker suspects is the Count, meets him in a calèche drawn by black horses. The driver's strength is prodigious. The journey to the castle is eerie, with repeated turns over the same ground, howling dogs and wolves, and flickering blue flames that the driver briefly attends to. A ring of wolves surrounds the carriage, but the driver disperses them with an imperious gesture.

Harker arrives at a vast, ruined castle. The Count, a tall old man with a long white moustache, sharp teeth, and an ""extraordinary pallor,"" welcomes him with a cold, powerful handshake. Harker notices hairs in the Count's palms and his pointed ears. The Count claims to have already dined and does not join Harker for supper. Harker gives the Count a letter from his employer, Mr. Hawkins, regarding the purchase of a London estate. The Count expresses his desire to learn English customs and intonation to blend into London society, as he plans to move there. He speaks of his Szekely heritage, claiming descent from Attila and a long history of warfare.

Harker soon realizes he is a prisoner. He discovers there are no servants in the castle, leading him to believe the Count was the coach driver. He sees the Count crawl down the castle wall, face down, like a lizard. Harker attempts to explore the castle during the Count's absence and finds a locked door that he forces open, revealing a more comfortable wing. He later experiences a terrifying ""dream"" where three voluptuous women with sharp teeth approach him, intending to kiss his throat. The Count appears in a furious rage, claiming Harker as his own, and hurls one of the women away. The women then open a bag, from which a ""half-smothered child"" wails before they disappear.

Harker wakes in his own bed, his diary intact, but later finds the door to the room with the women forcibly closed. The Count makes Harker write three post-dated letters, implying he will be held captive until at least June 29th. Harker attempts to send secret shorthand letters to Mina and Mr. Hawkins via Szgany (gypsies) who arrive at the castle, but the Count intercepts and burns Mina's letter. Harker discovers his travel clothes and documents have been stolen. He then sees the Count leave the castle wearing his stolen clothes and carrying the ""terrible bag,"" realizing the Count intends to impersonate him and commit evil deeds. That night, Harker witnesses a woman in the courtyard crying for her child, followed by wolves entering and leaving, licking their lips.

Desperate, Harker resolves to escape. He climbs out his window and enters the Count's room, finding a heap of old gold and jewels. He discovers a secret passage leading to an old, ruined chapel, where he finds 50 wooden boxes of earth. In one of these boxes, he finds the Count, looking younger, with blood-stained lips, appearing gorged with blood. Harker strikes the Count with a shovel, gashing his forehead, but the Count's eyes blaze with ""basilisk horror,"" paralyzing Harker. The Count's body crumbles into dust. Harker hears the Szgany and Slovaks arriving to transport the boxes. He attempts to escape but finds himself trapped again. He realizes the Count has left the castle with the boxes. He contemplates suicide but resolves to try and scale the castle wall.

**Lucy Westenra's Illness and Death:**
Meanwhile, in England, Mina Murray and Lucy Westenra correspond. Lucy receives three marriage proposals in one day from Dr. John Seward, Quincey P. Morris, and Arthur Holmwood (Lord Godalming), accepting Arthur's. Mina learns Jonathan has been ill with ""brain fever"" in Buda-Pesth and travels there to marry him. Lucy begins sleepwalking again, and Mina discovers her on the East Cliff at Whitby, with ""something dark"" bending over her. Mina notices two small, red puncture marks on Lucy's throat.

A newspaper report details a severe storm in Whitby. A Russian schooner, the _Demeter_, arrives unsteered, with its dead captain lashed to the helm, a crucifix and beads around his wrists. An immense dog leaps from the ship and disappears. The ship's cargo consists of 50 wooden boxes of mould. The captain's log reveals the mysterious disappearance of his crew during the voyage, and his mate's belief that ""It"" was on board, eventually leading to the mate's suicide. The captain ties himself to the wheel with a crucifix before dying. Old Mr. Swales, a local, is found dead with a broken neck, a look of fear on his face. A dog howls mournfully at Lucy's mother's grave.

Lucy's health deteriorates rapidly. She becomes pale, languid, and suffers from breathing difficulties. Dr. Seward, her former suitor, consults his old master, Professor Van Helsing, a specialist in obscure diseases. Van Helsing diagnoses a severe loss of blood and performs a blood transfusion from Arthur to Lucy. He notices the puncture marks on Lucy's throat. Mrs. Westenra, Lucy's mother, unknowingly removes the protective garlic flowers Van Helsing placed in Lucy's room and opens the window, leading to a relapse. Van Helsing performs further transfusions, from himself and then from Quincey Morris.

Renfield, Dr. Seward's zoöphagous patient at the asylum, exhibits erratic behavior, linked to the Count's presence. He escapes to Carfax, the Count's newly purchased London estate next to the asylum, and speaks of serving his ""Master."" He later attacks Dr. Seward, licking his blood, proclaiming ""The blood is the life!""

Lucy's condition worsens. Her throat wounds disappear, but her teeth appear longer and sharper. She dies. Van Helsing, however, declares, ""It is only the beginning!"" He reveals that Lucy is ""Un-Dead"" and plans to perform a ritual to free her soul. He places garlic and a crucifix on her coffin.

**The Hunt for Dracula in London:**
Newspaper reports surface about children in Hampstead being lured away by a ""bloofer lady"" and found with small, punctured wounds on their throats, similar to Lucy's. Van Helsing reveals to Seward that these wounds were made by ""Miss Lucy!""

Van Helsing convinces Arthur and Quincey to join him and Seward in confronting the ""Un-Dead"" Lucy. They go to the churchyard at night. Van Helsing opens Lucy's coffin, which is empty. He explains he had placed garlic to prevent her from leaving, but removed it the previous night. They hide and witness Lucy, now a vampiric ""bloofer lady,"" with crimson lips and glowing eyes, bringing a child to the tomb. She flings the child aside and attempts to lure Arthur. Van Helsing repels her with a crucifix, and she retreats into the tomb.

The next night, the group returns. Arthur, with a stake and hammer, drives the stake through Lucy's heart. Her body writhes and screeches, but then becomes still. Lucy's face is restored to its former beauty and peace. Van Helsing then cuts off her head and fills her mouth with garlic, freeing her soul.

Jonathan Harker, having recovered from his illness, returns to London. He and Mina begin collating all the journals and letters. Jonathan sees the Count in London, looking younger, and recognizes him. Mina, after reading Jonathan's journal, realizes the full horror of their situation. Van Helsing explains the Count's powers and limitations, and the danger Mina faces due to the ""Vampire's baptism of blood."" He places a Sacred Wafer on Mina's forehead, which sears her flesh, leaving a red mark, symbolizing her ""unclean"" state but also a protection.

The group discovers that the Count has been distributing his earth-boxes (his ""lairs"") across London. They systematically locate and sterilize the boxes at Carfax, Piccadilly, Mile End, and Bermondsey by placing Sacred Wafer in them. During the search of the Piccadilly house, the Count appears. Harker attacks him with a Kukri knife, cutting his coat and causing money to fall out. The Count, enraged, escapes through a window and flees in a stable. He boasts that his revenge has just begun and that Mina and others will become his ""creatures.""

Renfield, who had been calm, has a final violent outburst, revealing that the Count had promised him ""lives"" (rats, dogs, cats) in exchange for worship. He describes the Count forcing Mina to drink his blood. Renfield then struggles with the Count, but is fatally injured and dies.

**The Pursuit to Transylvania:**
The group realizes the Count has fled London. Mina, through hypnotic trance induced by Van Helsing, reveals the Count is on a ship, the _Czarina Catherine_, heading for Varna, then up the Danube to Galatz. She deduces his plan to return to his castle via the Sereth and Bistritza rivers.

The group decides to pursue him. Lord Godalming and Jonathan Harker take a steam launch up the river. Dr. Seward and Quincey Morris follow on horseback along the riverbank. Van Helsing takes Mina by train and carriage towards the Borgo Pass, intending to reach Dracula's castle. Mina, despite her fear, insists on joining them, believing her hypnotic abilities will be crucial. She makes the men promise to kill her if she becomes fully vampiric.

During their journey, Mina's hypnotic trances become more difficult to induce, and her reports become vaguer. Van Helsing realizes the Count is trying to cut off her connection to him. He also notices Mina's growing lethargy and pallor.

Van Helsing and Mina reach the Borgo Pass. Mina, guided by an instinct, points to a by-road leading to the castle. Van Helsing finds three of the Count's vampiric ""sisters"" in tombs within the castle chapel. He performs the ritual on them, cutting off their heads and watching their bodies crumble to dust. He also places Sacred Wafer in Dracula's tomb, banishing him from it.

Jonathan, Godalming, Seward, and Morris race upriver and along the bank. They spot the Szgany with the last earth-box on a leiter-wagon, hurrying towards the castle as sunset approaches. A fierce confrontation ensues. Jonathan and Quincey fight their way to the cart. Jonathan throws the box to the ground. Quincey is mortally wounded by a gypsy knife. As the sun sets, Jonathan's Kukri knife shears through the Count's throat, and Quincey's bowie knife plunges into his heart. The Count's body crumbles into dust.

Quincey Morris, dying, points to Mina's forehead. As the red gleams of the setting sun fall upon her face, he declares, ""The snow is not more stainless than her forehead! The curse has passed away!"" He dies with a smile, a gallant gentleman. The gypsies flee, and the wolves follow them, leaving the group victorious."
Frankenstein-Mary Shelley,"The book begins with a series of letters written by Robert Walton, an English explorer, to his sister, Mrs. Saville, from St. Petersburgh and later Archangel. Walton, driven by an ardent desire for discovery, is embarking on a perilous voyage to the North Pole, hoping to find a passage, ascertain the secret of the magnet, and explore unknown lands. He recounts his early passion for seafaring, his brief attempt at poetry, and how an inheritance enabled his current expedition. He describes his preparations, including enduring hardships with whale-fishers and studying relevant sciences.

In Archangel, Walton expresses his loneliness and longing for a true friend to share his enthusiasm and support him in disappointment. He describes his courageous lieutenant and his gentle, kind master, recounting the master's past selfless act of giving up his beloved to a poorer rival. Walton's voyage is delayed by severe winter weather, but he remains resolute. He later writes, confirming his ship is safe and at a high latitude, with his men undeterred by the ice.

A strange incident occurs on July 31st when Walton's ship is surrounded by ice and fog. They witness a gigantic man in a sledge, drawn by dogs, speeding northward across the ice. The next morning, after the ice breaks, they discover another sledge on an ice fragment, containing a European man who is emaciated and nearly frozen. This stranger, who refuses to board until he learns their northern destination, faints but is revived. He is generally melancholy but shows moments of benevolence. When asked why he was on the ice, he replies, ""To seek one who fled from me,"" confirming the man he pursued traveled in the same manner, which Walton's lieutenant believes they saw. The stranger, whom Walton refers to as a ""dæmon,"" asks questions about the pursued sledge. Walton develops a strong affection and sympathy for the stranger.

On August 13th, the stranger, having recovered, notices Walton's enthusiasm for his own voyage of discovery. The stranger becomes distressed, crying and groaning, and then offers to tell his ""tale"" to warn Walton against the dangers of ambition and the pursuit of knowledge. Walton, intrigued and compassionate, agrees to listen, resolving to record the narrative.

The stranger, Victor Frankenstein, begins his story. He is a Genevese from a distinguished family. His father, Alphonse, married Caroline Beaufort, the daughter of his impoverished friend, whom he had rescued after her father's death. Victor was born in Naples, and at five years old, his mother adopted Elizabeth Lavenza, an orphaned Milanese noble's daughter, who became Victor's beloved companion and ""more than sister.""

Victor describes his childhood with Elizabeth and his close friend Henry Clerval, a merchant's son who loved chivalry and romance. Victor, however, was consumed by a thirst for knowledge, seeking the ""secrets of heaven and earth."" At thirteen, he discovered the works of Cornelius Agrippa, igniting a passion for alchemy, which his father dismissed as ""sad trash."" This dismissal only fueled Victor's avid study of Agrippa, Paracelsus, and Albertus Magnus. At fifteen, a violent thunderstorm, which shattered an oak tree, and a subsequent explanation of electricity and galvanism by a researcher, made Victor realize the futility of his alchemical studies. He abandoned them for mathematics, believing it to be a ""miraculous change"" to avert a looming ""storm.""

At seventeen, Victor's parents decided he should attend the University of Ingolstadt. Before his departure, Elizabeth contracted scarlet fever. His mother, nursing her, contracted the disease and died, first joining Victor's and Elizabeth's hands and expressing her hope for their future union. After a period of mourning, Victor departed for Ingolstadt, leaving Elizabeth to care for his younger brothers. Clerval, unable to obtain his father's permission, could not accompany him.

At Ingolstadt, Victor met M. Krempe, a gruff natural philosophy professor who scorned his alchemical studies. However, M. Waldman, a benevolent chemistry professor, delivered a lecture praising modern chemistry's ""almost unlimited powers,"" which re-ignited Victor's scientific ardor. Victor resolved to explore the ""deepest mysteries of creation"" and became a dedicated student under M. Waldman's guidance.

For two years, Victor immersed himself in natural philosophy and chemistry, making rapid progress and earning esteem. Instead of returning home, he became obsessed with the ""principle of life."" He studied anatomy and observed decay in charnel-houses, eventually discovering the ""cause of generation and life"" and the ability to ""bestow animation upon lifeless matter."" He decided to create a human-like being, resolving to make it of ""gigantic stature"" (eight feet tall) due to the difficulty of working with minute parts. He spent months collecting materials from gruesome sources, neglecting his health and friends, driven by a ""frantic impulse"" despite his loathing for the ""filthy creation.""

On a ""dreary night of November,"" Victor animated his creation. However, the creature's ""dull yellow eye"" opening and its convulsive motions filled him with ""breathless horror and disgust."" He fled his apartment. He had a nightmare about Elizabeth turning into his dead mother. He awoke to see the creature standing by his bed, reaching out to him. Victor escaped and spent the night in the courtyard. The next morning, he encountered Henry Clerval, who had just arrived in Ingolstadt. Overjoyed, Victor led Clerval to his apartment, where he discovered the creature had vanished. The relief, combined with the preceding horror, caused Victor to fall into a nervous fever that lasted several months. Clerval nursed him, concealing the severity of his illness from his family. During his delirium, Victor raved about the monster.

Upon recovering, Victor received a letter from Elizabeth, expressing concern over his long silence and updating him on family matters, including the return of Justine Moritz, a beloved servant girl, to their household. Victor, still repulsed by his scientific past, joined Clerval in studying oriental languages, finding solace in the distraction. His planned return to Geneva was delayed until spring. During a walking tour with Clerval, Victor's spirits were restored by nature and his friend's companionship.

However, upon his return, Victor received a letter from his father informing him that his youngest brother, William, had been brutally murdered by strangulation in Plainpalais. A valuable miniature of Victor's mother, which Elizabeth had given William, was missing. Victor, visiting the murder scene during a thunderstorm, saw the ""gigantic stature"" and ""deformity"" of his creature, realizing it was William's murderer. He decided to remain silent, fearing he would be deemed mad if he revealed the truth. Back home, he learned that Justine Moritz had been accused of the murder, as the miniature was found in her pocket. Victor, convinced of her innocence, was horrified.

At Justine's trial, Victor suffered immense anguish, knowing his creation was the true culprit. Despite Justine's calm demeanor and her declaration of innocence, circumstantial evidence—her presence near the body, her confused answers, and the discovery of the miniature in her pocket—led to her condemnation. Elizabeth passionately defended Justine, testifying to her good character, but public indignation prevailed. Justine, under pressure from her confessor, confessed to a lie to gain absolution. Victor and Elizabeth visited her in prison, where Justine reiterated her innocence before her execution. Victor was consumed by remorse, recognizing himself as the ""true murderer"" and the cause of William's and Justine's deaths.

Victor fell into deep despair, shunning society and contemplating suicide, but was restrained by concern for his remaining family. He was filled with hatred and a burning desire for revenge against the monster. His father and Elizabeth were also deeply affected by the tragedies. Elizabeth, in particular, expressed her horror at the injustice and her fear of the murderer escaping. Victor, seeking relief, journeyed to the Alpine valleys of Chamounix, where the sublime scenery offered some temporary solace.

On Montanvert, Victor confronted the creature. Victor cursed him, calling him ""Devil"" and ""vile insect,"" but the creature calmly reasoned, explaining his misery and isolation, and demanding that Victor create a female companion for him. He threatened Victor with ""inextinguishable hatred"" and vowed to be with him on his ""wedding-night"" if his demand was refused. Victor, moved by the creature's arguments and a sense of duty, reluctantly agreed, on the condition that the creature and his mate would leave Europe forever and dwell in the wilds of South America. The creature swore to this and departed.

Victor returned to Geneva, haggard and wild, resolving to fulfill his ""abhorred task"" to protect his family. His father, noticing Victor's continued melancholy, suggested he marry Elizabeth immediately. Victor, remembering the creature's threat, was horrified by the idea of immediate marriage but also feared greater revenge if he postponed it. He agreed to the marriage in ten days, believing he was sealing his own death. He wrote to Elizabeth, promising to reveal a ""dreadful secret"" the day after their wedding.

Preparations for the wedding were made, and Victor took precautions, carrying a pistol and dagger. On the wedding day, Elizabeth was melancholy, sensing evil. After the ceremony, they departed for Evian by boat, planning to continue to Villa Lavenza. Victor experienced a fleeting moment of happiness, but his fears revived as they landed.

At the inn in Evian, Victor was anxious and watchful, pistol in hand. He persuaded Elizabeth to retire to her room. While he searched the house, he heard a ""shrill and dreadful scream"" from Elizabeth's room. He rushed in to find her ""lifeless and inanimate,"" strangled. As he grieved, he saw the monster at the window, grinning and pointing at Elizabeth's corpse. Victor fired his pistol, but the creature escaped into the lake.

Victor collapsed from exhaustion and fever. He realized the creature's threat had been fulfilled, and he was responsible for the deaths of William, Justine, Clerval, and now Elizabeth. He returned to Geneva, where his father, upon hearing the news of Elizabeth's death, died in Victor's arms a few days later. Victor descended into madness and was imprisoned for months, believed to be insane.

Upon regaining his reason, Victor was consumed by a maddening rage and a singular purpose: revenge. He went to a criminal judge, accusing the creature and demanding his apprehension. He recounted his story, but the magistrate, though initially attentive, dismissed it as a ""tale of spirits and supernatural events"" and deemed pursuit impractical due to the creature's powers.

Victor, enraged, left the magistrate and resolved to pursue the creature himself. He visited the graves of his family and swore an oath of vengeance. A ""fiendish laugh"" answered him, and the creature's voice whispered, ""I am satisfied, miserable wretch! You have determined to live, and I am satisfied."" Victor pursued the creature for many months across Europe, Tartary, and Russia, enduring extreme hardships. The creature sometimes left taunting inscriptions and clues to guide Victor, fearing he would despair and die.

The chase led them to the ""everlasting ices of the north."" Victor procured a sledge and dogs, gaining on the creature. He learned from villagers that the ""gigantic monster"" had taken trained dogs and provisions and sailed across the frozen sea. Victor, despite temporary despair, continued the pursuit across the Frozen Ocean. After three weeks, exhausted and near death on a diminishing ice raft, he spotted Walton's vessel and was rescued.

Victor, now on his deathbed, tells Walton his task of vengeance is unfulfilled. He asks Walton to swear to pursue and destroy the creature if he dies, warning him against the creature's eloquence and malice.

Walton continues his letters, describing Frankenstein's declining health and intense emotional state. He admits that the creature's letters (found in Victor's papers) and the sighting of the monster from his ship gave him greater conviction in Victor's story. Frankenstein, believing his only peace is in death, urges Walton to avoid ambition and seek tranquility.

On September 5th, Walton faces a mutiny from his crew, who demand he turn the ship south if freed from the ice. Frankenstein, roused by this, delivers an impassioned speech, urging the men to continue their glorious expedition and not return as cowards. The men are moved but still hesitant. Walton, on September 7th, reluctantly consents to return south if the ship is freed.

On September 11th, the ice breaks, and a passage south opens. The sailors rejoice. Frankenstein, hearing they are returning, refuses to abandon his purpose of vengeance, believing it assigned by Heaven. He attempts to rise but faints and is declared to have only hours to live. On his deathbed, Frankenstein justifies his actions, including refusing to create a companion for the creature, and renews his request for Walton to destroy the monster. He warns Walton against ambition and then dies peacefully.

Walton, entering Frankenstein's cabin, finds the gigantic creature hanging over the coffin, expressing profound grief and horror. The creature calls Frankenstein his ""victim"" and declares his crimes ""consummated."" Walton, initially moved by compassion, is rekindled with indignation, accusing the creature of hypocrisy. The creature explains his remorse and agony, stating his heart was susceptible to love but was wrenched to vice by misery and rejection. He admits his ""demoniacal design"" became an ""insatiable passion"" after Elizabeth's death. He acknowledges his crimes but also questions the injustice of mankind's hatred towards him. He states his work is complete and he will not cause further mischief. He plans to travel to the ""most northern extremity of the globe,"" build a funeral pyre, and consume himself to ashes, so that no trace of his existence remains and no one can create another like him. He desires death as his only consolation. He bids farewell to Walton, the ""last of humankind,"" and leaps from the cabin window onto the ice raft, disappearing into the darkness and distance."
Great Expectations-Charles Dickens,"The plot of the provided text, ""Great Expectations,"" unfolds as follows:

**Chapters I-III: Pip's Childhood Encounters and the Secret Burden**
The story begins with Pip, an orphan whose full name is Philip Pirrip, but who has always called himself Pip. He lives with his older sister, Mrs. Joe Gargery, who raised him ""by hand"" (implying physical abuse), and her kind husband, Joe Gargery, the village blacksmith. Pip's only knowledge of his deceased parents and five infant brothers comes from their tombstones in the bleak marsh country churchyard.

One raw afternoon in the churchyard, a terrifying escaped convict, with a great iron on his leg, accosts Pip. The man threatens Pip with violence, including cutting his throat, and demands food (""wittles"") and a file. He also mentions a more terrible ""young man"" who is hiding with him. Terrified, Pip promises to bring these items to an old Battery on the marshes early the next morning.

Back home, Pip hides a slice of bread and butter in his trousers for the convict. His sister's harsh temper is evident, as she physically abuses both Pip and Joe. Joe, a mild-mannered man, is Pip's only comfort. Pip's conscience is burdened by the impending theft and the convict's threats. Later that evening, after being forced to drink foul tar-water by his sister, Pip overhears Joe and Mrs. Joe discussing escaped convicts from the ""Hulks"" (prison-ships). Pip is sent to bed in mortal terror, knowing he must rob his sister's pantry.

At dawn on Christmas Eve, Pip steals bread, cheese, mincemeat, brandy, a meat bone, and a pork pie from the pantry, along with a file from Joe's forge. He then runs to the misty marshes. Lost in the fog, he first encounters a second man, also a convict with an iron on his leg, whom he realizes is the ""young man"" the first convict spoke of. This second man curses at Pip and stumbles away into the mist. Pip then finds his original convict, who is shivering and ravenously eats the food. Pip timidly mentions seeing the ""young man."" The convict, enraged, stuffs the remaining food into his jacket, takes the file, and limps off to hunt the other convict, muttering curses. Pip, afraid, slips away and runs home.

**Chapters IV-VI: Christmas Day and the Convict's Confession**
Pip returns home expecting to be discovered but finds his sister busy preparing for Christmas dinner. Guests arrive: Mr. Wopsle (the church clerk), Mr. and Mrs. Hubble, and Uncle Pumblechook (a cornchandler who takes credit for Pip's upbringing). During dinner, Pip is subjected to constant criticism and moralizing, particularly from Pumblechook, who calls him ungrateful. Joe tries to comfort Pip with extra gravy. Pip is terrified when Uncle Pumblechook drinks the brandy he had refilled with tar-water, leading to a violent coughing fit and Pumblechook's temporary madness. Pip believes he has murdered him. Later, the pork pie is brought out, and Pip, knowing he stole it, runs from the house, only to run into a party of soldiers.

The soldiers explain they need the blacksmith to mend handcuffs for two escaped convicts. Joe agrees to the task. Pip realizes the handcuffs are not for him. The sergeant mentions they will ""close in upon 'em about dusk."" Joe mends the handcuffs, and Pip, Joe, and Mr. Wopsle are allowed to accompany the soldiers on the hunt. On the marshes, they hear shouts and find the two convicts fighting in a ditch. Pip's convict declares he ""took him!"" and ""give him up to you!"" referring to the other. The other convict, badly bruised, accuses Pip's convict of attempted murder. Pip's convict, now identified as Provis, boasts of escaping the prison-ship and hunting down the other man (Compeyson). Torches are lit, and Provis sees Pip, giving him an unreadable look. Cannon fire signals the convicts are expected on board the Hulks.

At a hut, Provis confesses to the sergeant that he stole food and a pie from the blacksmith's. Joe confirms his wife missed a pie and, with a ""saving remembrance of Mrs. Joe,"" tells Provis he is welcome to it, as he wouldn't want him to starve. Provis is then taken to the Hulk, which Pip describes as a ""wicked Noah's ark."" Pip is relieved the theft is resolved but feels guilty about deceiving Joe. At home, Joe tells the visitors about the confession, and Pumblechook invents a fantastical story of the convict's entry. Pip is sent to bed, still burdened by his secret and too cowardly to confess to Joe.

**Chapters VII-IX: Miss Havisham, Estella, and Pip's Shame**
Pip's formal education at Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt's evening school is rudimentary, but Biddy, the great-aunt's granddaughter, helps him learn. Joe reveals his own difficult, abusive childhood, explaining why he never went to school. He married Pip's sister, who is ""given to government"" (controlling them). Mrs. Joe announces Miss Havisham wants Pip to ""play"" at her house. Pumblechook takes credit for this opportunity. Pip is cleaned and dressed, then taken by Pumblechook to Miss Havisham's.

At Miss Havisham's, a dismal, barred house called Satis House, Estella, a beautiful and proud young lady, lets Pip in but dismisses Pumblechook. Pip finds Miss Havisham in a faded white bridal gown, with clocks stopped at twenty minutes to nine. She declares her heart ""Broken!"" and tells Pip to ""Play!"" Estella calls Pip a ""common labouring-boy"" and disdains his coarse hands and thick boots. Pip overhears Miss Havisham telling Estella, ""You can break his heart."" Miss Havisham asks Pip what he thinks of Estella, and he whispers she is proud, pretty, and insulting. He is told to return in six days. Estella gives him food ""dog-like."" Pip, humiliated, cries in the brewery yard. He has a terrifying hallucination of Miss Havisham hanging. Estella finds him and taunts him for crying.

Pip returns home and lies about his visit to his sister and Pumblechook, inventing stories of black velvet coaches, gold plates, and immense dogs. Joe is amazed, but Pip feels guilty. He confesses his lies to Joe, who, though dismayed, advises him that ""lies is lies"" and not the way to become ""uncommon."" Pip is still troubled by Estella's contempt.

**Chapters X-XIV: The Stranger at the Pub and Pip's Great Expectations**
At the Three Jolly Bargemen, Pip encounters a ""secret-looking man"" who stirs his rum with a file, which Pip recognizes as Joe's. The man gives Pip a shilling, wrapped with two one-pound notes. Joe returns the notes, but the man is gone. Pip is haunted by the encounter.

Pip returns to Miss Havisham's. Estella slaps him. He meets Mr. Jaggers, a burly, suspicious lawyer. Miss Havisham shows Pip a decaying room with a bride-cake, saying it's where she will be laid when dead. She makes Pip push her in a chair. Her relatives (Camilla, Cousin Raymond, Sarah Pocket) visit, flattering her but revealing their cupidity. Miss Havisham tells them they will ""feast upon me"" when she dies. She reveals it's her birthday, and the bride-cake was brought on that day. Pip and Estella play cards. Pip is fed like a dog. Pip fights the ""pale young gentleman"" in the garden and wins. Estella allows Pip to kiss her cheek, but he feels it's given to a ""common boy.""

Pip's regular visits to Miss Havisham continue for months. She asks if Estella grows prettier and murmurs, ""Break their hearts my pride and hope."" Pip confides in Biddy, who has become neat and thoughtful. Biddy suggests Pip is happier as he is, but he insists he is ""disgusted with my calling."" He tells Biddy he wants to be a gentleman for Estella. Biddy wisely questions his motives. Pip is angered by Orlick's admiration for Biddy.

Miss Havisham decides Pip should be apprenticed at once and asks Joe to bring his indentures. Mrs. Joe is furious. Joe and Pip go to Miss Havisham's. Joe, nervous, addresses Pip instead of Miss Havisham. Miss Havisham gives Pip twenty-five guineas as a premium, telling him to give it to Joe. Joe, deeply moved, refuses compensation for losing Pip, saying Pip is ""hearty welcome"" to go free. Jaggers, present at the meeting, is impressed by Joe's integrity. Pip is then formally bound apprentice to Joe. Pumblechook takes credit for Pip's good fortune. Pip feels miserable, ashamed of his home and trade, and haunted by the fear of Estella seeing him as a common blacksmith.

**Chapters XV-XVII: Orlick's Attack and Biddy's Wisdom**
Pip's formal education ends. He tries to teach Joe, but only to make him ""less ignorant and common"" for his own sake. Joe, however, remains ""awful dull."" Orlick, Joe's journeyman, demands a half-holiday and quarrels fiercely with Mrs. Joe, then fights Joe. Joe easily defeats him. Mrs. Joe collapses.

Pip visits Miss Havisham annually. The unchanging house reinforces his shame of home. He notices Biddy's growing refinement and intelligence. He confesses to Biddy his desire to be a gentleman for Estella's sake. Biddy questions his motives, suggesting Estella is ""not worth gaining over."" Pip, though frustrated, recognizes Biddy's wisdom. Orlick, who dislikes Pip, expresses admiration for Biddy, making Pip indignant.

Mrs. Joe, after her attack, is very ill, her sight, hearing, memory, and speech impaired. She uses a slate to communicate. Biddy becomes a blessing to the household, caring for Mrs. Joe. Biddy solves a mystery: Mrs. Joe repeatedly draws a ""T"" on her slate, which Biddy realizes signifies Orlick, who she identifies by his hammer. Mrs. Joe, surprisingly, shows great anxiety to be on good terms with Orlick. Pip suspects Orlick or the stranger with the file (the man from the pub) of the attack.

**Chapters XVIII-XXI: Pip's Great Expectations Revealed and London Life**
Four years into his apprenticeship, Pip is at the Three Jolly Bargemen when Mr. Jaggers, a London lawyer, appears. Jaggers, whom Pip recognizes from Miss Havisham's, announces that Pip has ""great expectations"" and will come into a ""handsome property."" He is to be removed from his current life and ""brought up as a gentleman."" The benefactor's name is a secret, and Pip is forbidden to inquire. Jaggers will be his guardian. He suggests Mr. Matthew Pocket (Miss Havisham's cousin) as his tutor. Jaggers gives Pip twenty guineas for new clothes. Joe, deeply moved, refuses compensation for losing Pip, saying Pip is ""hearty welcome"" to go free. Jaggers, impressed, then offers Joe compensation, but Joe angrily refuses, asserting his independence.

Pip leaves for London, feeling ashamed of Joe and his humble origins. He is to stay at Barnard's Inn with Herbert Pocket, the ""pale young gentleman"" he fought at Satis House. They recognize each other and laugh, becoming friends. Herbert tells Pip Miss Havisham's story: she was a rich heiress whose lover, Compeyson, defrauded her and left her at the altar. She then stopped all the clocks and lived in perpetual decay. Estella is her adopted daughter, raised to wreak revenge on men. Herbert also reveals his own aspirations as a ""capitalist—an Insurer of Ships"" but admits he is currently a clerk with no income. Pip confides his love for Estella to Herbert. Herbert, in turn, reveals he is secretly engaged to Clara Barley.

Pip finds Barnard's Inn dingy. He meets Drummle and Startop, other students of Mr. Pocket. Mr. Pocket is a kind but distracted tutor, whose wife, Mrs. Pocket, is obsessed with titles and neglects her children. Pip observes the chaotic household. He starts rowing on the Thames for exercise.

**Chapters XXII-XXVII: Wemmick's Walworth, Jaggers's Secrets, and Estella's Return**
Pip visits Wemmick at his home in Walworth, a miniature ""Castle"" with a drawbridge, moat, and cannon, where he lives with his deaf ""Aged Parent."" Wemmick's home life is a stark contrast to his professional demeanor at Jaggers's office. Pip confides in Wemmick his desire to secretly help Herbert financially. Wemmick agrees, arranging for Pip to invest in Clarriker's business to secure a partnership for Herbert, without Herbert's knowledge. Pip pays half of his initial five hundred pounds for this. Herbert is overjoyed when the opportunity arises, unaware of Pip's involvement.

Pip continues to be tormented by Estella. She returns from France, more beautiful and womanly. Pip visits Miss Havisham and Estella, who is as proud and cold as ever. Estella tells Pip she deceives and entraps ""many others,—all of them but you."" Miss Havisham, with a ""ravenous intensity,"" encourages Estella to ""Love her, love her, love her! If she wounds you, love her. If she tears your heart to pieces... love her!"" Pip realizes Estella is meant to be Miss Havisham's instrument of revenge.

At a Finches of the Grove club dinner, Drummle toasts Estella, enraging Pip. Drummle later produces a note from Estella confirming she danced with him. Pip confronts Estella about encouraging Drummle, calling him a ""boor."" Estella replies that ""Moths, and all sorts of ugly creatures... hover about a lighted candle. Can the candle help it?"" She admits she deceives others but not Pip. She then reveals she is going to marry Drummle. Pip is devastated.

**Chapters XXVIII-XXXI: The Convict's Return and Pip's Ruin**
Pip is twenty-three and living in the Temple. Herbert is away. On a stormy night, a rough-looking man arrives at Pip's chambers. Pip recognizes him as his convict, Provis (Abel Magwitch). Magwitch reveals he is Pip's secret benefactor, having made his fortune in Australia and returned to England at great risk (it is a capital offense for a transported convict to return) to see ""his gentleman."" Pip is horrified and repulsed, realizing his ""great expectations"" come from a criminal. He feels his life is ""wrecked.""

Magwitch tells his life story: a life of crime, ""In jail and out of jail."" He reveals he met Compeyson, a gentleman swindler, at Epsom races. Compeyson, who was Miss Havisham's false lover, used Magwitch in his schemes. Magwitch also tells of Arthur, Compeyson's dying accomplice, who was haunted by visions of a mad woman in white with a shroud. Magwitch explains he was given a harsher sentence than Compeyson due to Compeyson's gentlemanly appearance and Magwitch's criminal record. He escaped the prison-ship and hunted Compeyson on the marshes, smashing his face. Herbert reveals that Arthur was Miss Havisham's half-brother, and Compeyson was her lover.

Pip is now burdened by Magwitch's presence and the danger he is in. He locks Magwitch in Herbert's room. He realizes Miss Havisham's role in his life was a ""mere dream,"" and Estella was never meant for him. He feels he deserted Joe for a criminal.

**Chapters XXXII-XXXV: The Escape Plan, Orlick's Attack, and Miss Havisham's Fire**
Pip and Herbert decide Magwitch must be smuggled out of England. Pip receives an anonymous letter, urging him to come alone to the sluice-house on the marshes for information about ""your uncle Provis."" Despite his burned arm (from the fire at Miss Havisham's), Pip feels compelled to go. At the Blue Boar, he encounters Drummle, who hints at his relationship with Estella.

At the sluice-house, Pip is ambushed by Orlick, who ties him up and reveals he was the lurker on the stairs. Orlick confesses to attacking Mrs. Joe with Magwitch's filed-off leg-iron, blaming Pip for his misfortunes and for coming ""betwixt me and a young woman I liked"" (Biddy). Orlick intends to kill Pip and dispose of his body in the limekiln. Just as Orlick is about to strike, Herbert and Startop burst in, having followed Pip after finding his note and becoming alarmed. Orlick escapes.

Pip, Herbert, and Startop return to London. Pip is nursed by Herbert. Herbert reveals more of Magwitch's past: Estella's mother was a jealous woman, tried for murder (defended by Jaggers and acquitted), who swore to destroy her child (Magwitch's daughter) and vanished. Magwitch, fearing she would be executed for the child's death, hid himself from the trial. Herbert then reveals the shocking truth: Magwitch is Estella's father.

Pip confronts Jaggers, who, through a series of hypothetical ""cases,"" confirms Pip's deductions about Estella's parentage and her mother's murder trial. Jaggers explains he saved the child (Estella) by giving her to Miss Havisham to adopt, keeping her hidden from her parents, who were unknown to each other. Jaggers also reveals that Estella's mother is his housekeeper, Molly, whose strong wrists bear scars from the struggle.

Pip returns to Miss Havisham's. He confesses he knows his benefactor is not her and that he knows Estella's parentage. He asks Miss Havisham to provide money for Herbert's partnership, which she does. Pip tells her he loves Estella, but Estella, cold and proud, says she has ""no heart"" and is what Miss Havisham made her. Estella confirms she is marrying Drummle. Miss Havisham, filled with remorse, collapses, crying, ""What have I done!"" Pip leaves her, then returns to find her engulfed in flames. He bravely puts out the fire, suffering severe burns to his hands and arm. Miss Havisham, in her delirium, repeatedly says, ""What have I done!"" and ""Take the pencil and write under my name, ‘I forgive her!’""

**Chapters XXXVI-LIX: Magwitch's Death, Pip's Ruin, and a New Beginning**
Magwitch is gravely ill in prison. Pip visits him daily, reading to him and comforting him. Jaggers's application for a trial postponement is refused. Magwitch is tried, found guilty of returning from transportation, and sentenced to death. Pip writes petitions to save him. Magwitch, near death, tells Pip he is content, having seen his ""boy"" become a gentleman. Pip reveals to Magwitch that his daughter, Estella, is alive, beautiful, and that Pip loves her. Magwitch, with a last faint effort, raises Pip's hand to his lips and dies peacefully. Pip prays, ""O Lord, be merciful to him a sinner!""

Pip, now deeply in debt and ill, is arrested for his outstanding debts. Joe, having received a letter about Pip's illness, comes to London and nurses him back to health, paying off all his debts. Pip, filled with remorse for his ingratitude, tries to confess to Joe, but Joe, with simple dignity, says their friendship is eternal and they should not dwell on ""unnecessary subjects."" Joe then leaves a letter for Pip, saying he has ""departured"" because Pip is well again and will do better without him. Enclosed is the receipt for Pip's debts, paid by Joe.

Pip, humbled and repentant, resolves to go to Biddy and ask her to marry him. He sells all his possessions to pay his creditors. He returns to his village, where the Blue Boar is now cold to him. He finds Satis House being sold for demolition. He goes to the forge, where he finds Joe and Biddy, arm in arm. Biddy, in a burst of happiness, announces, ""It’s my wedding-day!... and I am married to Joe!"" Pip is thankful he never confessed his hope to marry Biddy. He blesses their union, thanks them for their kindness, and tells them he is going abroad to work and repay his debts. He asks them to tell their future child (named Pip) that he honored them.

Pip joins Herbert in Clarriker and Co. in the East, working hard and living frugally to pay his debts. Many years later, Clarriker reveals to Herbert that Pip was his secret benefactor. Herbert is amazed, and their friendship remains strong.

Eleven years later, Pip returns to his village. He finds Joe hale and strong, with a child named Pip, whom they named for him. Pip talks with Biddy, who is now a schoolmistress. Biddy asks if he still frets for Estella. Pip says the ""poor dream... has all gone by."" He then secretly revisits the ruined garden of Satis House. He finds Estella there, greatly changed, her beauty's freshness gone but with a ""saddened, softened light"" in her eyes. She tells him the garden is her only remaining possession and is to be built on. She admits she has ""often thought of you"" and that suffering has taught her to understand his heart. She hopes she has been ""bent and broken... into a better shape."" She asks him to say they are friends. Pip agrees, and Estella says, ""And will continue friends apart."" They leave the ruined place, and Pip sees ""no shadow of another parting from her."""

**ACT I**

**SCENE I – Elsinore. A Platform before the Castle. Night.**
The play opens on a cold, dark night at Elsinore Castle. Francisco, a sentry, is relieved by Bernardo. Bernardo asks if Francisco had a quiet watch, to which Francisco replies, ""Not a mouse stirring."" Bernardo then asks Francisco to hasten Horatio and Marcellus, who are also on watch. Horatio and Marcellus soon arrive. Marcellus explains that Horatio, a scholar, has been entreated to join them because he disbelieves their account of a ""dreaded sight"" they have twice witnessed. Bernardo recounts seeing an apparition resembling the deceased King Hamlet. As he speaks, the Ghost appears again, looking exactly like the dead king, armed. Horatio is terrified and wonders, charging the Ghost to speak. The Ghost stalks away without a word. Horatio, now convinced, notes the Ghost wore the same armor as when King Hamlet combated the ambitious Norway. Marcellus adds that the Ghost has appeared twice before at the same hour. Horatio fears this ""bodes some strange eruption to our state,"" recalling omens before Julius Caesar's fall in Rome. The Ghost re-enters. Horatio attempts to speak to it again, asking if it has a voice, if there's good to be done, if it knows the country's fate, or if it has ""uphoarded... extorted treasure."" Before it can speak, the cock crows, and the Ghost starts ""like a guilty thing"" and vanishes. Horatio explains that spirits flee at the cock's crow, which heralds the morning. Seeing the dawn, Horatio suggests they tell young Hamlet what they've seen, believing the Ghost, though dumb to them, will speak to him. They exit.

**SCENE II – A Room of State in the Palace.**
King Claudius and Queen Gertrude enter, accompanied by Polonius, Hamlet, Laertes, and attendants. The King addresses the court, acknowledging the recent death of his brother, King Hamlet, but stating that discretion has tempered grief. He announces his marriage to Gertrude, his ""sometime sister, now our queen,"" a decision with which the court's ""better wisdoms"" have concurred. Laertes requests leave to return to France, having come to Denmark for the King's coronation. Polonius, Laertes' father, confirms he has reluctantly given his consent. The King grants Laertes' request.
The King then turns to Hamlet, calling him ""my cousin Hamlet, and my son."" Hamlet mutters an aside: ""A little more than kin, and less than kind."" The King asks why Hamlet remains gloomy. Hamlet replies he is ""too much i'the sun."" The Queen urges Hamlet to cast off his mourning and not seek his father in the dust, reminding him that death is common. Hamlet agrees it is common, but insists his grief is genuine and internal, far exceeding outward show. The King praises Hamlet's filial duty but calls his persistent sorrow ""unmanly grief"" and ""impious stubbornness."" He urges Hamlet to think of him as a father, noting Hamlet is ""most immediate to our throne."" The Queen asks Hamlet to stay in Denmark and not return to Wittenberg. Hamlet agrees to obey. The King expresses joy at Hamlet's ""gentle and unforc'd accord,"" promising celebratory cannon fire. The King, Queen, and court exit, leaving Hamlet alone.
Hamlet delivers a soliloquy, expressing his despair and suicidal thoughts, lamenting that God has forbidden self-slaughter. He describes the world as an ""unweeded garden"" and expresses disgust at his mother's hasty marriage to his uncle, less than two months after his father's death. He contrasts his father, ""Hyperion to a satyr,"" with Claudius, and his mother's swift transition from a Niobe-like mourner to marrying his uncle. He vows to hold his tongue.
Horatio, Bernardo, and Marcellus enter. Hamlet greets Horatio, his fellow student from Wittenberg, and Marcellus. He questions their presence in Elsinore. Horatio states he came for King Hamlet's funeral, which Hamlet bitterly corrects to his mother's wedding, noting the ""funeral bak'd meats Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables."" Horatio then reveals they saw the Ghost of King Hamlet. Hamlet is astonished and questions them closely about its appearance. They confirm it was armed, pale, and had a grizzled beard. Hamlet resolves to join their watch that night, instructing them to keep the sighting secret, and hinting at ""foul play.""

**SCENE III – A Room in Polonius’s House.**
Laertes prepares to depart for France, advising his sister Ophelia about Hamlet's affections. He warns her that Hamlet's love is fleeting, ""a violet in the youth of primy nature,"" and that as a prince, Hamlet cannot choose a wife for himself, as the ""safety and the health of the whole state"" depend on his choice. He urges her to protect her honor and be wary of Hamlet's songs and desires. Ophelia promises to heed his advice but playfully warns him not to be a hypocritical pastor who shows her the ""thorny way to heaven"" while treading the ""primrose path of dalliance"" himself.
Polonius enters, chastising Laertes for delaying his departure and offering him a series of precepts: be thoughtful, not vulgar, keep tried friends close, avoid quarrels but fight well if in one, listen more than speak, dress well but not gaudily, neither borrow nor lend, and above all, ""To thine ownself be true."" Laertes bids farewell to Ophelia, reminding her of his advice. Ophelia assures him it's locked in her memory.
After Laertes exits, Polonius questions Ophelia about what Laertes said regarding Hamlet. Polonius reveals he has heard of Hamlet's recent private visits and ""tenders of his affection"" to Ophelia. He dismisses Hamlet's affections as ""springes to catch woodcocks,"" not genuine love, and commands Ophelia to ""slander any leisure moment"" by not speaking or talking with Lord Hamlet. Ophelia, obediently, agrees.

**SCENE IV – The Platform. Night.**
Hamlet, Horatio, and Marcellus are on watch. It is very cold. Trumpets and ordnance sound from within the castle, indicating the King is holding a ""rouse"" (drinking bout). Hamlet criticizes this custom as ""more honour'd in the breach than the observance."" The Ghost enters. Hamlet, addressing it as ""Hamlet, King, father: Royal Dane,"" demands to know why his ""canoniz'd bones"" have burst their ""cerements"" and why it revisits the earth. The Ghost beckons Hamlet to follow it alone. Horatio and Marcellus warn Hamlet not to go, fearing it might lead him to the cliff or madness. Hamlet, valuing his life ""at a pin's fee"" and his soul as immortal, insists on following. When they try to restrain him, Hamlet breaks free, threatening to make a ""ghost of him that lets me."" He follows the Ghost.

**SCENE V – A More Remote Part of the Platform. Night.**
The Ghost leads Hamlet to a secluded area. Hamlet demands it speak. The Ghost reveals itself as King Hamlet's spirit, doomed to walk the night and ""fast in fires"" by day until its ""foul crimes"" are purged. It states it is forbidden to tell the secrets of its ""prison-house"" but commands Hamlet to ""Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder."" Hamlet is shocked. The Ghost explains that the official story of his death by a serpent's sting in his orchard is false. The ""serpent that did sting thy father's life Now wears his crown""—Hamlet's uncle, Claudius. The Ghost recounts how Claudius, with ""witchcraft of his wit"" and ""traitorous gifts,"" seduced Gertrude, winning her to his ""shameful lust."" He describes Claudius pouring ""juice of cursed hebenon"" into his ears while he slept, causing a swift, leperous death. Thus, King Hamlet was ""Of life, of crown, of queen, at once despatch'd,"" dying unshriven and with his sins unabsolved. The Ghost urges Hamlet to avenge him but warns him not to ""taint thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive Against thy mother aught: leave her to Heaven."" As the glow-worm fades, signaling dawn, the Ghost bids Hamlet ""Adieu, adieu, adieu! remember me"" and exits.
Hamlet, overwhelmed, vows to erase all other memories and dedicate his brain to the Ghost's commandment. Horatio and Marcellus call out, searching for him. Hamlet, feigning wildness, tells them he has seen a ""wonderful"" thing but refuses to reveal it, making them swear on his sword never to speak of what they've seen. The Ghost's voice from beneath the ground echoes ""Swear."" Hamlet adds a further oath: they must never, no matter how strangely he behaves (as he ""perchance, hereafter shall think meet To put an antick disposition on""), hint that they know anything about him or the night's events. The Ghost again cries ""Swear."" Hamlet, calling the Ghost a ""perturbèd spirit,"" thanks his friends and exits with them, lamenting, ""The time is out of joint;--O cursèd spite, That ever I was born to set it right!""

**ACT II**

**SCENE I – A Room in Polonius’s House.**
Ophelia enters, affrighted, to Polonius. She describes Hamlet's strange visit: his doublet unbraced, pale, knees knocking, a piteous look. He took her wrist, gazed at her face as if to draw it, sighed profoundly, and then left, walking out the door with his eyes fixed on her. Polonius concludes Hamlet is ""Mad for thy love."" Ophelia confirms that, as Polonius commanded, she has ""repel[led] his letters, and denied His access to me."" Polonius believes this rejection caused Hamlet's madness and decides they must tell the King.

**SCENE II – A Room in the Castle.**
The King and Queen welcome Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, Hamlet's childhood friends. The King expresses concern over Hamlet's ""transformation"" and asks them to stay at court to draw Hamlet out to pleasures and discover the cause of his affliction. The Queen assures them Hamlet holds them in high regard. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern pledge their service. They exit to find Hamlet.
Polonius enters, confident he has found ""The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy."" The King eagerly listens. Polonius, after a verbose introduction about brevity, declares Hamlet is mad. He then reads a love letter from Hamlet to Ophelia, which includes the lines: ""Doubt thou the stars are fire; Doubt thou the sun doth move; Doubt truth to be a liar; But never doubt, I love."" Polonius explains that Ophelia, in obedience, showed him this and reported Hamlet's solicitations. He recounts how he instructed Ophelia to repel Hamlet's advances, which, he believes, caused Hamlet's sadness, weakness, and ultimately, madness. The King and Queen find this plausible. Polonius proposes a test: they will ""loose"" Ophelia to Hamlet in the lobby while they observe, to see if his behavior confirms his love-madness. The King agrees.
The King and Queen exit as Hamlet enters, reading. Polonius accosts Hamlet, who feigns madness, calling Polonius a ""fishmonger"" and making cryptic remarks about honesty, the sun breeding maggots in ""carrion,"" and warning Polonius to keep his daughter ""not walk i'the sun"" to avoid ""conception."" Polonius, aside, notes, ""Though this be madness, yet there's method in it."" Hamlet continues to mock Polonius, calling him an old man with ""a plentiful lack of wit."" Polonius exits, planning the meeting between Hamlet and Ophelia.
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern enter. Hamlet greets them warmly but quickly discerns they were ""sent for"" by the King and Queen. He expresses his recent loss of mirth, describing the earth as a ""steril promontory"" and man, despite his noble reason and god-like apprehension, as a ""quintessence of dust"" that delights him not. Rosencrantz explains they met players on the way, who are coming to offer service. Hamlet welcomes the players and asks about their travels, noting that his uncle being king has changed public taste. A flourish of trumpets announces the players' arrival. Polonius enters, announcing the players. Hamlet mocks him, then greets the players, asking one to recite a passionate speech about Priam's slaughter from Aeneas's tale to Dido. The Player performs a dramatic speech, moving Polonius to tears. Hamlet commends the player and instructs Polonius to treat them well, as they are ""the abstract and brief chronicles of the time."" Hamlet asks if they can play ""The Murder of Gonzago"" and if the First Player can study a short speech he will insert. The Player agrees.
Alone, Hamlet chastises himself for his inaction, comparing his lack of passion to the player's emotional performance over Hecuba, ""What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba, That he should weep for her?"" He calls himself a ""dull and muddy-mettled rascal"" and a ""coward"" for not avenging his father. He resolves to use the play to confirm the Ghost's story, believing that ""guilty creatures, sitting at a play, Have by the very cunning of the scene Been struck so to the soul, that presently They have proclaim'd their malefactions."" He will observe his uncle's reaction: ""if he do blench, I know my course."" He acknowledges the Ghost might be a devil abusing his melancholy, so he needs ""good grounds More relative than this."" He concludes: ""The play's the thing Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king.""

**ACT III**

**SCENE I – A Room in the Castle.**
The King and Queen question Rosencrantz and Guildenstern about Hamlet's behavior. They report Hamlet feels distracted but won't reveal the cause. They mention his interest in the players they ""o'er-raught on the way"" and his request for the King and Queen to see the play that night. The King is pleased by this ""kind of joy"" and encourages them to further engage Hamlet. The King then asks Gertrude to leave so he and Polonius can ""closely sent for Hamlet"" to ""Affront Ophelia"" while they, as ""lawful espials,"" observe their encounter to determine if Hamlet's madness is indeed due to love. The Queen expresses hope that Ophelia's beauty will restore Hamlet. Ophelia remains, and Polonius instructs her to read a book to ""colour Your loneliness"" while he and the King hide. Polonius, aside, comments on how people ""with devotion's visage And pious action, we do sugar o'er The devil himself,"" which strikes the King's conscience. They hide.
Hamlet enters and delivers his famous ""To be, or not to be"" soliloquy, contemplating suicide as an escape from life's ""slings and arrows"" and ""thousand natural shocks."" He questions the unknown terrors of death, ""the undiscovered country, from whose bourn No traveller returns,"" which makes people ""rather bear those ills we have Than fly to others that we know not of."" He concludes that ""conscience does make cowards of us all,"" causing great enterprises to falter.
Ophelia then approaches him. Hamlet greets her, and she tries to return ""remembrances"" he gave her. Hamlet denies ever giving them and questions her honesty and fairness, suggesting beauty corrupts honesty. He declares he never loved her and harshly tells her to ""Get thee to a nunnery,"" accusing her of being a ""breeder of sinners"" and listing his own supposed faults. He warns her that even if she is ""chaste as ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not escape calumny."" He further insults women, accusing them of painting their faces, jigging, ambling, lisping, and making ""wantonness your ignorance."" He declares there will be ""no more marriages: those that are married already, all but one, shall live; the rest shall keep as they are."" He exits, still urging her to a nunnery.
Ophelia is devastated, lamenting the ""noble mind... o'erthrown,"" the ""expectancy and rose of the fair state"" now ""Like sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh.""
The King and Polonius re-enter. The King concludes Hamlet's affections ""do not that way tend"" and his speech ""was not like madness."" He suspects ""something in his soul"" and decides to send Hamlet to England immediately, hoping travel will cure his melancholy. Polonius still believes love is the cause but agrees to the England plan. He suggests that after the play, the Queen should speak with Hamlet, while Polonius hides to overhear. If she ""find him not"" (doesn't get to the bottom of his grief), then Hamlet should be sent to England or confined. The King agrees, stating, ""Madness in great ones must not unwatch'd go.""

**SCENE II – A Room in the Same.**
Hamlet instructs a Player on the art of acting, emphasizing naturalness, temperance, and holding ""the mirror up to nature,"" criticizing over-the-top performances and clowns who improvise. He sends the Player to get ready.
Horatio enters, and Hamlet praises him as a just and constant man, unaffected by fortune. He confides in Horatio about the play to be performed, which will depict circumstances similar to his father's death. He asks Horatio to observe the King closely during the scene, promising to join their judgments afterward to determine if the Ghost was honest or a devil.
The King, Queen, Polonius, Ophelia, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, and attendants enter. The King asks Hamlet how he fares, to which Hamlet replies with cryptic remarks. Hamlet asks Polonius about his acting days, and Polonius recalls playing Julius Caesar and being killed in the Capitol. Hamlet makes a pun about it. The Queen invites Hamlet to sit by her, but he chooses to lie at Ophelia's feet, making suggestive and bitter comments about his mother's hasty marriage. He notes his father died ""within these two hours"" (feigning madness, as Ophelia corrects him to ""twice two months"").
The Players begin. A Prologue delivers a brief, rhyming introduction. Then, a Player King and Queen enter. The Player King speaks of their thirty years of marriage, and the Player Queen vows eternal fidelity, swearing never to remarry if he dies. Hamlet, to Horatio, calls this ""wormwood"" and comments to Ophelia, ""As woman's love"" when she notes the prologue is brief. The King asks if there's ""no offence in't,"" and Hamlet assures him it's ""poison in jest."" Hamlet reveals the play's title, ""The Mouse-trap,"" and explains it depicts a murder in Vienna: ""Gonzago is the Duke's name; his wife, Baptista."" He adds, ""Let the galled jade wince, our withers are unwrung.""
Lucianus, the Player King's nephew, enters on stage. Hamlet identifies him as the murderer. Lucianus pours poison into the sleeping Player King's ears. Hamlet loudly explains the plot: ""He poisons him i' the garden for his estate... You shall see anon how the murderer gets the love of Gonzago's wife."" At this, the King rises abruptly, calls for ""lights, lights, lights!"" and rushes out, followed by the court.
Hamlet, now alone with Horatio, exults that the Ghost's word is true. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern return, reporting the King is ""marvellous distempered"" with ""choler"" and the Queen is in ""great affliction of spirit,"" desiring to speak with Hamlet in her closet. Hamlet, still feigning madness, mocks their attempts to ""recover the wind of me"" and ""drive me into a toil."" He asks Guildenstern to play a recorder, but Guildenstern claims he cannot. Hamlet uses this to accuse them of trying to ""play upon me"" and ""pluck out the heart of my mystery,"" saying, ""Call me what instrument you will, though you can fret me, you cannot play upon me.""
Polonius enters, calling Hamlet to the Queen. Hamlet, still playing with his madness, makes Polonius agree that a cloud looks first like a camel, then a weasel, then a whale. Polonius exits. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern also exit.
Alone again, Hamlet reflects on the ""witching time of night"" and his readiness to do ""bitter business."" He resolves to be cruel to his mother but not to harm her physically, saying, ""I will speak daggers to her, but use none."" He exits to his mother's chamber.

**SCENE III – A Room in the Same.**
The King, with Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, confirms his decision to send Hamlet to England with them, stating it's unsafe to let his madness ""range."" He has dispatched their ""commission"" for Hamlet's ""speedy voyage,"" intending to ""put fetters upon this fear."" Rosencrantz and Guildenstern agree to hasten.
Polonius enters, announcing Hamlet is going to his mother's closet. He plans to ""convey myself Behind the arras"" to ""hear the process,"" believing the Queen will ""tax him home."" He reiterates that ""some more audience than a mother"" should overhear, as nature makes mothers partial. Polonius exits to hide. The King exits, thanking Polonius.

**SCENE IV – The Queen’s Chamber.**
The Queen and Polonius are in her chamber. Polonius instructs the Queen to be ""round with him"" and tell Hamlet his ""pranks have been too broad."" He then hides behind the arras. Hamlet enters and immediately confronts his mother. Their exchange is sharp, with Hamlet accusing her of offending his father, and the Queen accusing Hamlet of offending his. When the Queen threatens to send others to speak with him, Hamlet forces her to sit, declaring he will ""set you up a glass Where you may see the inmost part of you."" The Queen, fearing for her life, cries for help. Polonius, from behind the arras, also cries ""Help!"" Hamlet, hearing a noise, cries ""How now! a rat?"" and draws his rapier, stabbing through the arras. Polonius falls and dies.
Hamlet, returning, asks, ""Is it the king?"" The Queen is horrified by the ""rash and bloody deed."" Hamlet retorts that it's ""almost as bad... As kill a king, and marry with his brother."" The Queen is shocked by the accusation of killing a king. Hamlet pulls Polonius's body from behind the arras, calling him a ""wretched, rash, intruding fool,"" and lamenting he ""took thee for thy better.""
Hamlet then continues to chastise his mother, accusing her of an act that ""blurs the grace and blush of modesty,"" makes ""marriage vows As false as dicer's oaths,"" and has coupled with a ""mildew'd ear, Blasting his wholesome brother."" He shows her two pictures, one of his father (Hyperion-like) and one of Claudius (a ""moor""), questioning how she could leave the former to ""batten on this moor."" He calls Claudius a ""murderer and a villain,"" a ""cutpurse of the empire and the rule,"" and a ""king Of shreds and patches.""
The Ghost re-enters, visible only to Hamlet. Hamlet asks if it comes to chide his ""tardy son"" for neglecting his command. The Ghost confirms its purpose is ""to whet thy almost blunted purpose"" and urges Hamlet to step between his mother and her ""fighting soul."" The Queen, seeing Hamlet speak to empty air, believes he is mad. Hamlet describes the Ghost's pale glare. The Queen asks to whom he speaks, seeing ""Nothing at all."" Hamlet points out the Ghost as it ""steals away,"" describing it as ""My father in his habit as he lived!"" The Ghost exits.
The Queen, convinced of Hamlet's madness, calls it a ""bodiless creation ecstasy."" Hamlet, however, asserts his sanity, offering to re-word his accusations. He urges her to confess to heaven, repent, and ""go not to my uncle's bed."" He advises her to ""Assume a virtue, if you have it not."" He expresses repentance for Polonius's death, promising to ""answer well The death I gave him."" He bids his mother good night and exits with Polonius's body, stating, ""I must be cruel, only to be kind: Thus bad begins, and worse remains behind.""

**ACT IV**

**SCENE I – A Room in the Castle.**
The King and Queen enter. The Queen, sighing deeply, tells the King that Hamlet, ""Mad as the sea and wind,"" killed Polonius, mistaking him for a rat behind the arras. The King expresses regret, realizing it could have been him, and decides Hamlet must be shipped to England immediately. He calls Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, instructing them to find Hamlet, speak fairly, and bring Polonius's body to the chapel. He then tells Gertrude they will call their ""wisest friends"" to ""countenance and excuse"" the deed, acknowledging that Hamlet is ""lov'd of the distracted multitude,"" making it difficult to apply the law against him.
Rosencrantz returns, unable to get Hamlet to reveal where the body is. The King orders Hamlet brought before him. Hamlet, Guildenstern, and attendants enter. The King asks where Polonius is. Hamlet cryptically replies, ""At supper,"" explaining Polonius is being eaten by ""politick worms."" He tells the King to send to Heaven to find him, or seek him in ""the other place"" himself, adding that within a month, the King will ""nose him as you go up the stairs into the lobby."" The King sends Guildenstern to find the body.
The King informs Hamlet that, for his ""especial safety,"" he must go to England immediately. Hamlet agrees. The King, in an aside, reveals his true purpose: he has sent ""letters conjuring to that effect"" to England, demanding ""The present death of Hamlet."" He states his joys will not begin until he knows it is done. The King exits.

**SCENE (Un-numbered) – A Room in the Castle (later in Act IV).**
The Queen and Horatio discuss Ophelia, whom the Queen refuses to see. Horatio insists Ophelia is ""distract"" and ""importunate,"" and it would be good to speak with her to prevent her from spreading ""dangerous conjectures."" The Queen relents. Horatio re-enters with Ophelia, who is dressed fantastically with straws and flowers and sings madly about a true love who is dead and gone, buried with ""grass-green turf"" and ""sweet flowers."" The King enters and observes her. Ophelia continues to sing, mentioning St. Valentine's Day and a maid who ""Never departed more"" after being let in. She laments her father's death, saying, ""I cannot choose but weep, to think they should lay him i'the cold ground."" She speaks of her brother knowing of it and bids good night. She exits, followed by the Queen.
The King tells Horatio to follow Ophelia. He laments that ""One woe doth tread upon another's heel,"" all stemming from Polonius's death. Marcellus enters, reporting that young Laertes has returned ""in a riotous head,"" leading a rebellion, with the rabble crying, ""Laertes shall be king!"" Laertes enters, armed and followed by Danes, demanding his father from the King. The Queen tries to interpose. Laertes, enraged, declares any calm blood in him would brand his mother a harlot. The King, asserting his divine protection, asks Laertes the cause of his rebellion. Laertes demands to know how his father died, swearing he will be revenged ""Most throughly."" The King assures Laertes he is ""guiltless of your father's death"" and promises to make the truth clear.
Ophelia re-enters, still mad, dressed with straws and flowers. Laertes is heartbroken, calling her ""O rose of May!"" and lamenting that her wits are ""as mortal as an old man's life."" Ophelia sings about her father's burial and distributes imaginary flowers, explaining their symbolic meanings: rosemary for remembrance, pansies for thoughts, fennel for flattery, columbines, rue (herb of grace) for sorrow, and a daisy. She mentions violets withered when her father died. She sings another mournful song about her dead love. Laertes is deeply moved, noting she turns ""Thought and affliction, passion, hell itself, To favour and to prettiness."" Ophelia exits.
Laertes, grieving, is called to commune with the King. Bernardo enters with letters from Hamlet, one for the King and one for the Queen. The King reads Hamlet's letter, which states he is ""set naked on your kingdom"" and will beg leave to see the King's eyes tomorrow to recount his ""sudden and more strange return."" The King is perplexed, wondering if it's a trick. Laertes recognizes Hamlet's hand and is filled with a ""sickness in my heart"" at the thought of confronting Hamlet.
The King, seeing Laertes' desire for revenge, proposes a plan. He recalls a gentleman from Normandy who praised Laertes' skill in fencing, especially with a rapier. The King suggests they will praise Laertes' excellence to Hamlet, who is ""remiss, Most generous, and free from all contriving,"" and will not ""peruse the foils."" This will allow Laertes to choose ""A sword unbated"" (unblunted) and, in a ""pass of practice,"" ""Requite him for your father."" Laertes eagerly agrees, adding he will anoint his sword with a ""mortal"" poison from a ""mountebank,"" so that even a slight scratch will be fatal. The King adds a backup plan: he will prepare a ""chalice for the nonce"" with poison, so if Hamlet escapes the sword, he will die by drinking.
The Queen enters, announcing, ""Your sister's drown'd, Laertes."" She describes Ophelia's death: she made ""fantastick garlands"" of flowers, climbed a willow tree over a brook to hang them, an ""envious sliver broke,"" and she fell into the ""weeping brook"" with her ""weedy trophies,"" her clothes spreading her ""mermaid-like"" for a while before pulling her down to ""muddy death."" Laertes, fighting back tears, exits, expressing his rage that ""this folly drowns it.""

**ACT V**

**SCENE I – A Church Yard.**
Two Clowns (gravediggers) are digging a grave. They debate whether Ophelia, having ""wilfully seeks her own salvation"" (suicide), deserves a Christian burial. The First Clown argues it must be ""se offendendo"" (a corruption of _se defendendo_), and that an act has three branches: ""to act, to do, and to perform."" The Second Clown says if she wasn't a gentlewoman, she wouldn't get Christian burial. The First Clown jokes about the ancient profession of grave-makers, holding up Adam's profession, and poses a riddle about who builds stronger than a mason, shipwright, or carpenter. After the Second Clown guesses wrong, the First Clown reveals it's a grave-maker, whose houses last till doomsday. The Second Clown exits to fetch liquor.
Hamlet and Horatio enter, observing the First Clown singing while digging and throwing up skulls. Hamlet reflects on the insensitivity of the gravedigger. He picks up a skull, asking whose it was. The gravedigger reveals it belonged to Yorick, the King's jester, whom Hamlet knew well. Hamlet holds Yorick's skull, reminiscing about his ""infinite jest"" and ""flashes of merriment,"" and contemplating mortality, how even Alexander the Great and Imperial Caesar could return to dust and be used to ""stop a bung-hole"" or ""patch a wall.""
A funeral procession enters, including Priests, Ophelia's corpse, Laertes, the King, Queen, and their trains. Hamlet and Horatio hide. Laertes asks the Priest what further ceremony there will be. The Priest replies that her ""obsequies have been as far enlarg'd As we have warranty,"" as her death was ""doubtful,"" and without ""great command"" she would have been buried in unsanctified ground with ""Shards, flints, and pebbles"" thrown on her. Laertes, angered by the priest's ""churlish"" words, declares that Ophelia will be a ""ministering angel"" when the priest lies howling.
The Queen scatters flowers on Ophelia's grave, saying, ""Sweets to the sweet: Farewell!"" She expresses her hope that Ophelia would have been Hamlet's wife, not buried. Laertes, in a fit of grief, leaps into the grave, wishing ""treble woe"" on the head whose ""wicked deed"" deprived Ophelia of her ""ingenious sense."" He demands to be buried with her.
Hamlet, revealing himself, advances, asking, ""What is he whose grief Bears such an emphasis?"" He declares, ""this is I, Hamlet the Dane."" Laertes leaps from the grave and grapples with Hamlet, cursing him. Hamlet tells him to take his fingers from his throat, warning of his dangerous nature. The King and Queen order them separated. Hamlet declares he will fight Laertes ""upon this theme Until my eyelids will no longer wag."" The Queen cries out that Hamlet is mad. Hamlet proclaims, ""I lov'd Ophelia: forty thousand brothers Could not, with all their quantity of love, Make up my sum."" He challenges Laertes to weep, fight, fast, or tear himself, saying he will do it too, and mocks Laertes for leaping into the grave. He rants about piling mountains on them. The Queen calls it ""mere madness."" Hamlet exits, saying, ""The cat will mew, and dog will have his day."" The King tells Horatio to follow Hamlet and reassures Laertes, reminding him of their ""last night's speech"" (their plot) and promising a ""living monument"" for the grave.

**SCENE II – Hall in the Castle.**
Hamlet apologizes to Horatio for his behavior towards Laertes, recognizing the ""portraiture of his"" cause in his own. Osric enters, welcoming Hamlet back to Denmark. Hamlet mocks Osric's affected language and mannerisms. Osric, on behalf of the King, invites Hamlet to a fencing match with Laertes, for a wager the King has laid: six Barbary horses against six French rapiers and poignards. Osric describes Laertes as an ""absolute gentleman, full of most excellent differences, of very soft society and great showing."" The wager is that in a dozen passes, Laertes will not exceed Hamlet by three hits. Hamlet agrees to the trial, despite a ""gain-giving"" (misgiving) in his heart, but defies augury, believing ""there is a special providence in the fall of a sparrow.""
The King, Queen, Laertes, Lords, Ladies, Osric, and attendants enter for the match. Hamlet offers his hand to Laertes and apologizes for his past wrong, attributing it to his madness, saying he ""shot my arrow o'er the house, And hurt my brother."" Laertes accepts the apology ""in nature,"" but reserves his honor until a ""elder master"" can resolve it. They prepare to fence. The King orders wine brought and announces that if Hamlet hits first or second, or quits in answer to the third, cannons will fire, and he will drink to Hamlet's health, dropping a precious ""union"" (pearl) into the cup.
The match begins. Hamlet scores the first hit. Osric confirms it. The King offers Hamlet the poisoned cup, saying, ""Hamlet, this pearl is thine; Here's to thy health."" Hamlet defers drinking, saying he'll play another bout. Hamlet scores a second hit. The Queen, against the King's warning, drinks from the poisoned cup to Hamlet's fortune. The King, aside, realizes, ""It is the poison'd cup; it is too late."" Laertes, aside, expresses a pang of conscience but resolves to hit Hamlet.
They play the third bout. Laertes wounds Hamlet with the poisoned rapier. In the ensuing scuffle, they exchange rapiers, and Hamlet wounds Laertes with the poisoned blade. The Queen falls back in her chair. Osric and Horatio attend to the wounded. Laertes, dying, reveals the treachery: he is ""justly killed with mine own treachery,"" caught ""as a woodcock to my own springe."" He confesses the rapier is ""Unbated and envenom'd,"" and the Queen is poisoned. He declares, ""the king, the king's to blame.""
Hamlet, realizing the full extent of the plot, stabs the King with the poisoned rapier, crying, ""Here, thou incestuous, murd'rous, damnèd Dane, Follow my mother."" The King is borne away, mortally wounded. Laertes, dying, exchanges forgiveness with Hamlet, absolving him of his and his father's death, and asking his own death not to be on Hamlet. Laertes dies.
Hamlet, dying from the poison, asks Horatio to ""Report me and my cause aright To the unsatisfied."" Horatio, wanting to die with him, seizes the poisoned cup, but Hamlet dashes it away, begging Horatio to live and ""in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain, To tell my story."" Hamlet's last words are, ""The potent poison quite o'er-crows my spirit; The rest is silence."" Hamlet dies. A dead march sounds afar off as the curtain slowly descends."
Jane Eyre-Charlotte Brontë,"The plot of the provided text, ""Jane Eyre,"" follows the life of the protagonist, Jane, from her childhood at Gateshead Hall through her experiences at Lowood School, her time as a governess at Thornfield Hall, and her eventual reunion and marriage.

**Childhood at Gateshead Hall:**
The story begins on a cold, rainy winter day at Gateshead Hall, where young Jane is excluded from the family circle by her aunt, Mrs. Reed, who deems her unsociable. Jane retreats to the breakfast-room, finding solace in a book of pictures. Her cousin, John Reed, discovers her, verbally abuses her, and then strikes her by throwing a book, causing her head to bleed. In a rare outburst, Jane retaliates, calling John a ""wicked and cruel boy."" Mrs. Reed, summoned by her daughters Eliza and Georgiana, orders Jane to be locked in the red-room, a seldom-used chamber where her deceased uncle, Mr. Reed, had died.

Confined in the red-room, Jane reflects on the injustices she suffers from the Reeds. She recalls that her uncle had made Mrs. Reed promise to raise her as one of her own children. As darkness falls, Jane becomes terrified by a gleam of light, believing it to be a ghost, and screams. Mrs. Reed, convinced Jane is a manipulative child, punishes her further by leaving her locked in. Jane then loses consciousness.

**Lowood School:**
Jane wakes in her nursery bed, attended by Bessie, the nurse, and Mr. Lloyd, an apothecary. Mr. Lloyd questions Jane about her unhappiness, and she reveals her lack of parents and the cruel treatment she endures. Mr. Lloyd suggests she needs a change of environment, leading to Mrs. Reed's decision to send Jane to Lowood School. From Bessie and Miss Abbot's gossip, Jane learns her parents died of typhus, and her mother was disinherited by her family for marrying a poor clergyman.

Jane departs for Lowood, a charity-school for orphans. Upon arrival, she meets the kind superintendent, Miss Temple, and the strict under-teacher, Miss Miller. The school conditions are harsh: cold, insufficient clothing, and meager, often unpalatable food (burnt porridge). Jane befriends Helen Burns, a fellow pupil, who endures constant criticism and physical punishment from Miss Scatcherd with stoic patience and a philosophy of Christian forgiveness. Jane, in contrast, believes in fighting back against injustice.

A typhus epidemic sweeps through Lowood, caused by the unsanitary conditions and poor nourishment. Many girls fall ill and die. Helen Burns, suffering from consumption, is moved to Miss Temple's room. Jane, realizing Helen is dying, secretly visits her. Helen expresses her faith in God and a peaceful acceptance of death, comforting Jane. Helen dies in Jane's arms. The public inquiry into the epidemic leads to reforms at Lowood, improving conditions and management.

**Thornfield Hall:**
Eight years pass. Jane remains at Lowood, first as a pupil, then as a teacher. Miss Temple marries and leaves, prompting Jane to seek a new position. She advertises for a governess and receives a reply from Mrs. Fairfax of Thornfield Hall. Before leaving, Bessie visits Jane, bringing news of the Reed family: John Reed has died by suicide, and Mrs. Reed has suffered a stroke and is dying, calling for Jane. Bessie also mentions that Jane's uncle, Mr. Eyre, had once sought her out but was turned away by Mrs. Reed.

Jane travels to Thornfield, a large, old manor house. She is warmly received by Mrs. Fairfax, the housekeeper, who she initially mistakes for the owner. Jane's pupil is Adèle Varens, a lively French child. Jane notices a mysterious, mirthless laugh emanating from the third storey, which Mrs. Fairfax attributes to a servant named Grace Poole. Jane later overhears that Grace Poole receives unusually high wages, hinting at a secret.

One evening, while out walking, Jane encounters a horseman who has fallen on ice. She helps him, and he is revealed to be Mr. Rochester, the master of Thornfield. He is a dark, stern, yet intriguing man. He later invites Jane and Adèle to tea, where he engages Jane in direct and challenging conversation. He is impressed by her artistic talents and her frankness. He reveals Adèle is the illegitimate daughter of a French opera-dancer, Céline Varens, with whom he had a past affair. He keeps Adèle out of a sense of duty, not believing she is his child. Jane's affection for Mr. Rochester deepens, despite his peculiarities and her awareness of his intended marriage to the beautiful and accomplished Blanche Ingram.

During a party at Thornfield, a disguised Mr. Rochester, posing as a gipsy fortune-teller, attempts to gauge Jane's feelings and make her jealous. Blanche Ingram returns from her session looking disappointed, suggesting the gipsy revealed something unfavorable about Mr. Rochester's fortune. Jane is then summoned by the gipsy, who reveals intimate knowledge of Jane's thoughts and feelings, confirming Jane's love for Mr. Rochester and hinting at his love for her. Jane realizes the gipsy is Mr. Rochester in disguise.

Later that night, a terrifying scream from the third storey awakens the house. Mr. Rochester calms the guests, claiming it was a servant's nightmare, but secretly enlists Jane's help. He leads her to a hidden room on the third floor, where Mr. Mason, a visitor from the West Indies, lies wounded and bleeding from a knife and bite wound. Mr. Rochester instructs Jane to tend to Mason while he fetches a surgeon, forbidding her to speak to Mason. Jane is left alone with Mason, terrified that Grace Poole, whom she suspects of the attack, is nearby. The surgeon arrives and confirms Mason's wounds were caused by teeth. Mason reveals Bertha Mason attacked him. Mr. Rochester silences Mason and ensures his swift, secret departure.

Mr. Rochester later explains that Bertha Mason is his mad wife, whom his family tricked him into marrying for her fortune in Jamaica. She comes from a family with a history of madness and is violent and unchaste. He keeps her confined at Thornfield with Grace Poole as her keeper. He confesses his love for Jane and asks her to marry him, claiming his marriage to Bertha is not a true union. Jane, though deeply in love, refuses to become his mistress while his wife is alive, adhering to her moral principles.

**Flight and Moor House:**
Overwhelmed by her love for Mr. Rochester and her moral convictions, Jane resolves to leave Thornfield. As she is about to depart, Mr. Rochester pleads with her, confessing his agony and despair, but Jane remains firm. In a moment of intense spiritual turmoil, she hears a voice call her name, which she recognizes as Mr. Rochester's, and interprets it as a divine sign. She flees Thornfield before dawn, with only a small amount of money, leaving everything else behind.

After two days of wandering and destitution, nearly starving, Jane collapses at the door of a remote cottage called Moor House. She is taken in by the kind Rivers siblings: Diana, Mary, and St. John. She gives them the alias ""Jane Elliott"" to avoid discovery. She gradually recovers and learns that the Rivers are her cousins; their uncle, John Eyre of Madeira (Jane's uncle), has died and left his entire fortune of twenty thousand pounds to his brother's orphan daughter—Jane Eyre.

Jane, now wealthy, insists on dividing her inheritance equally among herself and her three cousins, giving each five thousand pounds. She accepts a position as mistress of a village school in Morton, a humble but independent role.

**St. John Rivers' Proposal:**
St. John, a zealous clergyman, reveals his ambition to be a missionary in India and asks Jane to accompany him as his wife. He argues that she is suited for labor, not love, and that their marriage would serve God's purpose. Jane admires his dedication but refuses to marry him, as she does not love him and believes he would treat her as a useful tool rather than a beloved wife. She offers to go as his sister and fellow-missionary, but he rejects this, insisting on marriage for the sake of propriety and efficiency in his mission. He warns her that refusing him is refusing God.

**Reunion with Mr. Rochester:**
During this period of intense pressure from St. John, Jane again hears Mr. Rochester's voice calling her name, which she interprets as a sign that he is alive and needs her. She decides to return to Thornfield. Upon her return, she discovers Thornfield Hall is a blackened ruin, having been destroyed by fire. The innkeeper informs her that Bertha Mason set the fire and, after Mr. Rochester rescued the servants, she jumped from the battlements to her death. Mr. Rochester, in his attempt to save her, was severely injured: he lost one eye, his other eye became blind, and one hand was amputated. He now lives as a blind and crippled recluse at Ferndean, a desolate manor house, attended only by old John and his wife.

Jane immediately travels to Ferndean. She finds Mr. Rochester, blind and disfigured, but still recognizable. Their reunion is emotional. He initially mistakes her for a servant, but recognizes her voice and touch. Jane reveals her identity and her inheritance, and vows to stay with him, to be his companion, eyes, and hands. Mr. Rochester, initially despairing, is revived by her presence and love. He confesses he had called out her name on the very night she heard it.

**Conclusion:**
Jane marries Mr. Rochester in a quiet ceremony. She describes ten years of blissful married life, where she is completely devoted to him, serving as his ""vision"" and ""right hand."" After two years, Mr. Rochester regains partial sight in one eye, enough to discern objects and see their first-born son, who has inherited his original brilliant eyes. He acknowledges God's mercy.

Diana and Mary Rivers both marry and visit Jane and Mr. Rochester annually. St. John Rivers goes to India as a missionary, remaining unmarried and dedicating his life to his work. Jane receives a final letter from him, hinting at his approaching death, which she accepts with a mix of human tears and ""divine joy,"" knowing he will receive his reward in heaven. Jane also brings Adèle from her strict school, finds her a more suitable one, and Adèle grows into a pleasing companion. Jane concludes her narrative by expressing her supreme happiness in her marriage, living entirely for and with the man she loves."
Madame Bovary-Gustave Flaubert,"The story begins with the introduction of Charles Bovary, a new and awkward fifteen-year-old student, to a class. He is ridiculed for his unusual cap and stammering. Despite his initial struggles, he proves to be a conscientious student. The narrative then delves into Charles's family background: his father, Monsieur Charles Denis Bartolome Bovary, a retired assistant-surgeon-major, had squandered his wife's dowry and retired to the country. Charles's mother, initially loving, became embittered by her husband's infidelity and idleness, managing the household while he remained indifferent. Charles's childhood was marked by his mother's spoiling and his father's attempts to raise him hardily. He received irregular schooling from the local curé before being sent to Rouen at eighteen. There, he was a mediocre student, later studying medicine. After an initial failure in his examination (covered up by his mother), he eventually passed and began practicing in Tostes. His mother then arranged his marriage to Heloise Dubuc, a forty-five-year-old widow with an income. Heloise proved to be a controlling and hypochondriac wife, constantly complaining and monitoring Charles.

One night, Charles is called to the Bertaux farm to set the broken leg of Monsieur Rouault. His wife, Heloise, expresses concern for his safety. At the farm, Charles is greeted by Monsieur Rouault's young daughter, Emma. Charles is struck by Emma's appearance, particularly her delicate nails and candid eyes. He successfully treats Monsieur Rouault, earning a reputation for skill. Charles begins to visit the Bertaux frequently, finding pleasure in Emma's company. Heloise grows suspicious, learning of Emma's education and accusing Charles of seeking ""town misses."" She makes him swear on a prayer-book to stop visiting. Soon after, it is revealed that Heloise's fortune was largely mortgaged, and a notary absconds with her remaining funds. Charles's father is enraged, blaming his wife for the marriage. Heloise, distraught, falls ill and dies shortly after. Charles is saddened, realizing her love for him.

Monsieur Rouault visits Charles to pay for his services and offers condolences, inviting Charles back to the Bertaux. Charles accepts, finding comfort in the farm's lively atmosphere and Emma's presence. He begins to enjoy his newfound independence from Heloise. He and Emma share a drink, and she speaks of her convent life and her longing for a different existence. Charles becomes infatuated with Emma, constantly thinking of her and resolving to propose. Monsieur Rouault, burdened by debts and finding Emma of little use on the farm, is amenable to the match. Charles proposes, and Emma accepts. The marriage is set for the following spring, after Charles's mourning period. Emma busies herself with her trousseau, dreaming of a romantic wedding, though her father insists on a traditional one. The wedding is a large, boisterous affair with forty-three guests, lasting sixteen hours. Charles's father flirts, and his mother is displeased by the arrangements. Charles, though not facetious, is openly affectionate with Emma the next day. They leave for Tostes, and old Rouault reflects on his own past.

At their home in Tostes, Emma is immediately dissatisfied with the modest surroundings, particularly discovering Charles's first wife's bridal bouquet. She begins to redecorate extensively and Charles buys her a dogcart. Charles is deeply happy, finding joy in small details of their life together and contrasting it with his past unhappiness. He showers Emma with affection. Emma, however, feels a profound disillusionment. She had expected a grand passion, but finds only commonplace affection. The narrative then details Emma's past: her romantic education at the convent through novels and keepsakes, her dreams of luxury and heroic love, and her subsequent boredom with the realities of country life. She secretly yearns for excitement and passion. Charles's mundane conversation and habits irritate her, and she resents his contentment. She attempts to cultivate love for him, but her efforts are in vain. She feels trapped by the ""mediocrity of existence"" and longs for an escape.

An invitation to a ball at the Marquis d’Andervilliers’ château offers a glimpse into the aristocratic world Emma craves. She meticulously prepares and is captivated by the luxurious environment, the elegant guests, and the exotic food. She is particularly fascinated by the old Duke de Laverdiere, a former courtier. At the ball, she dances a waltz with a Viscount, experiencing a moment of intense physical and emotional connection. The experience reinforces her disdain for her own life. Upon returning to Tostes, Emma is profoundly changed. The memory of the ball becomes an obsession, making her present life seem even more unbearable. She fires her servant, Nastasie, in a fit of temper. She finds a cigar case left by one of the gentlemen at the ball, which becomes a cherished memento, fueling her fantasies of Paris and a more exciting life. She devours romantic novels and ladies' journals, creating an idealized vision of the world beyond Yonville. She replaces Nastasie with Félicité, a young orphan, whom she attempts to mold into a lady's maid. Charles remains oblivious to Emma's inner turmoil, finding comfort in her presence and his growing reputation as a doctor. Emma, however, grows increasingly irritable and contemptuous of Charles's commonness and lack of ambition. She suffers from palpitations and fits of melancholy. Charles, believing her illness is due to Tostes, decides to move to Yonville-l’Abbaye, where a doctor's position is vacant. Before leaving Tostes, Emma burns her own wedding bouquet, symbolizing the end of her illusions. She is pregnant when they move.

In Yonville, Emma gives birth to a daughter, Berthe, but is disappointed it is not a son. She is indifferent to the child at first, but later develops a possessive affection. Charles's father dies, and Homais, the chemist, delivers the news clumsily. Emma's financial situation becomes precarious as she incurs significant debts to Monsieur Lheureux, a draper and moneylender, buying luxurious items and signing bills. She obtains a power of attorney from Charles, ostensibly to manage his father's estate, but uses it to further her own financial schemes. Emma begins an affair with Léon Dupuis, a notary's clerk, who shares her romantic sensibilities and intellectual aspirations. Their rendezvous take place in Rouen, where Emma pretends to take music lessons. Their love is passionate, but Léon eventually grows weary of her intensity and the risks involved. He is also influenced by his employer and mother to end the affair. Emma, meanwhile, continues to plunge deeper into debt and extravagance, driven by her insatiable desires. She becomes increasingly reckless, even spending a night away from Yonville, causing Charles great anxiety. Charles remains largely unaware of her infidelities and financial mismanagement, attributing her moods to her ""nervous illness.""

Emma's debts spiral out of control. Lheureux, now her primary creditor, demands payment, threatening distraint on her property. Desperate, Emma first seeks help from Léon, who, fearing for his own reputation and financial stability, refuses to lend her the large sum she needs. She then turns to Rodolphe Boulanger, her former lover, who also rejects her pleas for money, revealing his callous nature. Overwhelmed by shame, despair, and the imminent loss of her possessions, Emma steals arsenic from Homais's ""Capharnaum"" (his private laboratory) and poisons herself.

Charles is distraught during Emma's agonizing death. Doctor Lariviere, a renowned surgeon, confirms there is nothing to be done. Homais, the chemist, attempts to manage the situation, offering false explanations for Emma's death and using the event to further his own reputation. After Emma's death, Charles discovers her love letters to Léon and Rodolphe, revealing her infidelities. Despite the betrayal, he remains devoted to her memory, adopting her tastes and preferences. He struggles immensely with the debts Emma left behind, selling off his possessions piece by piece. He eventually encounters Rodolphe, but instead of anger, expresses a resigned sorrow, blaming ""fatality"" for their misfortunes. Charles's health deteriorates, and he is found dead in the arbour, holding a lock of Emma's hair. A post-mortem finds no specific cause of death.

After Charles's death, all their remaining possessions are sold. Their daughter, Berthe, is sent to live with her grandmother, who also dies shortly after. Berthe is then taken in by an aunt and eventually sent to work in a cotton-factory. Monsieur Homais, the chemist, prospers greatly. He successfully drives out other doctors from Yonville, expands his practice, and is eventually awarded the cross of the Legion of Honour, achieving the social recognition he always craved."
Mrs. Dalloway-Virginia Woolf,"The story begins on a beautiful June morning in London. **Clarissa Dalloway**, a society hostess, decides to buy flowers herself for a party she is hosting that evening. She reflects on her youth at Bourton, recalling her passionate friendship with **Sally Seton** and her complex relationship with **Peter Walsh**, an old suitor whom she ultimately rejected to marry **Richard Dalloway**. She remembers Peter's criticisms and his eventual marriage to a woman in India. Clarissa encounters **Hugh Whitbread**, an old friend, who is taking his wife, Evelyn, to doctors. Clarissa feels a sense of being defined as ""Mrs. Richard Dalloway"" and observes the bustling life of London, which she deeply loves.

While Clarissa is at a florist on Bond Street, a motor car causes a commotion in the street, stopping traffic. Passers-by speculate about the identity of the important person inside, whose face is only briefly glimpsed. **Septimus Warren Smith**, a pale and apprehensive war veteran, is among the onlookers. He is deeply disturbed, believing the world is signaling to him and that he is blocking the way. His young Italian wife, **Lucrezia (Rezia)**, tries to calm him, worried about his mental state and his threats of suicide. She has been advised by **Dr. Holmes** to make Septimus take an interest in external things, but Septimus continues to experience vivid delusions, hearing voices and seeing his dead friend, **Evans**. Rezia, feeling isolated and suffering, wishes Septimus were dead.

Septimus and Rezia sit in Regent's Park. An aeroplane flies overhead, writing letters in the sky with white smoke. Septimus interprets these as profound messages meant for him, full of ""unimaginable beauty."" Rezia, told by a nursemaid it's an advertisement for ""toffee,"" tries to spell it with him. Septimus's delusions intensify, causing him physical pain and overwhelming sensory experiences. He believes he is the ""lord of men"" and has discovered universal truths. Rezia, frustrated by Dr. Holmes's dismissal of Septimus's illness, decides they must go to **Sir William Bradshaw**, a renowned nerve specialist.

Back at her home, Clarissa learns from her maid, Lucy, that Richard is lunching with **Lady Bruton**, and she was not invited, which makes her feel old and diminished. She goes upstairs and reflects on her life choices, particularly her decision not to marry Peter and her ""virginity preserved through childbirth."" She recalls her past intimacy with Sally Seton and the profound impact of Sally's kiss. While mending her party dress, Peter Walsh unexpectedly arrives from India. He is emotional, kisses her hands, and notes her aging. He criticizes her life and her marriage to Richard, whom he sees as a Conservative. Peter reveals he is in love with a married woman in India, Daisy, and is seeking a divorce. Peter breaks down in tears, and Clarissa comforts him, momentarily wondering what her life would have been like if she had married him. Their conversation is interrupted by the arrival of Clarissa's daughter, **Elizabeth**. Peter abruptly leaves, reminding Clarissa of her party.

Peter walks through London, reflecting on Clarissa, his past, and his own feelings of failure. He sees marching soldiers and observes London life, feeling a temporary sense of youth and freedom. He pursues an attractive young woman, but the encounter is fleeting, and he realizes it was a self-created fantasy. He rests in Regent's Park, dozing and experiencing visions. He recalls a past argument with Clarissa about a woman who had a child out of wedlock, which he saw as the ""death of her soul."" He remembers the ""terrible scene"" by the fountain where Clarissa rejected him, ending their relationship.

Meanwhile, Rezia, still in Regent's Park, struggles with Septimus's condition. Septimus, believing his wedding ring falling off signifies the end of their marriage, feels a sense of freedom and a mission to reveal universal truths. He has visions of Evans and believes dogs are turning into men. He sings an ""immortal ode to Time."" Rezia tries to bring him back to reality, reminding him of their appointment with Sir William Bradshaw.

Septimus and Rezia arrive at Sir William Bradshaw's Harley Street practice. Sir William quickly diagnoses Septimus with a severe nervous breakdown, dismissing Dr. Holmes's earlier assessment. He speaks to Rezia alone, confirming Septimus's illness and his threats of suicide. He recommends Septimus be sent to a country home for a long rest, away from her, to regain a ""sense of proportion."" Septimus resists, feeling trapped by Holmes and Bradshaw, whom he sees as ""human nature"" persecuting him. He tries to confess his ""crime"" but cannot articulate it. Sir William, representing ""Proportion"" and ""Conversion,"" insists on his authority and dismisses them. Rezia feels deserted and dislikes Sir William.

Richard Dalloway and Hugh Whitbread are at Lady Bruton's lunch party. Lady Bruton is preoccupied with her emigration project and has Hugh draft a letter to the _Times_. She expresses her preference for Richard over Hugh, but defends Hugh's kindness. She mentions Peter Walsh's return. Richard decides to buy flowers for Clarissa, intending to tell her he loves her, a rare expression for him.

Richard arrives home, holding the flowers, just as Big Ben strikes three. Clarissa is annoyed about social obligations and Elizabeth's time with **Miss Kilman**, her history tutor, whom Clarissa despises for her religious zeal and perceived cruelty. Richard gives Clarissa the flowers, but cannot explicitly say ""I love you."" Clarissa understands his unspoken affection. They briefly discuss Peter's visit and his impending divorce. Richard leaves for a committee meeting, but not before insisting Clarissa rest. Clarissa, left alone, feels a sudden, desperate unhappiness. She realizes her parties are criticized by Peter and Richard, but she sees them as her ""offering"" to life, her only gift.

Elizabeth comes downstairs, and Clarissa expresses her ""violent anguish"" as Miss Kilman is taking her daughter away. Clarissa cries out to Elizabeth to ""Remember the party!"" Clarissa reflects on ""love and religion"" as ""detestable,"" destroying the ""privacy of the soul."" Miss Kilman, meanwhile, struggles with her own bitterness and hatred for Clarissa, feeling humiliated by Clarissa's laughter. She and Elizabeth go to the Army and Navy Stores for tea. Miss Kilman attempts to keep Elizabeth with her, expressing her love, but Elizabeth leaves, feeling ""flat."" Miss Kilman is ""stricken"" by suffering and goes to Westminster Abbey to pray.

Elizabeth, delighted to be free, boards an omnibus. She enjoys the freedom and considers a career as a doctor or farmer, inspired by the serious atmosphere of the Strand. She realizes it's late and she must return home to dress for dinner.

Septimus, alone in his room, watches the light and shadow, feeling ""Fear no more."" Rezia observes him, troubled by his smiling and visions. They share a moment of intimacy as he helps her design a hat for Mrs. Peters, laughing together. He then feels a renewed terror of being alone. He cries out for Evans, but sees only a screen. Rezia returns, excited by a letter, and they share another moment of connection. Septimus remembers Bradshaw's command that they must be separated. He demands to know Bradshaw's power over him. Rezia explains it's because he threatened suicide. Septimus feels trapped. He asks for his writings, which Rezia brings, and he cries ""Burn them!"" Rezia ties them up, vowing not to be separated from him.

Rezia goes to pack, but hears Dr. Holmes on the stairs. She tries to bar his way, but Holmes, a powerfully built man, pushes past her. Septimus, seeing Holmes coming, considers various ways to die. He chooses the window, seeing it as ""their idea of tragedy."" He cries ""I'll give it you!"" and flings himself out onto Mrs. Filmer's area railings. Dr. Holmes bursts in, calling him a ""coward."" Rezia sees and understands. Dr. Holmes tells her Septimus is horribly mangled and will not recover. Rezia, in a daze, thinks of Septimus having been through the War and says, ""He is dead.""

Later that evening, Clarissa's party is underway. Lucy and Mrs. Walker (the cook) are busy. Guests arrive, announced by Wilkin, including Lady and Miss Lovejoy, Sir John and Lady Needham, and Peter Walsh. Clarissa greets everyone, but feels the party might be a failure. She sees Peter criticizing her. **Ellie Henderson**, Clarissa's poor cousin, feels out of place. Richard and Peter greet each other. Sally Seton (now **Lady Rosseter**) arrives, surprising Clarissa, and they embrace. Sally, now a wealthy mother of five sons, and Peter reminisce.

The Prime Minister arrives, causing a stir among the guests. Peter Walsh observes the ""snobbery of the English"" and Hugh Whitbread's fawning. Clarissa escorts the Prime Minister, feeling an ""intoxication"" but also a ""hollowness."" She suddenly thinks of Miss Kilman, her ""enemy,"" and feels that hatred is ""real.""

Lady Bradshaw approaches Clarissa, mentioning, in a lowered voice, a ""very sad case"": a young man had killed himself, a former soldier. Clarissa is shocked by this news of death at her party. She retreats to a small room, reflecting on the young man's suicide. She imagines his fall and the rusty spikes. She connects his act to a defiance against the impossibility of communication and the loneliness of life, seeing an ""embrace in death."" She wonders if men like Sir William Bradshaw, who make life ""intolerable"" by forcing one's soul, drove him to it. She feels a connection to the young man's despair, seeing his death as ""her disaster--her disgrace.""

Clarissa walks to the window and sees the old lady opposite going to bed, pulling down her blind. The clock strikes. Clarissa feels a profound connection to the young man who killed himself, feeling ""glad that he had done it; thrown it away."" She feels his act made her feel ""the beauty; made her feel the fun."" She knows she must return to her party, to Sally and Peter.

Peter Walsh, sitting on the sofa with Sally, wonders where Clarissa has gone. Sally and Peter discuss Clarissa, her snobbery, and her marriage to Richard. Sally reveals her own happy marriage and five sons. Peter admits his life was ""spoilt"" by his relationship with Clarissa. They discuss the Bradshaws, whom Peter calls ""damnable humbugs."" Peter reflects on how maturity allows for deeper understanding and feeling. Richard Dalloway, talking to the Bradshaws, realizes with pride and love that the beautiful young woman he is observing is his daughter, Elizabeth. Sally goes to talk to Richard, asserting the importance of the heart over the brain. Peter, feeling ""terror"" and ""ecstasy,"" realizes it is Clarissa who fills him with this extraordinary excitement. The story concludes with Peter's thought, ""For there she was."""
Pride and Prejudice-Jane Austen,"The story begins with the universally acknowledged truth that a single man of good fortune must be in want of a wife. This sentiment is particularly strong in the Bennet family, where Mrs. Bennet is eager to marry off her five daughters. She is thrilled to learn that Netherfield Park has been let to a wealthy young man named Mr. Bingley, who has an income of four or five thousand a year. Mrs. Bennet immediately sets her sights on him marrying one of her daughters, urging her husband, Mr. Bennet, to visit him. Mr. Bennet, a man of sarcastic humor and reserve, initially feigns disinterest but secretly makes the visit.

At the first public assembly in Meryton, Mr. Bingley proves to be amiable, lively, and dances frequently, showing particular admiration for Jane Bennet, the eldest daughter. He is accompanied by his two sisters, Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, and his friend, Mr. Darcy. Mr. Darcy, a very wealthy man with ten thousand a year, initially draws attention for his handsome appearance but quickly earns a reputation for being proud and disagreeable due to his reserved manners and refusal to dance with most ladies. Elizabeth Bennet, the second daughter, overhears Mr. Darcy dismiss her as ""tolerable; but not handsome enough to tempt me,"" which instantly establishes her strong dislike for him. Despite this, the Bennet family is generally pleased with the evening, especially Mrs. Bennet, who is convinced Jane has captivated Mr. Bingley.

Jane and Elizabeth discuss the events, with Jane expressing her genuine admiration for Bingley, while Elizabeth, more discerning, remains wary of Bingley's proud sisters. Elizabeth also shares her strong negative opinion of Mr. Darcy, though her friend Charlotte Lucas suggests Darcy has a ""right"" to his pride due to his superior station. Mr. Wickham, a handsome and charming officer newly arrived in Meryton, soon captures Elizabeth's attention. He tells her a story of how Mr. Darcy, despite his father's dying wish, deprived him of a valuable church living and treated him cruelly out of jealousy. Elizabeth, already prejudiced against Darcy, readily believes Wickham and is filled with indignation against Darcy. She is further convinced of Darcy's villainy when she learns from Colonel Fitzwilliam, Darcy's cousin, that Darcy had ""saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage,"" which Elizabeth correctly deduces refers to Bingley and Jane. This revelation solidifies her belief that Darcy deliberately separated her beloved sister from Bingley due to the Bennets' lower social standing and connections.

Meanwhile, Mr. Collins, Mr. Bennet's pompous and obsequious cousin, arrives at Longbourn. As the entail heir, he will inherit the estate upon Mr. Bennet's death, leaving the daughters without a home. He proposes to Elizabeth, believing it his duty to make amends to the family. Elizabeth, however, finds him ridiculous and unequivocally refuses him. Mr. Collins, convinced her refusal is merely a feminine artifice, persists. Mrs. Bennet, desperate to secure a marriage for one of her daughters, tries to force Elizabeth to accept, but Mr. Bennet intervenes, declaring he will never see Elizabeth again if she *does* marry Collins. Mr. Collins, offended by Elizabeth's ""headstrong"" nature, then shifts his affections to Elizabeth's sensible but pragmatic friend, Charlotte Lucas. Charlotte, who prioritizes a comfortable home over romantic love, accepts Mr. Collins's proposal, much to Elizabeth's dismay and disappointment.

Bingley's sisters, particularly Miss Bingley, succeed in their efforts to keep Bingley away from Jane. They leave Netherfield for London, taking Bingley with them, and Miss Bingley writes to Jane, praising Miss Darcy and expressing hopes for a marriage between her and Bingley. Jane is heartbroken, though she tries to remain composed. Elizabeth, however, is convinced that Bingley still loves Jane and that his sisters and Darcy are manipulating him. To help Jane recover, Mrs. Gardiner, Elizabeth's aunt, invites Jane to stay with them in London.

Elizabeth, accompanying her aunt and uncle, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, on a summer tour, visits Pemberley, Mr. Darcy's estate in Derbyshire, after being assured he is absent. She is deeply impressed by the beauty of the estate and the glowing praise of Mr. Darcy from his housekeeper, Mrs. Reynolds, who describes him as a kind master and generous landlord. This contradicts everything Elizabeth has heard from Wickham and her own impressions. Unexpectedly, Mr. Darcy returns early and encounters Elizabeth and the Gardiners. To Elizabeth's astonishment, his manners are remarkably civil, gentle, and attentive, a stark contrast to his previous haughtiness. He even invites her and her relatives to dine at Pemberley and asks to introduce his sister, Georgiana Darcy, to Elizabeth.

This unexpected change in Darcy's behavior, coupled with the housekeeper's testimony, begins to soften Elizabeth's prejudice. She now sees Wickham's character in a new light, realizing his claims against Darcy were likely false. Her growing respect for Darcy is further solidified when Miss Bingley, visiting Pemberley, attempts to disparage Elizabeth to Darcy, only for Darcy to defend Elizabeth and declare her ""one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance.""

However, this period of newfound understanding is shattered by two urgent letters from Jane, revealing that Lydia has eloped with Mr. Wickham. The second letter confirms that Wickham has no intention of marrying Lydia and that they are likely living together in London without being married, bringing immense disgrace upon the Bennet family. Elizabeth is overcome with shame and self-reproach, realizing that if she had exposed Wickham's true character earlier (as revealed in Darcy's letter), this might have been prevented.

As Elizabeth is reeling from this news, Mr. Darcy unexpectedly appears. Overwhelmed, Elizabeth blurts out the entire story of Lydia's elopement. Darcy is shocked and grieved, but also expresses concern and offers his assistance. He then leaves, and Elizabeth believes their acquaintance is over due to her family's disgrace.

Mr. Gardiner travels to London to assist Mr. Bennet in finding Lydia. After a period of agonizing suspense, Mr. Gardiner writes to say that Lydia and Wickham have been found. They are not married, but Mr. Gardiner has negotiated a marriage, agreeing to pay Wickham's considerable debts (over £1,000) and settle an additional £1,000 on Lydia, in exchange for Wickham marrying her and joining a regiment in the north. Mr. Bennet is relieved but also mortified, realizing his brother-in-law has paid a large sum. He refuses to receive Lydia and Wickham at Longbourn or provide for Lydia's wedding clothes, but Jane and Elizabeth persuade him to allow them to visit after the marriage for the sake of appearances.

Lydia and Wickham return to Longbourn as a married couple. Lydia is completely unashamed and boasts incessantly about her wedding and her husband, much to Elizabeth's disgust. During a private conversation, Lydia accidentally reveals that Mr. Darcy was present at her wedding. Elizabeth, burning with curiosity, writes to Mrs. Gardiner for an explanation. Mrs. Gardiner's reply reveals the full extent of Darcy's involvement: he had tracked down Lydia and Wickham, bribed Mrs. Younge (Georgiana's former governess) for their location, confronted Wickham, and personally paid all of Wickham's debts and secured his commission, all to save the Bennet family from ruin. Darcy confessed to Mr. Gardiner that he felt responsible for Wickham's bad reputation not being widely known, due to his own pride and reserve. Elizabeth is overwhelmed with gratitude and realizes Darcy did all this for *her*. Her feelings for him transform into deep respect, esteem, and love.

Soon after, Mr. Bingley returns to Netherfield, accompanied by Mr. Darcy. Bingley, having been informed by Darcy of his mistaken belief about Jane's indifference, proposes to Jane, who joyfully accepts. Jane learns that Darcy had confessed his error in judgment and his interference in their relationship to Bingley, who, in turn, had heartily forgiven him.

Finally, Mr. Darcy proposes to Elizabeth again. Elizabeth, having overcome her prejudice and now fully understanding and loving him, accepts. She confesses her love for him, even admitting she loves him more than Jane loves Bingley. She also tells her father about Darcy's generous actions regarding Lydia. Mr. Bennet, initially surprised and skeptical, is convinced by Elizabeth's earnestness and Darcy's noble character, giving his consent. Mrs. Bennet is ecstatic, focusing on Darcy's wealth and status, and quickly forgets her past dislike of him.

Lady Catherine de Bourgh, having heard a rumor of Darcy's engagement to Elizabeth, makes an unannounced visit to Longbourn. She imperiously demands Elizabeth deny the engagement and promise never to marry Darcy, reminding her of Darcy's supposed engagement to Miss de Bourgh and the Bennet family's inferior connections and recent disgrace. Elizabeth, however, calmly and firmly refuses to be intimidated, asserting her right to choose her own happiness. Lady Catherine leaves in a rage. Darcy later reveals to Elizabeth that Lady Catherine's interference, far from dissuading him, actually gave him hope, as Elizabeth's frank defiance showed she was not entirely against him.

The story concludes with the marriages of Jane and Bingley, and Elizabeth and Darcy. Bingley and Jane eventually move to an estate closer to Pemberley. Kitty, removed from Lydia's influence, improves her character under the guidance of her elder sisters. Mary remains at home, forced to socialize more. Wickham and Lydia, however, remain extravagant and irresponsible, frequently needing financial assistance from Elizabeth and Darcy, who continue to help them for Elizabeth's sake. Miss Bingley, mortified by Darcy's marriage, drops her resentment and becomes civil to Elizabeth to maintain access to Pemberley. Lady Catherine, after a period of indignation, eventually reconciles with Darcy and Elizabeth, even visiting them at Pemberley. Darcy and Elizabeth maintain a close and grateful relationship with the Gardiners, acknowledging their role in bringing them together."
Robinson Crusoe-Daniel Defoe,"Robinson Crusoe begins his narrative by stating he was born in York in 1632 to a good family, his father being a German merchant. He had two elder brothers, one of whom died in a battle in Flanders, and the fate of the other is unknown. As the third son, Crusoe developed a strong desire to go to sea, against the earnest advice of his elderly father, who advocated for a stable ""middle state"" of life, warning that God would not bless him if he pursued a life of adventure. His mother also tried to dissuade him.

Despite his parents' pleas, Crusoe, at eighteen, decided to run away. He went to Hull and, without consulting his family, boarded a ship bound for London on September 1, 1651. Immediately, a violent storm arose, terrifying Crusoe and making him severely seasick. He repented his disobedience and vowed to return home if spared. However, once the storm abated, his companion mocked his fears, and after drinking punch, Crusoe forgot his resolutions.

A few days later, while anchored in Yarmouth Roads, another, more terrible storm struck. The ship sprang a leak, and the crew worked desperately at the pumps. Crusoe, overwhelmed, fainted. A rescue boat from another ship eventually took all eleven men aboard, just before their own vessel sank. They were driven ashore near Yarmouth, where they received humanitarian aid. The captain of the rescue boat, and his son (Crusoe's companion), again warned Crusoe against a seafaring life, attributing their misfortune to him. Despite this, shame prevented Crusoe from returning home, and he traveled to London, still determined to go to sea.

In London, Crusoe embarked on a voyage to Guinea, Africa, as a gentleman passenger. This first venture was successful; he learned navigation from the honest captain and returned with a significant profit of £300 from £40 invested. However, the captain died shortly after. Crusoe, with £200 left with the captain's widow, decided to make a second voyage to Guinea with the former mate, now captain. This voyage proved disastrous. Their ship was attacked and captured by a Turkish pirate from Sallee. Crusoe was taken as a slave by the pirate captain.

For two years, Crusoe was enslaved in Sallee, tending his master's garden or ship. He constantly plotted escape but found no opportunity until his master, short of money, began taking him and a young Moorish boy named Xury on fishing trips in the ship's pinnace. One day, when the master's planned guests canceled, Crusoe was ordered to go fishing with Xury and another Moorish man, Ismael (Muley). Crusoe secretly gathered provisions, three guns, powder, shot, tools, and a lump of beeswax for the boat. Once at sea, he tricked Muley into going farther out, then suddenly threw him overboard, threatening to shoot him if he returned to the boat. Muley, an excellent swimmer, swam for shore. Crusoe then secured Xury's loyalty with promises and threats.

Crusoe steered south along the African coast, avoiding land due to fear of Moors and wild beasts. After five days, he anchored in a river mouth. At night, they heard terrifying wild animal noises. The next day, a monstrous beast approached their boat, which Crusoe scared away with a gunshot. Needing water, Crusoe and Xury went ashore. Xury shot a hare-like creature for food and found fresh water. They later discovered a better water source up the creek. Continuing south, they encountered black, naked natives. Crusoe traded with them by signs for food. While there, he shot and killed a leopard that had run into the sea, astonishing the natives. He took the skin and received more provisions and water.

Crusoe continued sailing for eleven more days, rounding what he believed to be the Cape de Verde Islands. In a moment of despair, Xury spotted a Portuguese ship. Crusoe signaled distress and was rescued. The captain, a kind man, refused payment, bought Crusoe's boat for 80 pieces of eight, and agreed to free Xury in ten years if he converted to Christianity.

They arrived in Brazil, where Crusoe, with his remaining money, became a planter. He acquired land, a negro slave, and a European servant. His plantation thrived, producing tobacco. He sent for £100 of his money from London, which arrived in the form of useful English goods and tools, thanks to the Portuguese captain's honest stewardship. Crusoe became wealthy, but his ambition led him to agree to a secret slave-trading voyage to Guinea with other planters, despite having a prosperous life. He made a will, naming the Portuguese captain his heir.

On September 1, 1659, exactly eight years after his first ill-fated voyage, Crusoe set sail again. A violent hurricane struck, driving their ship for twelve days, killing one man and washing two overboard. The ship was disabled near the coast of Guiana. A second storm then hit, driving them westward, and the ship struck a sandbank. The crew launched a boat, but a massive wave overturned it, drowning everyone except Crusoe, who was carried to shore, bruised and half-dead, the sole survivor.

Crusoe found himself on a desolate island, without food, clothes, or weapons. He spent his first night in a tree for safety. The next day, he discovered the ship had floated closer to shore. He swam to it and began salvaging supplies, using spars and planks to build rafts. Over several trips, he brought ashore provisions (biscuit, rum, cheese, dried meat, corn), tools (carpenter's chest, grindstone, axes), arms (guns, pistols, powder, shot, swords), clothes, bedding, and even money (which he considered useless). The ship eventually broke apart and disappeared.

Crusoe established a fortified habitation under a rock, building a tent and digging a cave behind it. He created a strong palisade of stakes and cables. A lightning storm made him realize the danger to his gunpowder, so he spent a fortnight separating it into many small parcels and hiding them. He hunted goats, learning their habits. He accidentally discovered barley and rice growing from discarded poultry feed, which he carefully cultivated for future food. He learned the island's seasons (two rainy, two dry). He made baskets, pottery (learning to fire them hard), a wooden mortar and pestle for grinding corn, and sieves from old neckcloths. He also devised a method for baking bread.

After four years, Crusoe had a comfortable life, but his desire for escape remained. He built a large canoe, but it was too heavy to launch into the water. He then built a smaller periagua, which he successfully launched by digging a canal. He fitted it with a mast, sail, and rudder. He embarked on a cruise around the island but was caught in a strong current that swept him far out to sea. Terrified, he repented his ingratitude for his island life. A gentle breeze and a favorable eddy eventually allowed him to return to the island, landing on the northern shore. He resolved to abandon further sea ventures.

Back at his main dwelling, he was surprised to hear his parrot, Poll, calling his name, which he had taught it. He continued to improve his skills, making better pottery with a wheel and even a tobacco pipe. His gunpowder supply dwindled, prompting him to focus on breeding goats. He set traps and pitfalls, successfully catching three young kids, which he tamed. He built several strong, fenced enclosures for his growing flock, eventually having over forty goats, providing him with meat and milk, from which he learned to make butter and cheese.

In his twenty-third year, he was content, but one day, he discovered a single naked footprint on the sand. This filled him with extreme terror. He fortified his dwelling further, planting a thick grove of trees to conceal it, and moved his ammunition to a hidden cave. He spent two years in seclusion, constantly fearing savages. During this time, he discovered a natural cave, very deep and dark, which he made his secure retreat for powder and spare arms.

Later, in his twenty-fourth year, he saw a fire on the shore, confirming the presence of savages. He observed nine naked cannibals feasting on human flesh. He was filled with indignation and resolved to attack them, but his moral doubts returned. He decided to intervene only if Providence directed him. One morning, he saw five canoes and thirty savages on shore, with three prisoners. One prisoner, a white man, escaped and ran towards Crusoe's dwelling. Crusoe, with Friday, intervened, shooting two of the pursuers. The rescued savage knelt, signifying eternal servitude. Crusoe named him Friday. Friday, at Crusoe's command, killed the stunned savage with Crusoe's sword. They buried the bodies.

Friday proved to be a faithful, loving servant. Crusoe clothed him and built him a tent. He taught Friday English and instructed him in Christianity. Friday revealed that his nation (Caribbees) also ate men, but only prisoners of war, and that seventeen other white men (Spaniards) had been shipwrecked on their coast and were living peacefully with his people.

Crusoe now hoped to escape with Friday's help and the Spaniards. They built a large periagua, which Friday managed skillfully. Crusoe fitted it with a mast, sail, and rudder. The Spaniard and Friday's father departed in one of the canoes to retrieve the other Spaniards, after Crusoe made them swear allegiance and promise to sign a contract.

Eight days later, Friday reported three canoes, but Crusoe saw an English long-boat approaching, followed by an English ship at anchor. Crusoe felt a ""secret admonition"" of danger. He observed mutineers landing three prisoners. The mutineers carelessly let their boat get stranded by the tide. Crusoe, with Friday, approached the three prisoners, who turned out to be the ship's captain, his mate, and a passenger, marooned by the mutineers. Crusoe offered to help them recover the ship under two conditions: they would obey him on the island and provide him and Friday free passage to England. They agreed.

Crusoe, Friday, the captain, his mate, and the passenger, along with some loyal mutineers they had captured and converted, formed a small force. They attacked the mutineers on shore, killing some and capturing others. The captain, pretending Crusoe was the ""governor"" of the island with a large army, offered the remaining mutineers a choice: be taken to England for hanging or stay on the island. They chose to stay.

Crusoe left the remaining mutineers on the island with firearms, ammunition, tools, and instructions on how to live and manage the goats, and to treat the expected Spaniards well. He also left them garden seeds and peas.

On December 19, 1686, after twenty-eight years, two months, and nineteen days on the island, Crusoe departed with the captain, Friday, and the loyal crew. He took his goat-skin cap, umbrella, one parrot, and all his money as relics. He arrived in England on June 11, 1687, after thirty-five years of absence.

In England, he found his old widow benefactor alive but poor, whom he helped. His parents were dead, but he found two sisters and two nephews. The ship owners rewarded him with £200. He traveled to Lisbon to inquire about his Brazilian plantation and found his old Portuguese captain. He learned his plantation had thrived, making his partner rich, and that his share of the profits had been appropriated by the king and a monastery, as he was presumed dead. The old captain, who had managed some of his early profits, confessed to using some of Crusoe's money after his own shipwreck. Crusoe generously forgave the debt and granted the captain and his son annuities from the plantation.

Crusoe's wealth was restored, making him master of over £5000 sterling and an estate of over £1000 a year. He helped his family and the widow. He had an aversion to sea travel but eventually resolved to return to England by land through Spain and France. He traveled with an English gentleman, two English merchants, two Portuguese gentlemen, and five servants, including Friday. They faced severe winter weather and dangerous encounters with wolves and a bear in the Pyrenees, which Friday bravely handled.

He arrived safely at Dover on January 14. He settled in England, married, and had three children. His wife died. His nephew, now a ship captain, persuaded him to embark on another trading voyage to the East Indies in 1694. On this voyage, he revisited his island colony, finding the Spaniards had established a thriving community, faced conflicts with the mutineers he left, and fought several battles with Caribbeans, even taking prisoners. He found about twenty young children on the island. He stayed for twenty days, leaving them supplies, arms, tools, and two workmen. He shared the land and engaged them not to leave. From Brazil, he sent more people, including seven women, cows, sheep, and hogs to the island. He later learned the colony had faced a major Caribbee invasion but had ultimately recovered. He states he will recount further surprising adventures in the Second Part of his Story."
Six Characters in Search of an Author-Luigi Pirandello,"The play opens on a stage set for a rehearsal of a Pirandello play titled ""Mixing It Up."" The Manager is frustrated with the abstract nature of the play and the actors' performances. He gives instructions to the Property Man and Prompter, and the Leading Man complains about having to wear a cook's cap. The Manager, annoyed, explains the philosophical underpinnings of the play to the confused actors.

Suddenly, six mysterious figures—The Father, The Mother, The Step-Daughter, The Son, The Boy, and The Child—enter the stage, radiating a faint, dream-like light. They announce they are ""characters in search of an author"" because their creator abandoned them without completing their story. They implore the Manager to stage their drama, arguing that they are more real than the actors and that their suffering is genuine.

Initially, the Manager and actors are skeptical and dismissive, believing the characters are mad. However, The Father passionately explains the nature of characters having an eternal, fixed reality, unlike fleeting human existence. The Step-Daughter, vivacious and impudent, reveals parts of their tragic story, stating that she, The Boy, and The Child are ""bastards"" and that The Son, the legitimate child, despises them. The Mother, veiled in black, faints from anguish.

The Father explains that The Mother is his wife, but she had a lover (the Step-Daughter's deceased father). The Mother claims The Father forced her to leave him for the other man, but The Step-Daughter contradicts this, suggesting The Mother's guilt is tied to The Son's neglect. The Father admits he sent The Mother away, partly for her well-being and partly for his own liberation, driven by a desire for ""moral sanity."" The Step-Daughter scoffs at this, revealing The Father frequented Madame Pace's establishment, a brothel. She then drops a bombshell: The Father was about to pay her 100 lire for her services at Madame Pace's, a moment of horror for the actors.

The Father attempts to rationalize his actions with philosophical arguments about the subjective nature of reality and conscience. The Son expresses his disgust and shame, wanting no part in the drama, feeling like an ""unrealized character"" and an intruder in his own home. He accuses The Father of wanting to expose their private lives. The Father, however, insists The Son is central to the drama. He recounts how, after The Mother left, he became curious about her new family and would watch The Step-Daughter leave school, even giving her gifts.

The Step-Daughter continues the narrative, explaining that after her stepfather died, she, The Mother, The Boy, and The Child returned to the city in poverty. The Mother, unable to write, didn't contact The Father. The Mother found work as a modiste at Madame Pace's, unknowingly facilitating The Step-Daughter's exploitation. One day, The Father encountered The Step-Daughter at Madame Pace's, almost engaging in a shameful act, but recognized The Mother just in time. He then took them all into his home.

Intrigued, the Manager agrees to try and stage their story, instructing his Prompter to take notes. The actors are bewildered by this impromptu decision.

After a brief intermission, the characters emerge from the Manager's office. The Step-Daughter expresses her disdain for the Manager's attempts to stage their story, calling it ""nonsense"" and ""make-believe."" She finds a revolver on The Boy, suggesting he should have shot The Father and The Son instead of himself. The Son, meanwhile, laments the shame of having his family's private life exposed.

The Manager begins to set the stage for Madame Pace's shop, but The Step-Daughter insists on specific details like a yellow, flowered sofa and a mahogany table with a pale blue envelope. The Father and Step-Daughter argue with the Manager about the actors' ability to portray them authentically, asserting that their unique ""temperaments"" and ""souls"" cannot be replicated.

The Father then suggests that by setting the scene with props from Madame Pace's trade, Madame Pace herself might appear. To everyone's astonishment, Madame Pace, a comically elegant, rouged, and powdered old woman, enters the stage. The Step-Daughter immediately recognizes her. The Father is triumphant, declaring Madame Pace ""truer"" than any actress.

The Step-Daughter and Madame Pace begin their scene, but Madame Pace speaks in an unintelligible, comical jargon (half-Italian, half-Spanish). The Manager, initially alarmed, finds this ""magnificent"" for comic relief. The Mother, who had been quietly observing, suddenly erupts in fury, calling Madame Pace a ""devil"" and ""murderess."" The Father explains that The Mother and Madame Pace cannot be on stage together yet, as it ""gives away"" the plot. Madame Pace, offended, exits.

The Father and Step-Daughter then perform the scene where he encounters her at Madame Pace's. The Father, initially hesitant, becomes fully immersed in the role. He offers The Step-Daughter a hat, but she, in mourning, refuses, her disgust barely veiled. The Mother watches, sobbing in anguish. The Manager stops the scene, pleased, and the Leading Lady and Leading Man attempt to act it, but their interpretation is different, causing The Father and Step-Daughter to laugh and protest its inauthenticity.

The Step-Daughter insists on the ""truth"" of the scene, particularly The Father's line about taking off her dress, and her subsequent shame. The Manager is horrified, declaring such explicit truth ""won't go"" on stage, and that ""acting is our business here. Truth up to a certain point, but no further."" The Step-Daughter, enraged, threatens to leave, accusing him of conspiring with The Father to present a ""cerebral drama"" instead of her ""part."" She asserts that The Father is responsible for all her ""faults"" because of his initial actions. The Mother is overcome with emotion and cries.

The Mother then pleads not to relive her torment, explaining that her suffering is real and ongoing, and that the younger children ""do not exist, they aren't any more"" for themselves, but keep her torment vivid. The Father adds that The Step-Daughter is there to eternally fix him in his ""one fleeting and shameful moment.""

The Step-Daughter describes the physical details of her encounter with The Father, leaning on his breast, feeling a pulsing vein, and closing her eyes in disgust. She urges The Mother to ""Cry out as you did then!"" The Mother rushes forward, separating them, crying, ""You brute! She is my daughter!"" The Manager, pleased with the dramatic climax, calls for the curtain, which accidentally falls completely.

When the curtain rises again, the stage is set for a garden scene with trees and a fountain. The characters are positioned, still arguing with the Manager about the staging. The Step-Daughter insists on the Boy's indoor scenes and the impossibility of containing all action in the garden. The Father objects to the word ""illusion,"" explaining that for the actors, it's a ""game of art,"" but for the characters, it's their ""sole reality."" He provocatively asks the Manager, ""Can you tell me who you are?"" and argues that characters have a more fixed and eternal reality than humans.

The Manager grows increasingly frustrated with The Father's ""philosophizing"" and the characters' insistence on their truth. The Father defends his philosophizing as expressing his suffering. The Step-Daughter describes her only joy: seeing The Child playing happily in the garden, a stark contrast to their previous squalor. The Manager decides to stage everything in the garden, with The Boy hiding behind trees.

The Step-Daughter states The Boy won't speak as long as The Son is present, suggesting The Son be sent away. The Son eagerly agrees, but The Manager stops him. The Mother tries to prevent The Son from leaving. The Step-Daughter mockingly states The Son ""can't go away"" as he's ""indissolubly bound to the chain."" The Son, however, adamantly refuses to act, claiming he stands for the author's will not to stage them. The Father tries to force him.

The Manager presses The Son for his account of what happened. The Son, with great reluctance and gloom, reveals that after The Mother entered his room, he left to avoid a scene and walked in the garden. The Manager, sensing something, asks about ""The baby?"" The Son reveals The Child was ""there in the fountain."" The Father adds that The Mother was following The Son. The Son describes running to save The Child but seeing The Boy standing ""stock still, with eyes like a madman's, watching his little drowned sister, in the fountain!"" The Step-Daughter bends over the fountain, sobbing.

Suddenly, a revolver shot rings out from behind the trees where The Boy is hidden. The Mother screams and rushes towards the sound. Amidst general confusion, some actors cry, ""He's dead! dead!"" while others insist, ""No, no, it's only make believe, it's only pretence!"" The Father, with a terrible cry, shouts, ""Pretence? Reality, sir, reality!"" The Manager, utterly exasperated, exclaims, ""To hell with it all! Never in my life has such a thing happened to me. I've lost a whole day over these people, a whole day!""

The curtain falls."
The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn-Mark Twain,"The story begins with the narrator, Huckleberry Finn, introducing himself and referencing a previous book, *The Adventures of Tom Sawyer*, which detailed how he and Tom found money hidden by robbers in a cave, making them rich with six thousand dollars apiece. Judge Thatcher invested this money, providing them a dollar a day. The Widow Douglas adopted Huck to ""sivilize"" him, a life Huck found dismal. He briefly ran away but returned when Tom Sawyer promised he could join a band of robbers if he became respectable.

Living with the Widow, Huck endured strict routines, learned about Moses (losing interest when he found Moses was dead), and was forbidden to smoke by Miss Watson, the Widow's sister, who also tried to teach him spelling and manners. Huck found her talk of the ""good place"" unappealing, especially when he learned Tom Sawyer wouldn't be there. Feeling lonesome and scared by various omens, Huck was relieved when Tom Sawyer ""me-yowed"" for him, and he slipped out to meet Tom.

Tom and Huck tiptoed through the garden, where Huck tripped, alerting Jim, Miss Watson's enslaved man. Jim investigated but fell asleep. Tom wanted to tie Jim to a tree, but Huck refused. They stole candles from the kitchen, leaving five cents. Tom then played a trick on Jim by hanging his hat on a tree limb above him. Jim later embellished this into a tale of witches riding him across the state, making him a local celebrity among other enslaved people.

Huck, Tom, and other boys formed ""Tom Sawyer's Gang"" in a cave, taking a blood oath to keep secrets and kill anyone who betrayed them or harmed their families. When it was noted Huck had no family, he offered Miss Watson. They planned to be ""highwaymen,"" robbing and murdering, with some victims to be ""ransomed,"" a term Tom admitted he didn't understand but insisted on because it was ""in the books."" Little Tommy Barnes threatened to tell secrets but was bribed with five cents.

After a month, Huck resigned from the gang, as they only pretended to rob and kill. Tom tried to stage a grand robbery of ""Spanish merchants and A-rabs"" with elephants, but it turned out to be a Sunday-school picnic. Tom claimed it was ""enchantment"" by magicians. Huck tried to summon genies with a lamp and ring but failed, concluding Tom's stories were lies.

Months passed. Huck attended school and was slowly adjusting to the Widow's ways. One winter morning, he spilled salt, a bad omen. He then found tracks in the snow with a cross in the boot-heel, which he recognized as his Pap's. Frightened, Huck rushed to Judge Thatcher and insisted on giving him all his money ($6,000 plus interest), which the Judge ""bought"" for a dollar. That night, Huck consulted Jim's ""hair-ball"" for a fortune-telling, which predicted Pap's return and Huck's future troubles, and warned him to stay away from water to avoid being ""hung."" Upon returning to his room, Huck found Pap waiting for him.

Pap, a ragged, sickly-looking man, confronted Huck, criticizing his education and ""starchy clothes."" He demanded Huck's money. Huck denied having it, but Pap took the dollar Huck had from the Judge. Pap got drunk and cursed Huck. The next day, Pap tried to get Huck's money from Judge Thatcher. The Judge and Widow tried to get legal guardianship of Huck, but a new judge refused to separate father and son. Pap was pleased, but continued to demand money from Huck, leading to Huck borrowing from the Judge, which Pap used to get drunk and jailed. The new judge attempted to reform Pap, but Pap quickly relapsed, trading his new clothes for whiskey, breaking his arm in a fall, and nearly freezing to death.

Pap recovered and continued to demand Huck's money and prevent him from going to school. He eventually abducted Huck, taking him three miles upriver to a secluded log hut on the Illinois shore. Pap kept Huck locked in, often leaving him alone for days while he went to town to trade fish for whiskey, returning to get drunk and beat Huck. Huck initially enjoyed the freedom from ""sivilizing"" but soon grew tired of the abuse and isolation. He found an old saw and began cutting a hole in the cabin wall.

One night, Pap returned drunk and had a fit of delirium tremens, screaming about snakes and devils, and chasing Huck with a knife, threatening to kill him. Huck narrowly escaped by slipping out of his jacket. When Pap collapsed, Huck got the gun and waited. The next morning, Pap was sober and didn't remember his rampage. Huck lied about the gun, claiming he was guarding against an intruder.

Huck found a drifting canoe and hid it, planning his escape. He finished sawing the hole in the cabin. While Pap was in town selling logs, Huck loaded the canoe with supplies. He then staged his own ""murder"" by smashing the cabin door, killing a wild pig and hacking its throat with an ax, dragging a sack of rocks to the river to simulate a body, and leaving pig's blood and his hair on the ax. He also made a trail of cornmeal to a nearby lake to mislead pursuers. He then slipped away in the canoe. He overheard men discussing his ""murder"" and the search for his body. He reached Jackson's Island and hid.

On Jackson's Island, Huck saw the ferryboat firing a cannon over the river, trying to make his ""carcass"" float. He caught a loaf of bread, which he believed was guided by the Widow's prayers. He watched the ferryboat, seeing Pap, Judge Thatcher, Tom Sawyer, and others, all discussing his supposed murder. He then saw the boat search the Missouri side of the island. Later, exploring the island, Huck found a still-smoking campfire. Frightened, he hid. He later returned to the campfire at dawn and discovered Miss Watson's Jim.

Jim, terrified, initially thought Huck was a ghost. Huck reassured him. Jim revealed he had run away after overhearing Miss Watson planning to sell him to New Orleans for $800. He had been hiding on the island since the night Huck was ""killed,"" surviving on berries. Jim had seen the ferryboat searching for Huck. He shared his knowledge of signs and recounted his past financial misfortunes. He proudly declared himself ""rich now"" because he ""owns [him]self"" and is ""wuth eight hund’d dollars.""

Huck and Jim moved their camp to a large cavern on a ridge for better shelter. A severe storm hit, causing the river to rise for days. They found a section of a lumber raft and later boarded a drifting two-story frame-house. Inside, they found a dead man, naked and shot in the back, whom Jim covered. They salvaged many items, including money, clothes, and tools. Huck made Jim hide in the canoe as they paddled to avoid being seen.

Jim warned Huck that touching a snake-skin brought bad luck. Huck, ignoring this, put a dead rattlesnake on Jim's blanket as a prank, leading to its mate biting Jim. Jim suffered from a swollen foot and leg for four days. Huck felt guilty.

Huck, bored, decided to go to a nearby town for news, disguised as a girl named ""Sarah Williams."" He met Mrs. Judith Loftus, who had recently moved to town. Mrs. Loftus told Huck that people initially suspected Pap of killing him, but then believed it was Jim, who had run away the night Huck was ""killed."" She mentioned a $300 reward for Jim and $200 for Pap. She also revealed that her husband and another man planned to search Jackson's Island for Jim after midnight, having seen smoke there. Huck, realizing Jim was in danger, made several slips in his disguise, revealing he was a boy. Mrs. Loftus, a shrewd woman, saw through his lies but, believing him to be a runaway apprentice, gave him advice and let him go. Huck rushed back to the island, warned Jim, and they quickly loaded their raft and escaped downstream in the dark.

They hid the raft by day, covered with cottonwood branches. Huck told Jim about Mrs. Loftus. Jim praised her cleverness and speculated the men lost time getting a dog. They drifted for days, observing river life and passing towns. Huck regularly ""borrowed"" food from shore. Jim's desire to buy his family out of slavery troubled Huck's conscience, making him feel guilty for helping Jim escape. He almost decided to turn Jim in but was swayed by Jim's loyalty and friendship.

One night, a steamboat smashed their raft. Huck and Jim were separated. Huck, after diving and swimming, found a plank and made it to the Illinois shore. He found a large log house and was confronted by barking dogs. A man from the house, Colonel Grangerford, cautiously let him in. Huck introduced himself as ""George Jackson"" and invented a story about falling off a steamboat. He was taken in by the Grangerford family, who were wealthy and refined. He became friends with Buck Grangerford, a boy his age.

Huck learned about the Grangerford-Shepherdson feud, a thirty-year-long cycle of revenge killings. Buck explained how his cousin Bud was killed by a Shepherdson, and how their family retaliated. One Sunday, after a church sermon on brotherly love, Miss Sophia Grangerford secretly asked Huck to retrieve her Testament from church. Inside, Huck found a note with ""Half past two."" He returned it to Sophia, who was overjoyed. Later, Jim, who had been following Huck, revealed himself. He had been hiding in a swamp near the Grangerford house, fed by other enslaved people, and had patched up the raft.

The next morning, Huck learned that Miss Sophia had eloped with young Harney Shepherdson, leading to a violent confrontation between the two families. Huck witnessed a shootout at the steamboat landing, where Buck and his cousin Joe were ambushed by Shepherdsons. Both boys were shot and fell into the river. Huck, sickened, stayed in a tree until dark, blaming himself for the tragedy due to his role in Sophia's elopement. He found Buck's and Joe's bodies and covered their faces. He then found Jim and the raft, and they escaped the feuding country, feeling free on the Mississippi.

Two days later, they encountered two con men on the river, fleeing a mob. The younger man claimed to be the rightful Duke of Bridgewater, and the older claimed to be the ""late Dauphin,"" Louis XVII of France. Huck quickly realized they were frauds but decided to play along to avoid conflict.

The king and duke, as they called themselves, learned about Huck and Jim's story. Huck invented a new one: his family died, leaving him and his ""nigger"" Jim, and they were going to New Orleans when a steamboat destroyed their raft, killing his Pap and brother. He claimed people kept trying to take Jim, so they traveled at night. The duke devised a plan for daytime travel: print a handbill claiming Jim was a captured runaway, allowing them to pretend they were returning him for a reward.

They arrived at a small Arkansaw town. The duke printed show-bills for a Shakespearean performance, featuring himself as Romeo/Richard III and the king as Juliet/Hamlet. The king also worked a camp-meeting, pretending to be a reformed pirate and collecting $87.75 and a jug of whiskey. The duke made $9.50 from printing.

In town, they witnessed a drunken man, Boggs, threatening Colonel Sherburn. Sherburn calmly warned Boggs, then shot him dead when Boggs continued his threats. A mob formed to lynch Sherburn, but he faced them down from his porch roof, calling them cowards and telling them to go home. The mob dispersed.

That night, the Shakespeare show was a failure. The duke decided the town wanted ""low comedy."" He printed new bills for ""The King's Cameleopard, or The Royal Nonesuch,"" with ""LADIES AND CHILDREN NOT ADMITTED."" The show was a success, with the king prancing naked and painted. The audience, realizing they were conned, decided to ""sell the rest of the town"" by praising the show so everyone would be in the same boat. The second night was also a success. On the third night, Huck noticed the audience bringing rotten food and dead cats, planning revenge. The duke and Huck slipped away, leaving the king to face the mob. The king soon joined them, having also escaped. They had made $465.

Jim questioned Huck about kings being ""rapscallions,"" and Huck agreed, citing historical examples. Jim then recounted a painful memory of slapping his deaf and dumb daughter, 'Lizabeth, before realizing her condition.

The frauds continued their schemes, but with little success. They were nearly broke. They began to conspire. Huck and Jim grew uneasy, fearing worse ""deviltry,"" and planned to abandon them. One morning, the king went ashore alone. Huck and the duke later found him drunk and being mocked by loafers. Huck seized the chance to escape with Jim, but found Jim gone. A boy told Huck that Jim had been captured and was at Silas Phelps's place, two miles below, sold by an old stranger for $40.

Huck was deeply conflicted. He considered writing to Miss Watson to return Jim but realized it would lead to Jim being sold further south and shamed. His conscience tormented him for helping Jim. He tried to pray but couldn't, realizing he was still holding onto the ""sin"" of helping Jim. He then decided, ""All right, then, I’ll _go_ to hell""—and tore up the letter he had written to Miss Watson. He resolved to ""take up wickedness again"" and steal Jim out of slavery.

Huck went to the Phelps plantation, planning to rescue Jim. He was mistaken for Tom Sawyer by Aunt Sally Phelps, who was expecting Tom. Huck played along, inventing stories about his journey. Uncle Silas Phelps, Aunt Sally's husband, had been to town looking for ""Tom."" Aunt Sally was worried about ""Tom"" (Huck) and ""Sid"" (the real Tom).

Huck met the real Tom Sawyer on the road. Tom, initially thinking Huck was a ghost, was thrilled by the ""adventure."" Huck explained his predicament. Tom, surprisingly, agreed to help steal Jim. Tom then pretended to be ""Sid Sawyer"" (his brother) at the Phelps house.

At the Phelps house, Huck and Tom learned that Jim was indeed imprisoned in a hut by the ash-hopper. Tom, rejecting Huck's simple plan to steal the key, insisted on an elaborate, ""romantic"" escape plan, full of unnecessary difficulties from adventure books. This involved digging Jim out with case-knives (later picks, pretending they were knives), making a rope ladder from sheets (smuggled in a pie), creating pens from a pewter spoon and candlestick (for Jim to keep a journal in blood on a shirt), and collecting various ""dumb pets"" (rats, snakes, spiders, frogs) for Jim's cell. Aunt Sally was driven to distraction by the missing items and the constant appearance of snakes.

After three weeks, the escape preparations were complete. Uncle Silas planned to advertise Jim in St. Louis and New Orleans papers, prompting Tom to accelerate the escape. Tom wrote anonymous warning letters to the Phelps family, claiming to be a reformed member of a gang planning to steal Jim. The letters described the gang's plan to arrive at midnight with a false key, and instructed the Phelpses to ambush them.

On the night of the escape, Huck was sent to the cellar for butter and was caught by Aunt Sally, who thought he had ""brain-fever"" when she saw the melting butter on his forehead. He was sent to bed. He and Tom then learned the house was full of armed farmers, waiting for the ""gang."" Tom, Jim, and Huck narrowly escaped the cabin as the farmers entered. They ran for the river, pursued by the farmers and dogs. Their own dogs, recognizing them, ignored them and ran after the farmers. Huck, Jim, and Tom reached the canoe and then the raft.

Tom revealed he had been shot in the leg. Jim refused to move the raft without a doctor. Huck went for a doctor, inventing a story about Tom accidentally shooting himself on ""Spanish Island."" The doctor, a kind old man, agreed to help. Tom gave Huck elaborate instructions on how to blindfold and mislead the doctor to prevent him from discovering Jim or the raft.

Huck returned to the Phelps house, pretending to be searching for ""Sid."" Aunt Sally and Uncle Silas were worried. The doctor eventually arrived with Tom on a mattress, and Jim, tied and dressed in Aunt Sally's calico dress. Some farmers wanted to hang Jim, but the doctor intervened, praising Jim's loyalty and skill in nursing Tom, even risking his freedom. He called Jim ""a better nuss or faithfuler"" and worth ""a thousand dollars."" The men agreed not to be rough on Jim.

Tom, recovering, proudly revealed to Aunt Sally the entire elaborate escape plan, including all the stolen items and the ""fun"" they had. Aunt Sally was furious but then Tom dropped a bombshell: Miss Watson had died two months ago and freed Jim in her will. Tom explained he wanted the ""adventure"" of setting a free man free. Just then, Tom's Aunt Polly arrived, confirming Jim's freedom and revealing that Huck had been impersonating Tom. Aunt Polly also revealed that Tom had intercepted her letters to Aunt Sally, explaining his absence.

In the end, Huck asked Tom why he went through all that trouble for an already free Jim. Tom explained his plan was to have adventures downriver, then reveal Jim's freedom, take him back in style, pay him, and make him a hero. Jim was freed and received forty dollars from Tom for his patience. Jim declared his hairy breast prophecy of wealth had come true. Tom then suggested they go for more adventures among the ""Injuns"" in the territory. Huck said he had no money, assuming Pap had taken it. Tom revealed that Pap never returned and all of Huck's money was still with Judge Thatcher. Jim then revealed that the dead man they found in the floating house (Chapter IX) was Pap, and he had covered his face to spare Huck.

Huck concludes the story by stating he is ""rotten glad"" the book is over and plans to ""light out for the territory ahead of the rest"" because Aunt Sally is going to adopt him and ""sivilize"" him, and he ""can’t stand it."" He's ""been there before."""
The Count of Monte Cristo-Alexandre Dumas,"The story begins on February 24, 1815, with the three-master *Pharaon* arriving in Marseilles. Edmond Dantès, the young and capable first mate, reports to the shipowner, M. Morrel, that their brave Captain Leclere died at sea. Morrel is pleased with Dantès' performance and promises him the captaincy of the *Pharaon* upon its next voyage, pending his partner's approval. Danglars, the supercargo, is envious of Dantès' rapid promotion and secretly dislikes him.

Dantès visits his aging father, who is living in poverty, having spent the money Edmond left him on a debt to their neighbor, Caderousse. Edmond is distressed by his father's condition. Caderousse, a tailor, soon arrives, having heard of Edmond's return from Danglars. He is openly envious of Edmond's good fortune.

Dantès then goes to the Catalan village to see his beloved fiancée, Mercédès. He finds her with her cousin, Fernand Mondego, who is deeply in love with Mercédès and desperately wants to marry her. Mercédès, however, firmly states her love for Edmond and her intention to marry only him. Edmond arrives, and he and Mercédès embrace. Fernand, consumed by jealousy, is forced by Mercédès to shake Edmond's hand before he flees in a rage.

Fernand meets Danglars and Caderousse at a tavern. Danglars, exploiting Fernand's despair and Caderousse's drunkenness, devises a plot. He writes an anonymous letter, disguised with his left hand, accusing Edmond Dantès of being a Bonapartist agent, carrying a letter from Napoleon (the ""usurper"") to a Bonapartist committee in Paris, and another from Murat. He claims the letter can be found on Dantès, at his father's house, or in his cabin. Danglars pretends to discard the letter, but Fernand retrieves it.

The next day, at Edmond and Mercédès' wedding feast at La Réserve, soldiers and a magistrate arrive and arrest Edmond Dantès. M. Morrel attempts to intervene, believing it a mistake, but the magistrate is firm. Old Dantès is distraught. Mercédès cries out to Edmond as he is taken away. M. Morrel leaves to investigate. Caderousse, realizing the ""joke"" has gone too far, tries to confess to Danglars, but Danglars silences him, warning that any involvement would make them accomplices. Fernand, the true instigator, has disappeared. M. Morrel returns with the devastating news that Dantès is accused of being a Bonapartist agent.

Dantès is taken to the Palais de Justice for examination by M. de Villefort, the deputy procureur du roi. Villefort, an ambitious royalist, is the son of Noirtier, a prominent Jacobin and Bonapartist. Dantès, unaware of the true nature of the accusation, calmly explains his stop at the Island of Elba was to fulfill Captain Leclere's dying wish to deliver a packet to Marshal Bertrand, and that he received a letter for a ""Monsieur Noirtier"" in Paris. Villefort is horrified to discover the letter is addressed to his own father, which would compromise his career. He burns the letter and makes Dantès swear never to mention Noirtier's name, promising him freedom.

However, instead of being freed, Dantès is transferred to the Château d’If, a formidable island prison. He attempts to escape by throwing himself into the sea but is restrained and thrown into a dark, underground dungeon. He is tormented by despair, but eventually hears a scratching sound in the wall. He discovers a fellow prisoner, the Abbé Faria, has been digging a tunnel.

Faria, an old, learned Italian priest, reveals he was imprisoned in 1811 for his political ideas about uniting Italy. He is considered mad by the jailers because he claims to know of an immense treasure. Faria teaches Dantès history, science, philosophy, and languages. He helps Dantès deduce the truth behind his imprisonment: Danglars' envy, Fernand's jealousy, and Villefort's ambition. Faria reveals that Villefort burned the letter because it was addressed to his own father, Noirtier, a known Bonapartist, and would have ruined Villefort's career.

Faria suffers a third paralytic attack, which he knows will be fatal. He makes Dantès memorize the location of his treasure on the Island of Monte Cristo, a fortune of nearly two million Roman crowns. He tells Dantès to escape alone, as he is now too weak. Dantès, devoted to Faria, promises never to leave him. Faria dies.

Dantès, in a desperate act, swaps places with Faria's corpse in the winding sheet. The grave-diggers, unaware, throw him into the sea with a 36-pound cannonball tied to his feet. Underwater, Dantès uses a knife (made by Faria) to cut himself free. He swims to the uninhabited Island of Tiboulen. He is rescued by a Genoese smuggling vessel, *La Jeune Amélie*, and pretends to be a shipwrecked Maltese sailor. He learns that 14 years have passed (it is now 1829). He renews his vow of vengeance.

Dantès, now wealthy from the treasure of Monte Cristo, returns to Marseilles in disguise as ""Lord Wilmore"" and ""Sinbad the Sailor."" He tests his changed appearance on old acquaintances, who do not recognize him. He learns his father died of hunger and Mercédès has disappeared. He secretly helps M. Morrel, who is on the verge of bankruptcy, by sending him a red silk purse containing a receipt for his debts and a diamond, signed ""Sinbad the Sailor."" He also arranges for a new *Pharaon* to arrive, saving Morrel's business and honor.

In Paris, Monte Cristo (Dantès) establishes himself as a mysterious, immensely wealthy count. He meets Albert de Morcerf (Mercédès' son), Danglars (now a baron and powerful banker), and Villefort (now a king's attorney). He orchestrates events to expose their past crimes.

He invites Danglars and the Villeforts to dinner at his house in Auteuil, which he bought specifically because it was the scene of Villefort's crime. During dinner, he reveals that a skeleton of a newborn infant was found in the garden, terrifying Villefort and Madame Danglars, who are the child's parents.

He also arranges for Major Cavalcanti and his ""son"" Andrea (Benedetto, the child Villefort buried alive) to be introduced into Parisian society, with Danglars as their banker. Andrea, a former galley-slave, is Caderousse's accomplice in the murder of a jeweller.

Albert de Morcerf's father, Fernand, is publicly exposed in the House of Peers for betraying Ali Pasha of Yanina, Haydée's father. Haydée, now Monte Cristo's adopted daughter, testifies against Fernand, confirming his treachery and sale of her and her mother into slavery. Fernand is disgraced. Albert, devastated by his father's dishonor, challenges Monte Cristo to a duel. Mercédès, recognizing Edmond, pleads with him to spare her son. Edmond, moved by her anguish, agrees to die in the duel. However, Albert, learning the full truth of his father's crimes and Edmond's suffering, publicly apologizes to Monte Cristo and renounces his father's name and fortune. Fernand, witnessing his family's ruin, commits suicide. Mercédès leaves Albert to live a life of humility in Marseilles, taking the money Edmond buried for her.

Madame de Villefort, driven by her ambition for her son Edward, has been poisoning her family members to secure inheritances for him. She poisoned M. and Madame de Saint-Méran (Valentine's grandparents) and Barrois (Noirtier's servant). Valentine is also poisoned, but Noirtier, aware of his wife's crimes, has secretly given Valentine increasing doses of brucine, making her immune. Monte Cristo intervenes, giving Valentine a narcotic that simulates death. She is placed in the family vault. Maximilian Morrel, Valentine's lover, is distraught and plans to commit suicide. Monte Cristo reveals his true identity as Edmond Dantès to Maximilian, prevents his suicide, and reveals Valentine is alive.

Villefort, having publicly confessed his paternity of Benedetto, returns home to confront his wife. He finds her dead, having poisoned herself and Edward. Villefort goes mad, digging frantically in the garden for the child he buried alive.

Danglars, having lost millions through Monte Cristo's manipulations, flees to Rome. He is kidnapped by Luigi Vampa's bandits (orchestrated by Monte Cristo). Vampa forces Danglars to pay for food and water with his remaining millions, slowly depleting his fortune. When Danglars has only 50,000 francs left, Monte Cristo reveals himself as Edmond Dantès. He tells Danglars he is forgiven, gives him the remaining 50,000 francs, and says the 5 million stolen from the hospitals have been restored. Danglars is left destitute and his hair turns white from shock.

Monte Cristo, having completed his vengeance, feels a profound melancholy. He revisits the Château d’If and his old dungeon, reflecting on his past suffering and the justice he has wrought. He finds Faria's manuscript, which contains the epigraph: ""Thou shalt tear out the dragons’ teeth, and shall trample the lions under foot, saith the Lord."" He realizes his mission is complete.

He returns to Marseilles, where he finds Maximilian Morrel at Valentine's grave. He reveals Valentine is alive and waiting for him on the Island of Monte Cristo. He gives Maximilian his house in the Champs-Élysées, his château at Tréport, and the remaining millions of his fortune as a wedding gift for him and Valentine. He asks Valentine to give her father's and brother's fortune to the poor. He tells Maximilian and Valentine to ""Wait and hope.""

Monte Cristo, accompanied by Haydée, departs on his yacht, the *Eurus*, leaving France behind. He has found love with Haydée, who declared she would die if he left her. He feels God has pardoned him, and through Haydée, he ""again takes hold on life."""

**PROEM**
The author, having experienced great suffering from a high and noble passion in his youth, found comfort in the pleasant discourse and consolations of a friend. Now that his passion has abated, leaving only a gentle pleasure, he feels gratitude for the comfort received. To reciprocate, he aims to offer solace to those in need, particularly lovesick ladies, who are more constrained and vulnerable to melancholy than men. For their succour and solace, he purposes to recount one hundred stories, or fables, or histories, told over ten days by an honorable company of seven ladies and three young men, formed during the late deadly pestilence. These stories will contain both joyful and grievous love-chances and other accidents of fortune, offering both solace and useful counsel.

**Day the First**
**Introduction**
The author addresses gracious ladies, acknowledging the grievous beginning of his work due to the dolorous remembrance of the pestilence of 1348 in Florence. He compares this beginning to a rugged mountain, beyond which lies a delightful plain. The Black Death, sent by God's wrath, appeared in the East and spread to the West. In Florence, it manifested as plague-boils and black blotches, leading to death within three days for most. Neither physicians nor medicine availed, and the contagion spread rapidly, even to animals touching infected items.
This terror led to various behaviors: some isolated themselves in clean houses, living temperately with music; others caroused and satisfied every appetite, avoiding the sick. A middle group used aromatic herbs to fortify themselves. Many fled the city, abandoning homes and kin. The laws dissolved, as ministers were dead or sick. The sick were abandoned by family and friends, leading to women being tended by men without shame, which might have led to lesser modesty in survivors. Deaths were innumerable, bodies were left in streets, and burials became hasty and undignified in mass graves. The countryside was also afflicted, with husbandmen dying like beasts and fields left untended. Over 100,000 people perished in Florence between March and July.
Amidst this misery, seven young ladies, aged eighteen to twenty-eight, discreet, noble, fair, and sprightly, foregathered in Santa Maria Novella church one Tuesday morning. Their names are Pampinea, Fiammetta, Filomena, Emilia, Lauretta, Neifile, and Elisa. Pampinea suggests they leave the afflicted city for their country estates, to live with diversion and pleasure, avoiding the dishonorable conduct of others. Filomena agrees but advises they need male guidance, as women are fickle and ill-ordered without it. Elisa concurs, noting most of their male kin have fled.
At this moment, three young men enter the church: Pamfilo, Filostrato, and Dioneo, all agreeable and well-bred, seeking their mistresses (three of whom are among the ladies). Pampinea suggests they invite these men to be their guides. Neifile expresses concern about scandal due to their known affections. Filomena dismisses this, saying honesty will protect them. The ladies agree, and Pampinea invites the young men to join them in a pure and brotherly spirit. The men, initially thinking it a jest, joyfully accept.

**The Company's Departure and Establishment**
On Wednesday morning, the company, with their servants, departs Florence. They arrive at a beautiful palace on a hill, with gardens, cool wells, and fine wines. Dioneo urges them to live merrily. Pampinea proposes they elect a chief daily to ensure their joyous living, with the role alternating between sexes. She is elected the first chief, and Filomena crowns her with a laurel wreath. Pampinea then assigns duties to the servants and dismisses the company to enjoy the gardens.
At nine o'clock, they return for a magnificent dinner, served orderly with music. After dinner, Dioneo plays the lute, Fiammetta the viol, and the company dances and sings. They then retire for a midday nap.
After three o'clock, Pampinea calls them to the meadows, where she proposes they tell stories to pass the hot part of the day, rather than play games. All agree. Pampinea, as queen, declares that for this first day, each may tell a story of their own liking. She bids Pamfilo begin.

**Story 1: Master Ciappelletto**
Pamfilo begins with a story about God's benevolence. Musciatto Franzesi, a Florentine merchant in France, needs to collect debts from quarrelsome Burgundians. He remembers Master Ciappelletto da Prato, a notorious villain known for false witness, blasphemy, murder, and general wickedness, whom the French call Ciappelletto. Musciatto hires Ciappelletto, who travels to Burgundy and lodges with two Florentine brothers, usurers. Ciappelletto falls mortally ill. The brothers worry that if he dies unconfessed, no church will bury him, and his wicked reputation will endanger their business. Ciappelletto, overhearing their fears, promises to handle it. He asks them to bring the holiest friar they can find.
A venerable, learned friar arrives. Ciappelletto, who has never confessed, claims to confess weekly. He then fabricates a confession, presenting himself as a man of extreme piety. He claims to be a virgin, to fast three days a week (only drinking water with appetite after pilgrimage), to have given most of his inheritance to charity, to be angered only by men's sins against God, and to have only once ""missaid"" of a neighbor who beat his wife. His greatest sin, he tearfully confesses, is cursing his mother as a child. The friar, believing him a saint, absolves him and asks for his body to be buried in the convent. Ciappelletto agrees. The brothers, hidden, overhear the confession and are astonished by his deceit but relieved he will be buried.
Ciappelletto receives the sacrament and extreme unction, then dies. The friars hold a solemn vigil and funeral. The confessor preaches, extolling Ciappelletto's sanctity, virginity, and innocence, recounting his ""greatest sin."" The people are convinced, flocking to kiss his body and tearing his clothes for relics. He is honorably buried in a marble tomb and becomes known as Saint Ciappelletto, with many miracles attributed to him. Pamfilo concludes that God, regarding the purity of the suppliant's intent rather than the ignorance or reprobate state of the intercessor, grants prayers even through a wicked man.

**Story 2: Abraham the Jew**
Neifile tells of Jehannot de Chevigné, a Parisian merchant, and his friend Abraham, a rich and honest Jew. Jehannot tries to convert Abraham to Christianity. Abraham, after much insistence, agrees to consider it but first insists on visiting Rome to observe the Pope, Cardinals, and clergy. Jehannot is dismayed, fearing Abraham will be repulsed by the depravity of the Roman court and never convert.
Abraham travels to Rome and observes the clergy, from highest to lowest, engaged in lust (natural and sodomitical), gluttony, drunkenness, and avarice. He sees them selling sacred things and church benefices, calling simony ""procuration"" and gluttony ""sustentation."" Disgusted, he returns to Paris.
Jehannot, expecting Abraham to be more entrenched in Judaism, asks about his trip. Abraham declares the Roman court a ""forgingplace of things diabolical rather than divine,"" where the clergy actively tries to destroy Christianity. However, he notes that despite their efforts, the Christian religion continually increases and shines brighter. He concludes that the Holy Spirit must be its true foundation, making it the true and holy faith. Therefore, he is now determined to become a Christian. Jehannot is overjoyed and has Abraham baptized, naming him Giovanni. Giovanni becomes a good and devout Christian.

**Story 3: Melchizedek the Jew**
Filomena recounts how good sense can extricate one from peril. Saladin, Soldan of Babylon, having depleted his treasury, needs money. He targets Melchizedek, a rich but miserly Jew in Alexandria, whom he is reluctant to force. Saladin summons Melchizedek and asks which of the three Laws (Jewish, Saracen, Christian) is the true one, hoping to trap him into an offense.
Melchizedek, a learned man, perceives the trap. He replies with a story: A rich man owned a precious ring, which he decreed would make the son who inherited it his heir and head of the family. This tradition continued for generations. Eventually, a father with three equally beloved and virtuous sons, each desiring the ring, had two identical rings made. On his deathbed, he secretly gave each son a ring. After his death, each son produced his ring, making it impossible to determine the true heir.
Melchizedek concludes that similarly, the three Laws were given by God, and each people believes its own to be the true one, but ""the question yet pendeth."" Saladin, realizing the Jew's wisdom, reveals his financial need. Melchizedek freely provides the required money, and Saladin repays him fully, gives him great gifts, and keeps him as a friend and advisor.

**Story 4: A Monk**
Dioneo tells of a young, lusty monk in Lunigiana. One day, he sees a beautiful country lass gathering herbs and, overcome by desire, brings her to his cell. While they are together, the abbot, passing by, hears them and listens at the door, realizing a woman is inside. The abbot returns to his chamber, planning to punish the monk. The monk, however, had seen the abbot spying. He quickly locks the girl in his cell, takes the key to the abbot, and asks leave to go to the wood for faggots. The abbot, eager to catch him, grants permission and takes the key.
Once the monk is gone, the abbot goes to the cell, opens it, and finds the weeping girl. Seeing her youth and beauty, the abbot's own desires are aroused. He decides to enjoy her himself, rationalizing that a hidden sin is half-forgiven. He comforts her, reveals his desire, and she, not being ""iron nor adamant,"" complies. The abbot then lies with her on the monk's bed.
The monk, hidden in the dormitory, had observed the abbot's actions. After the abbot is finished, he locks the girl in and returns to his chamber, planning to imprison the monk. He summons the monk and severely rebukes him. The monk replies that he is too new to the order to know that monks use women for mortification, but now that the abbot has shown him, he will never offend again, but ""still to do as I have seen you do."" The quick-witted abbot realizes the monk saw him. Ashamed, he pardons the monk and charges him to keep silent. They secretly release the girl, and it is believed she returned many times.

**Story 5: The Marchioness of Monferrato**
Fiammetta tells of the Marquis of Monferrato, a worthy knight, who is on a crusade. King Philippe le Borgne of France hears of the Marchioness's beauty and falls in love. He plans to travel to Genoa for the crusade via land to visit her in her husband's absence, hoping to fulfill his desire.
The Marchioness, discreet and wise, anticipates his intentions. She welcomes him honorably but instructs her cooks to prepare only various dishes of hens for the royal meal, despite the region's abundance of game. The King is pleased but eventually asks, ""Madam, are hens only born in these parts, without ever a cock?"" The Marchioness, understanding his veiled question, boldly replies, ""Nay, my lord; but women, albeit in apparel and dignities they may differ somewhat from others, are natheless all of the same fashion here as elsewhere.""
The King comprehends her meaning – that women are all alike in their nature, and she is not easily swayed. He realizes words are useless and force is impossible. He stifles his passion, dines without hope, and departs for Genoa, making amends for his unseemly visit with his prompt departure.

**Story 6: An Honest Man**
Emilia tells of a Minor Friar in Florence, an inquisitor who sought rich purses more than heretics. He accused a simple, wealthy man of saying he had wine ""Christ himself might drink thereof."" The inquisitor, a devotee of ""St. John Goldenbeard"" (money), threatened him with fire. The man, terrified, paid a large sum of money (St. John Goldenmouth's ointment) to the friar for mercy. The punishment was commuted to wearing a yellow cross on black. He was also enjoined to hear mass daily at Santa Croce and present himself to the inquisitor at dinner.
One morning, he heard the Gospel verse, ""For every one ye shall receive an hundred."" At dinner, the inquisitor asked about the mass. The man expressed pity for the friars, explaining that since they gave away superfluous broth daily, they would be drowned in a hundredfold return in the afterlife. The inquisitor, recognizing the jab at his gluttonous hypocrisy, was enraged but, having already received blame for his previous actions, merely dismissed the man, telling him not to return.

**Story 7: Bergamino**
Filostrato tells of Messer Cane della Scala, a magnificent nobleman in Verona. He planned a grand entertainment but suddenly cancelled it, dismissing all guests except Bergamino, a witty storyteller. Messer Cane decided not to reward Bergamino, nor dismiss him. Bergamino, running out of money and having pawned two of his three fine suits, was distressed. One day, seeing Messer Cane at dinner, he appeared with a rueful countenance. Messer Cane, to rally him, asked what ailed him.
Bergamino recounted a story: Primasso, a learned and famous grammarian, once poor in Paris, heard of the Abbot of Cluny's immense magnificence and open house. Primasso, desiring to see this, traveled to the Abbot's residence. Fearing he might get lost and find no food, he brought three cakes of bread. He arrived before dinner, observed the grand preparations, and was seated at a table. It was custom that no food or drink was served until the Abbot sat. The Abbot, seeing Primasso, a poorly dressed stranger, thought, ""See to whom I give my substance to eat!"" and delayed. Primasso, hungry, ate his first cake. The Abbot, informed, said, ""Let him eat of his own."" Primasso ate the second, then the third. The Abbot, pondering his uncharacteristic avarice, realized that this man, who made him feel such an emotion, must be significant. He inquired and learned it was Primasso, whom he knew by reputation. Ashamed, the Abbot honored Primasso, clothed him sumptuously, gave him money and a palfrey, and left it to him to stay or go. Primasso, pleased, returned to Paris.
Messer Cane, understanding the allegory, smiled and said, ""Bergamino, thou hast very aptly set forth to me thy wrongs and merit and my niggardliness... I will drive it away with that same stick which thou thyself hast shown me."" He paid Bergamino's host, clothed him, gave him money and a palfrey, and allowed him to stay or depart.

**Story 8: Guglielmo Borsiere**
Lauretta tells of Messer Ermino de' Grimaldi, a Genoese gentleman of immense wealth but extreme avarice, known as Messer Ermino Avarizia. He was so miserly he denied himself necessities. Guglielmo Borsiere, a worthy and well-spoken minstrel (not like the corrupt ones of today), visited Genoa. Hearing of Ermino's avarice, he wished to see him. Ermino, having some gentle breeding, received him amicably and showed him his fine new house. Ermino asked Guglielmo, ""Pray, Messer Guglielmo, you who have seen and heard many things, can you tell me of something that was never yet seen, which I may have depictured in the saloon of this my house?""
Guglielmo, hearing this preposterous question, replied, ""Sir, I doubt me I cannot undertake to tell you of aught that was never yet seen, except it were sneezings or the like; but, an it like you, I will tell you of somewhat which me thinketh you never yet beheld."" Ermino asked what it was. Guglielmo promptly replied, ""Cause Liberality to be here depictured.""
Ermino was struck with shame, which changed his disposition. He declared he would have Liberality depicted ""after such a fashion that neither you nor any other shall ever again have cause to tell me that I have never seen nor known it."" From that day, due to Guglielmo's words, he became the most liberal and courteous gentleman in Genoa.

**Story 9: The King of Cyprus**
Elisa tells of the first King of Cyprus, a mean-spirited and pusillanimous ruler. A gentlewoman from Gascony, returning from a pilgrimage to the Holy Sepulchre, was shamefully abused in Cyprus. Unable to get redress from the King, who endured countless affronts himself, she decided to rebuke his pusillanimity. She presented herself to him in tears, not seeking redress for her own wrong, but asking him to teach her how he suffered his own affronts, so she might learn to endure hers, which she would gladly bestow on him.
The King, who had been sluggish, awoke as if from sleep. He cruelly avenged the wrong done to the lady and from that day forward became a rigorous prosecutor of all who committed offenses against his crown.

**Story 10: Master Alberto of Bologna**
Pampinea, as queen, tells of Master Alberto, a famous Bolognese physician, nearly seventy, who fell passionately in love with Madam Malgherida de' Ghisolieri, a beautiful widow. He constantly passed by her house, causing her and other ladies to mock him for being in love at his age.
One holiday, the lady and her companions, seeing Master Alberto approach, decided to entertain and then rally him. They invited him into a courtyard, offered him wine and sweetmeats, and civilly asked how he, a man of his age and wit, could be enamored of her, courted by many young men. The physician, with a blithe countenance, replied that his love was no marvel, as old men, though lacking vigor, still appreciate beauty, and indeed, with more knowledge, value it better. Regarding his hope, he compared it to ladies who eat the leaves of a leek (which are naught) instead of the head (which is better). He suggested that perhaps she, too, might choose her lovers similarly, and he, the ""head,"" might be chosen over the ""leaves"" (young gallants).
The lady and her companions were abashed. She thanked him for his courteous chastisement and declared his love dear to her, offering herself as his ""creature"" (servant), saving only her honor. The physician thanked her and departed. Thus, the lady, intending to shame him, was herself discomfited.

**Day the First - Conclusion**
The sun began to decline. Pampinea, her governance ending, announced Filomena as the new queen and crowned her with the laurel wreath. Filomena, blushing, confirmed the existing servant duties and declared they would remain in the same place. She then proposed the theme for the next day: ""OF THOSE WHO AFTER BEING BAFFLED BY DIVERS CHANCES HAVE WON AT LAST TO A JOYFUL ISSUE BEYOND THEIR HOPE."" Dioneo, alone, requested the privilege to tell any story he liked, not bound by the theme, and offered to speak last. The queen granted his request. They then walked by a clear stream, bathed, and returned for supper. After supper, Lauretta led a dance, and Emilia sang a song about her self-love and contentment. The queen dismissed them to rest.

**Day the Second**
**Introduction**
The company arose with the dawn, enjoyed the gardens, wove garlands, and sang. After eating, dancing, and resting, they reassembled in the meadows. Filomena, as queen, bade Neifile begin the day's stories.

**Story 1: Martellino**
Neifile tells of Martellino, a Florentine who, with two companions (Stecchi and Marchese), entertained princes by impersonation. In Treviso, a poor German named Arrigo died, and bells rang miraculously, leading people to believe him a saint. His body was brought to the Cathedral, where people sought healing. Martellino, eager to see the spectacle, devised a plan: he would feign himself a cripple, and his companions would carry him to the saint for healing.
Martellino contorted his body to appear palsied. Marchese and Stecchi carried him, humbly asking for passage. They reached Arrigo's body, and Martellino was laid upon it. After a moment, he began to ""heal,"" first a finger, then a hand, then an arm, finally stretching out completely. The crowd erupted in praise of Saint Arrigo. A Florentine who knew Martellino recognized him and exposed the trick. The Trevisans, enraged, attacked Martellino, beating him severely.
To save him, Marchese ran to the Provost's officer, falsely accusing Martellino of cutting his purse with 100 gold florins. Sergeants rescued Martellino from the crowd and took him to the palace. Other citizens, seeing an opportunity, also accused him of theft. The crabbed judge, incensed, ordered him tortured on the strappado. Martellino, denying the thefts, challenged his accusers to state when and where, proving he had only just arrived in Treviso.
Marchese and Stecchi, realizing their mistake, sought help from Sandro Agolanti, a man of influence with the Prince. Sandro intervened, and Martellino was brought before the Prince. He recounted his story, begging to be released. The Prince laughed, gave each of the three a suit of clothes, and sent them home, safe and sound.

**Story 2: Rinaldo d'Asti**
Filostrato tells of Rinaldo d'Asti, a merchant returning from Bologna. Near Ferrara, he joined company with three highwaymen disguised as merchants. Rinaldo, a simple man, told them he always said a Pater and Ave for St. Julian's parents each morning to ensure good lodging. The highwaymen, knowing his custom, mocked him, saying their saints would ensure their good lodging.
Later, near Castel Guglielmo, the highwaymen robbed Rinaldo of his money, clothes, and horse, leaving him in his shirt and barefoot in the cold and snow. His servant fled to Castel Guglielmo. Rinaldo, unable to enter the closed town gates, sought shelter under a projecting house.
Inside this house lived a beautiful widow, mistress of the Marquis Azzo. The Marquis had planned to visit her that night, and a bath and supper were prepared, but he was called away. The lady, hearing Rinaldo's lamentations outside, sent her maid to investigate. The maid found Rinaldo freezing and reported his plight. The lady, taking pity, opened a secret door and brought him in. She bade him enter the warm bath. After bathing, she gave him her late husband's clothes, which fit him perfectly.
The lady, aroused by the Marquis's expected visit, found Rinaldo handsome and desired him. She confessed her desire, and Rinaldo, grateful and eager, reciprocated. They spent the night together, satisfying their desires. In the morning, she gave him money and clothes, showed him how to enter the town, and asked him to keep their secret.
Rinaldo entered the town and found his servant. Miraculously, the three highwaymen who robbed him were caught for another crime, and his horse, clothes, and money were restored, save for a pair of garters. Rinaldo, thanking God and St. Julian, returned home rich and safe.

**Story 3: Three Young Men**
Pampinea tells of Messer Tedaldo, a rich Florentine gentleman with three sons: Lamberto, Tedaldo, and Agolante. They squandered their inheritance on lavish living. When their wealth was gone, they sold their remaining estates and moved to London, where they became successful usurers. They returned to Florence, bought back their estates, and married. They sent their nephew, Alessandro, to manage their affairs in England.
The three brothers in Florence resumed their extravagant spending. War broke out in England, and Alessandro lost all his investments. The Florentine brothers lost their credit, were imprisoned for debt, and their families were left in misery. Alessandro, fearing for his life, decided to return to Italy.
Leaving Bruges, Alessandro encountered an abbot of white friars, accompanied by many monks and knights. He learned the abbot was a young gentleman, newly elected, traveling to Rome to get a dispensation for his youth. The abbot, seeing Alessandro's good looks and manners, was smitten. Alessandro, in turn, told him his story. The abbot, compassionate, invited Alessandro to accompany him to Tuscany.
One night, at a poorly furnished village inn, Alessandro arranged the abbot's lodging. The host, finding no other place, offered Alessandro a pallet in the abbot's room, on grain-sacks. The abbot, feigning sleep, overheard and, consumed by desire, called Alessandro to his bed. Alessandro, initially suspicious of unnatural love, was reassured when the abbot, removing a shirt, revealed herself to be a woman. She was the King of England's daughter, fleeing an unwanted marriage to an old Scottish king. She had fallen in love with Alessandro and desired him as her husband. Alessandro, seeing her noble company and beauty, agreed. They secretly married before a picture of Christ and spent the night together.
In Rome, the princess, with Alessandro and the two knights, confessed to the Pope, revealing her true identity and her marriage to Alessandro. The Pope, after appeasing the enraged knights, solemnized their marriage. They returned to Florence, where the princess freed Alessandro's uncles from prison by paying their debts and restored their estates. She and Alessandro, taking Agolante with them, went to Paris. The two knights reconciled the King of England with his daughter and son-in-law. Alessandro was made a knight and Earl of Cornwall, reconciling the King with his son. Agolante recovered his English debts and returned to Florence rich. Alessandro and his wife lived long and gloriously, with some claiming he later conquered Scotland and became its King.

**Story 4: Landolfo Ruffolo**
Lauretta tells of Landolfo Ruffolo, a rich man from Ravello on the Amalfi coast. Seeking to double his wealth, he bought a great ship and sailed to Cyprus with merchandise. He found the market glutted, lost most of his money, and was near ruin.
Determined to recover his losses, he sold his ship, bought a small vessel, and became a corsair, plundering Turkish ships. In a year, he not only recovered his losses but doubled his original wealth. Content, he decided to return home.
Near the Archipelago, a storm forced him into a small harbor. Two large Genoese carracks, also seeking shelter, recognized Landolfo as rich and, being rapacious, attacked and captured his ship, scuttling it after taking his goods. Landolfo was taken aboard one carrack, left with only a doublet.
The next day, another storm separated the carracks. Landolfo's carrack struck a shoal near Cephalonia and broke apart. Landolfo, clinging to a plank, drifted until daylight. He then saw a chest floating nearby. A sudden gust of wind pushed the chest against his plank, overturning it. He swam to the chest and lay on its lid.
He drifted for two days without food, but drinking seawater. On the third day, he reached the coast of Corfu, where a poor woman was cleaning pots. She saw him, initially mistaking him for a monster, but then recognized him. She pulled him ashore, chest and all, and took him to her hut. She revived him with warm water, wine, and confections, nursing him back to strength.
When he recovered, she returned his chest. Landolfo, not remembering it, was disappointed by its lightness. He opened it and found it full of precious stones. Realizing their great value, he praised God. Fearing more misfortune, he wrapped the gems in rags, gave the empty chest to the woman, and, thanking her, traveled to Brindisi and then Trani. There, he met townsmen who clothed him and sent him to Ravello. He sold his jewels, became twice as rich as before, sent money to the woman in Corfu and the men in Trani, and lived honorably without further trade.

**Story 5: Andreuccio of Perugia**
Fiammetta tells of Andreuccio di Pietro, a horse-courser from Perugia, who went to Naples with 500 gold florins to buy horses. He arrived on a Sunday evening and, being a naive countryman, foolishly displayed his purse in the market. A beautiful Sicilian courtesan noticed his money. An old woman with her, who knew Andreuccio's father, greeted him. The courtesan, learning Andreuccio's identity and lodging from the old woman, planned to rob him.
That evening, the courtesan sent her maid to Andreuccio's inn. The maid invited him to her mistress's house. Andreuccio, believing he was handsome enough to attract a noble lady, followed. He was led to a house in a disreputable street called Malpertugio. The courtesan, feigning to be his long-lost sister, daughter of his father Pietro by a noble Palermitan lady, embraced him tearfully and told a fabricated story of her life, her marriage to a Guelph gentleman, and their flight to Naples. Andreuccio, convinced, believed her.
She insisted he stay for supper. After supper, she kept him engaged in conversation until late. When he retired to her perfumed chamber, he stripped to his doublet and laid his hose and purse by the bed. Needing to relieve himself, he asked the boy where to go. The boy pointed to a door. Andreuccio opened it and stepped onto a loose plank, falling into a privy pit below.
The courtesan, alerted by the fall, quickly took his clothes and money and locked the door. Andreuccio, covered in filth, realized he was tricked. He climbed out and tried to re-enter, but the door was locked. He loudly demanded his clothes and money, but the maid (from a window) denied knowing him. A bully from inside threatened him. Neighbors advised him to leave to avoid being killed.
Andreuccio, despairing, wandered off, intending to wash in the sea. He met two men carrying iron tools, who, smelling him, asked what happened. He told them his story. They, recognizing the courtesan's house, warned him he was lucky to be alive, as she would have killed him. They offered him a share in their plan to rob the tomb of a recently buried archbishop, who had a valuable ruby. Andreuccio, desperate, agreed.
At the cathedral, they opened the heavy marble tomb. The two men forced Andreuccio to enter. Fearing they would abandon him, he quickly took the ruby from the archbishop's finger and put it on his own. He passed out the crozier, mitre, and gloves, claiming there was nothing else. The men, suspecting he was hiding the ring, pulled away the prop, trapping him inside.
Andreuccio, in despair, nearly fainted. He heard more people approaching. These new thieves opened the tomb, and a priest, volunteering to enter, put his legs in. Andreuccio grabbed his leg, scaring the priest, who shrieked and fled with his companions, leaving the tomb open. Andreuccio scrambled out and escaped.
He found his two comrades, who were coming to pull him out. He told them what happened, and they explained their flight from the watch. They then went to the tomb, found it open, and discovered the other thieves had fled. Andreuccio, with the ruby, returned to his inn and, on his host's advice, immediately left Naples for Perugia.

**Story 6: Madam Beritola**
Emilia tells of Madam Beritola Caracciola, wife of Arrighetto Capece, a Neapolitan gentleman in high favor with King Manfred of Sicily. When King Charles I defeated Manfred, Arrighetto was imprisoned. Beritola, pregnant and with her eight-year-old son Giusfredi, fled by boat to Lipari, where she gave birth to another son, Scacciato. She then sailed for Naples, but a storm drove her to the desert island of Ponza.
While she was ashore lamenting, a pirate galley seized her boat with her children and nurse. Beritola returned to find them gone. Despairing, she resolved to die but found solace in two kidlings born in a nearby cave, which she suckled. She lived like a wild creature for months, eating herbs and drinking water.
Later, Currado Malespina, a marquis returning from pilgrimage, landed on Ponza. His dogs chased the kids into Beritola's cave. Currado and his wife found Beritola, wild and haggard. She recounted her story. Currado, who knew Arrighetto, wept and offered to take her home or keep her. She refused to be known but agreed to go to Lunigiana with him, bringing her goats. She lived as a humble waiting-woman to Currado's wife, known as Cavriuola (wild she-goat).
Meanwhile, the pirates had taken the nurse and children to Genoa. The nurse, to protect the boys, changed Giusfredi's name to Giannotto di Procida and taught him to conceal his identity, hoping for a change in fortune. The boys grew up as slaves in Messer Guasparrino d'Oria's house.
Giannotto, at sixteen, left Genoa and became a soldier. He heard his father was alive but imprisoned by King Charles. He came to Lunigiana and served Currado Malespina. He and his mother often saw each other but did not recognize one another due to time and changes.
Currado's daughter, Spina, a young widow, returned home. She and Giannotto fell in love and became lovers. One day, they were discovered by Currado and his wife in a wood. Currado, enraged, imprisoned them, intending to kill them. His wife persuaded him to spare their lives, and they were held in harsh conditions.
A year later, King Pedro of Aragon, instigated by Messer Gian di Procida, rebelled against King Charles in Sicily. Giannotto, hearing this, lamented his imprisonment, revealing his true identity as Giusfredi, son of Arrighetto Capece, to his gaoler. The gaoler reported this to Currado. Currado, realizing Giannotto's noble birth, decided to marry him to Spina, thus removing the shame. He questioned Giannotto, confirming his identity. Giannotto, despite his imprisonment, spoke with dignity, reaffirming his love for Spina. Currado, impressed, embraced him and arranged their marriage.
Currado then informed his wife and Cavriuola (Beritola) of the marriage. Beritola, recognizing Giannotto's features, embraced him, overcome with emotion. They recounted their misfortunes. Currado sent messengers to Genoa for Scacciato and the nurse, and to Sicily for news of Arrighetto. Messer Guasparrino, hearing the story and confirming it, gave Scacciato (now a handsome youth) his eleven-year-old daughter in marriage. He brought them to Currado's castle.
Amidst great rejoicing, a messenger from Sicily arrived with news: Arrighetto Capece was alive. He had been freed during the Sicilian revolt and made a captain by King Pedro, regaining all his honors. He had sent a brigantine for his wife and sons. The family was reunited, and the two couples (Giusfredi/Spina and Scacciato/Guasparrino's daughter) celebrated magnificent nuptials. They all returned to Palermo, where they lived happily.

**Story 7: The Soldan's Daughter**
Pamfilo tells of Alatiel, the Soldan of Babylon's daughter, renowned for her beauty. She was promised in marriage to the King of Algarve. She embarked on a ship with an honorable company. A violent storm wrecked the ship near Majorca. The crew abandoned the ship in a shallop, which then sank, killing all on board. Alatiel and her women, left on the waterlogged ship, drifted to shore.
Pericone da Visalgo, a gentleman, found the stranded ship and took Alatiel and her treasures to his castle. He was captivated by her beauty and, unable to communicate with her, resolved to make her his wife or mistress. Alatiel, realizing she was among Christians, decided to keep her identity secret and preserve her chastity. Pericone, failing with blandishments, got her drunk at a feast. She undressed and went to bed, and he lay with her. She, never having known a man, found pleasure in him and thereafter willingly sought his company.
Pericone's brother, Marato, also desired Alatiel. He conspired with two Genoese shipmasters, killed Pericone in his sleep, and abducted Alatiel, taking her aboard their ship to Chiarenza. Alatiel mourned her fate, but Marato comforted her, and she became familiar with him. The two Genoese masters, also smitten by Alatiel, threw Marato overboard and then fought over her, killing one and severely wounding the other.
Alatiel arrived in Chiarenza with the wounded master. Her beauty reached the Prince of Morea, who desired her. The wounded man's kinsmen, to gain favor, sent her to the Prince. The Prince, impressed by her royal manners, treated her as his wife.
The Duke of Athens, the Prince's kinsman, heard of her beauty and visited. He too fell passionately in love. He conspired with a chamberlain, Ciuriaci, to abduct her. One night, he killed the Prince and Ciuriaci, throwing their bodies from a window into the sea. He then abducted Alatiel, taking her to a seaside estate near Athens, where he kept her secretly, as he had a wife.
The Prince's death was discovered, and the Duke was suspected. The new Prince (the dead Prince's brother) declared war on the Duke. The Emperor of Constantinople sent his son Constantine and nephew Manuel to aid the Duke. The Duchess of Athens, Constantine's sister, complained to them about the Duke's mistress. Constantine, seeing Alatiel, also fell in love. Feigning illness, he returned to Athens, leaving Manuel in command. He then persuaded his sister to help him abduct Alatiel, claiming it was to remove the Duke's affront to her.
Constantine abducted Alatiel and took her by ship to Chios. He lived with her there, but the Turkish King Osbech, hearing of Constantine's wanton life, attacked Chios, captured Alatiel, and took her to Smyrna. Osbech, delighted by her beauty, made her his wife.
The Emperor, enraged by his son's capture, allied with Bassano, King of Cappadocia, against Osbech. Osbech marched to battle, leaving Alatiel with his trusted servant, Antiochus. Antiochus, a man in years, fell in love with Alatiel and, speaking her language, became her lover. When they heard Osbech was killed in battle and Bassano was approaching, they fled to Rhodes with Osbech's treasures.
Antiochus fell ill and, on his deathbed, entrusted Alatiel and his possessions to a Cypriot merchant, his friend. The merchant, returning to Cyprus, took Alatiel with him, presenting her as his wife for protection. During the voyage, they became lovers.
In Baffa, Cyprus, Alatiel was seen by Antigonus, an old gentleman who had served her father in Alexandria. Alatiel recognized him and, hoping to regain her status, revealed her true identity as the Soldan's daughter, Alatiel, who was believed to have drowned. She recounted her entire journey and misfortunes, omitting the details of her various lovers. Antigonus, moved by pity, promised to restore her to her father.
Antigonus went to the King of Cyprus and, without revealing the full story, persuaded him to send Alatiel back to the Soldan under his care. The King of Cyprus, pleased, received Alatiel honorably and sent her back to her father. The Soldan was overjoyed. Alatiel, following Antigonus's instructions, fabricated a story of shipwreck, capture by two young men, rescue by four men on horseback, and refuge in a convent, where she learned their language and customs. She claimed to have been sent to Cyprus by a kind abbess and then found by Antigonus. Antigonus corroborated her story, emphasizing her chastity and virtue.
The Soldan, believing her, was overjoyed and rewarded Antigonus. He then sent Alatiel to the King of Algarve, who received her joyfully. Alatiel, who had been with eight men, was presented as a virgin and lived happily as his queen. Pamfilo concludes, ""Lips for kissing forfeit no favour; nay, they renew as the moon doth ever.""

**Story 8: The Count of Antwerp**
Elisa tells of Gautier, Count of Antwerp, a noble and discreet gentleman, left as vicar general of France by the King and his son, who were at war with the Germans. Gautier, handsome and well-mannered, was a widower with two children. The King's son's wife, young and lusty, fell in love with him. She confessed her passion to him, arguing that her wealth and leisure excused her, and his worth made him a suitable choice. Gautier, a loyal gentleman, rejected her advances, vowing he would rather die than dishonor his lord.
The lady, enraged, tore her clothes and cried out that Gautier was trying to rape her. Gautier, fearing the courtiers' envy, fled the palace, taking his children, Louis (9) and Violante (7), and escaping to Calais. He then went to England, where he lived in poverty, disguised, and changed his children's names to Perrot and Jeannette, warning them never to reveal their true identity.
Jeannette was taken in by a marshal's wife in London. Perrot was taken in by another marshal in Wales. Gautier himself became a horseboy for a knight in Ireland.
Jeannette grew up beautiful and virtuous. The marshal's son, Jamy Lamiens, fell in love with her. Believing her of low birth, he kept his love secret, which made him gravely ill. Physicians despaired. One doctor noticed his pulse quickened when Jeannette entered the room. He told Jamy's parents that Jeannette was the cause of his illness. Though reluctant to marry their son to a poor girl, they agreed to it to save his life. Jeannette, though modest, agreed to marry Jamy, insisting on her honor.
Perrot, in Wales, grew into a valiant man, excelling in arms. A pestilence killed his lord, his lady, and their only son, leaving only a daughter, whom Perrot married. The King of England, knowing Perrot's worth, made him his marshal.
Eighteen years after his flight, Gautier, now old and changed, returned to England to find his children. He found Perrot a great lord and Jeannette married to Jamy. He did not reveal himself. Jamy, pitying the old beggar, took him into his service as a horseboy. Jamy's father, still despising Jeannette's low birth, made disparaging remarks about her children, which Gautier overheard.
War broke out again between France and Germany. The King of England sent Perrot and Jamy to aid the King of France. Gautier, as a horseboy, accompanied them. The Queen of France, on her deathbed, confessed to the Archbishop of Rouen that she had falsely accused Gautier. The King, hearing this, proclaimed a reward for information about Gautier or his children.
Gautier, hearing the proclamation, revealed himself to Jamy and Perrot. Jamy, astonished and ashamed of his past insults, begged forgiveness. Gautier insisted Jamy claim the reward for revealing him and his children, and present him to the King in his horseboy's attire to shame the King. Jamy did so. The King, recognizing Gautier, embraced him tearfully and restored him to his former estate, making him greater than ever. Jamy received a magnificent reward. Jeannette and Perrot's wife joined them in Paris. Gautier, his honor restored, lived gloriously in Paris.

**Story 9: Bernabo of Genoa**
Filomena tells of Italian merchants in Paris discussing their wives. Most believed their wives were unfaithful in their absence. Only Bernabo Lomellini of Genoa boasted of his wife, Madam Ginevra, as the most accomplished, chaste, and honest woman in Italy, vowing she would never be unfaithful. Ambrogiuolo of Piacenza scoffed, arguing that all women are naturally unstable and can be swayed. He wagered 5,000 gold florins against Bernabo's 1,000 that he could corrupt Ginevra within three months and bring back proof. Bernabo accepted, with the condition he would not go to Genoa or write to his wife.
Ambrogiuolo went to Genoa and, after observing Ginevra's virtuous life, realized he couldn't seduce her. He bribed an old woman, a frequent visitor to Ginevra's house, to hide him in a chest in Ginevra's bedchamber. For two nights, he emerged from the chest while Ginevra slept, observing the room's details and taking a purse, night-rail, rings, and girdles. He also noted a mole under her left breast with red hairs. He then returned to Paris and presented the proofs to Bernabo and the other merchants. Bernabo recognized the items and the description of the mole, confirming his wife's ""unfaithfulness."" He paid Ambrogiuolo and, enraged, returned to Genoa.
Bernabo, without entering the city, sent a trusted servant to his wife, asking her to meet him at a country house. He secretly ordered the servant to kill her. The servant, in a lonely valley, revealed the order. Ginevra, swearing her innocence, begged him to spare her. She proposed he take her clothes, give her his doublet and hood, and tell Bernabo she was dead and devoured by wolves. The servant, pitying her, agreed. Ginevra, disguised as a sailor named Sicurano da Finale, eventually found service with a Catalan gentleman.
She sailed to Alexandria with the Catalan, who presented falcons to the Soldan. The Soldan, impressed by Sicurano, took him into his service. Sicurano gained the Soldan's favor. At a merchant fair in Acre, Sicurano saw a purse and girdle he recognized as his own among a Venetian merchant's goods. The merchant, Ambrogiuolo, laughing, explained he got them from Madam Ginevra, wife of Bernabo Lomellini, after winning a wager about her chastity. He also mentioned Bernabo had her killed.
Sicurano, realizing Ambrogiuolo was the cause of her misfortunes, feigned amusement and befriended him, bringing him to Alexandria. Sicurano then arranged for Bernabo to come to Alexandria. Before Bernabo arrived, Sicurano had Ambrogiuolo recount his story to the Soldan. Later, Sicurano arranged for both men to appear before the Soldan. Ambrogiuolo, under threat, confessed the truth of his deception.
Sicurano then revealed herself as Ginevra, tearing open her clothes to show the mole under her breast. The Soldan, astonished, praised Ginevra's virtue. Bernabo, recognizing her, begged forgiveness. Ginevra, despite his cruelty, pardoned him. The Soldan ordered Ambrogiuolo to be bound to a stake, smeared with honey, and left to die by insects. He gave Ginevra all Ambrogiuolo's possessions and other treasures. Bernabo and Ginevra returned to Genoa, rich and reconciled, where Ginevra was highly honored. Ambrogiuolo died a tormenting death.

**Story 10: Paganino of Monaco**
Dioneo tells of Messer Ricciardo di Chinzica, a judge in Pisa, who was more witty than strong. He married a young, beautiful, and lusty woman, Bartolomea. Ricciardo, however, was sexually inept and, to avoid his wife's desires, taught her a ""calendar"" of saints' days, fasts, and vigils on which carnal conversation was forbidden, effectively limiting their intimacy to maybe once a month.
One day, at his country estate, Ricciardo and Bartolomea went fishing in two boats. A famous corsair, Paganino da Mare, captured Bartolomea's boat and took her, in full view of Ricciardo. Paganino, finding her beautiful, decided to keep her. He comforted her with words, and that night, he comforted her with deeds, making her forget her husband and his ""calendar."" She began to live merrily with Paganino in Monaco.
Ricciardo learned where his wife was and, desperate to get her back, went to Monaco. He befriended Paganino, who feigned ignorance of his identity. Ricciardo eventually revealed his purpose, asking Paganino to return his wife for a ransom. Paganino agreed, on condition that if the lady recognized Ricciardo and wished to return, she could, and Ricciardo would pay what he wished. If not, she would stay with Paganino.
They went to Paganino's house. Bartolomea entered, dressed and composed, but greeted Ricciardo as a stranger. Ricciardo, astonished, tried to make her recognize him, reminding her of their marriage. She, laughing, denied ever seeing him. Ricciardo, thinking she feared Paganino, asked to speak with her alone. Paganino agreed, warning him not to kiss her against her will.
Alone, Ricciardo pleaded with her, reminding her of their past. Bartolomea laughed and revealed she knew him perfectly. She rebuked him for his neglect of her youthful desires, his ""calendar"" of holidays, and his lack of vigor. She praised Paganino, who knew no holidays in bed and ""swink[ed] day and night and thump[ed] our wool."" She declared she would stay with Paganino and enjoy her youth, advising Ricciardo to leave.
Ricciardo, distressed, realized his folly. He returned to Pisa, having accomplished nothing, and died of chagrin, muttering, ""The ill hole will have no holidays."" Paganino, hearing of Ricciardo's death, married Bartolomea, and they lived happily, never observing saints' days or fasts. Dioneo concludes that Bernabo's belief in his wife's chastity was foolish.

**Day the Second - Conclusion**
The company laughed heartily at Dioneo's story, agreeing Bernabo was an ass. Filomena, her reign ending, crowned Neifile as the new queen. Neifile, blushing, confirmed the existing arrangements. She announced that the next day, Friday, and Saturday would be days of rest and prayer, in reverence of the Lord's passion and for women's traditional head-washing. They would then move to a new location. The theme for Sunday would be ""OF SUCH AS HAVE, BY DINT OF DILIGENCE, ACQUIRED SOME MUCH DESIRED THING OR RECOVERED SOME LOST GOOD."" Dioneo's privilege remained. They enjoyed the evening with a walk, supper, and dancing, with Pampinea singing a joyful song about her perfect love.

**Day the Third**
**Introduction**
On Sunday morning, the company, led by Queen Neifile, traveled to a new, beautiful palace on a knoll, surrounded by a delightful garden. They admired its spacious rooms, cool wells, and especially the garden with its trellised alleys, roses, jasmine, orange and citron trees, and a central fountain. The garden also teemed with tame animals. After exploring, they dined by the fountain, then rested, some reading or playing games. After none, they reassembled by the fountain, and Filostrato was asked to begin the day's stories.

**Story 1: Masetto of Lamporecchio**
Filostrato tells of Masetto, a young, robust, and handsome countryman. He heard Nuto, a former gardener for a convent of young nuns, complain about the low pay and the nuns' constant demands. Nuto also mentioned the nuns were all young and ""possessed of the devil,"" making it hard to please them. Masetto, inferring the nuns' desires, resolved to become the new gardener. Knowing he was too young and handsome to be hired normally, he feigned dumbness.
He arrived at the convent, making signs for food and offering to cleave wood. The bailiff, impressed by his strength, kept him for odd jobs. The abbess, Madam Usimbalda, seeing him and hearing he was deaf and dumb, suggested hiring him as gardener, believing he posed no threat to the nuns. Masetto, hearing this (while feigning to sweep), was delighted.
As Masetto worked, the nuns, believing him dumb, openly mocked and teased him. Two young nuns, discussing their strict confinement and the pleasures of men (which they'd heard about), decided to test their desires with the mute gardener, believing he couldn't tell. They led him to a hut, where he, still feigning simplicity, satisfied them. The sport pleased them so much that they returned repeatedly. Other nuns, observing them, eventually joined in, until all eight nuns became Masetto's lovers.
Finally, the abbess herself, walking in the garden, found Masetto asleep, with his clothes disarranged, revealing his body. Overcome by desire, she took him to her chamber, keeping him there for several days, to the other nuns' discontent (who wondered why the gardener wasn't working). Masetto, unable to satisfy all nine women, decided to speak. One night, with the abbess, he revealed he was not dumb, but had suffered a malady, now cured. He complained that one man could not satisfy nine women, asking to be released or for a solution.
The abbess, astonished, realized her nuns were ""wiser"" than herself. She consulted with the nuns, who openly confessed their actions. To avoid scandal, they agreed to tell the local people that Masetto's speech had been miraculously restored through their prayers. They made him bailiff, dividing his labors to make them bearable. Masetto continued to father many children, discreetly, until the abbess's death. He then returned home rich and a father, without the expense of raising children.

**Story 2: A Horsekeeper**
Pampinea tells of Agilulf, King of the Lombards, and his discreet and virtuous wife, Theodolinda. A horsekeeper, though of low birth, was handsome and worthy. He fell passionately in love with the Queen. Knowing his love was unreasonable, he kept it secret but sought to die in a way that revealed his passion. He observed the King's secret visits to the Queen's chamber: the King would wrap himself in a mantle, carry a taper and a wand, strike the door twice, and be admitted by a sleepy chamberwoman.
The horsekeeper acquired a similar mantle, taper, and wand. After bathing to remove any odor, he hid in the saloon. When all were asleep, he lit his taper, wrapped himself, and struck the Queen's door twice. The chamberwoman admitted him, took the light, and he entered the bed. Feigning to be troubled (as the King sometimes was), he lay with the Queen several times without speaking. Then, fearing to stay too long, he arose, took his mantle and light, and returned to his bed.
Soon after, the King came to the Queen's chamber. She, thinking he had just left, greeted him, saying he had already taken pleasure of her beyond his wont and returned too soon. The King, realizing she had been deceived, wisely decided not to expose her or himself. He feigned indifference and left, but resolved to find the culprit.
He took a small lantern and went to the gallery where his household slept. He felt each man's breast, knowing the culprit's heart would still beat fast from exertion and fear. He found the horsekeeper, whose heart was racing. To mark him without revealing his knowledge, the King clipped a lock of the horsekeeper's long hair.
The horsekeeper, realizing he was marked, immediately arose, found shears, and clipped a similar lock of hair from all his fellow servants in the gallery. In the morning, the King summoned all his household. Seeing most of them with clipped hair, he realized the trick. Choosing not to cause a stir for a petty revenge, he simply said, ""Let him who did it do it no more and get you gone in peace."" Only the horsekeeper understood. He never revealed the matter during Agilulf's lifetime and never again risked such a venture.

**Story 3: A Lady and a Friar**
Filomena tells of a beautiful, witty, and high-spirited Florentine lady, unhappily married to a wool-monger. She resolved to find a worthier lover. She fell in love with a gentleman who frequented a dull but reputedly holy friar. She decided to use this friar as a go-between.
She went to confess to the friar. After confession, she complained about the gentleman (her intended lover), claiming he was pursuing her against her will, causing her annoyance and risking her honor. She asked the friar, as a friend of the gentleman, to rebuke him and make him desist. She also mentioned her husband's wealth and her own love for him, feigning great piety. She secretly gave the friar money for masses.
The friar, believing her, rebuked the gentleman, who was astonished, as he had never pursued her. But he, being quick-witted, understood the lady's device. He feigned shame and promised to desist. He then began to pass by her house frequently, to her delight.
Later, to further inflame him and show her love, she returned to the friar, weeping. She claimed the gentleman had not only continued his pursuit but had sent her a purse and a costly girdle, which she brought to the friar, asking him to return them and warn the gentleman to stop, or she would tell her husband and brothers. The friar, enraged, took the gifts and promised to ""warm his ears.""
The gentleman, summoned by the friar, feigned denial of sending gifts. The friar, showing him the purse and girdle, severely reprimanded him. The gentleman, now overjoyed by these ""proofs"" of the lady's love, promised to desist.
When her husband went to Genoa, the lady returned to the friar, weeping. She claimed the gentleman had tried to enter her chamber by climbing a tree in her garden that very morning. The friar, furious, promised to deal with him. He then summoned the gentleman and gave him a severe dressing-down. The gentleman, understanding the lady's signals, went to the garden that night. He found the window open, entered, and lay with his mistress. They laughed at the friar's simplicity and made arrangements for future rendezvous.

**Story 4: Dom Felice and Fra Puccio**
Pamfilo tells of Fra Puccio, a rich but ignorant man near San Pancrazio, who became a devout tertiary of St. Francis. His young, fresh, and plump wife, Mistress Isabetta, suffered from his piety and lack of marital attention. Dom Felice, a young, comely, and learned Conventual monk, became Fra Puccio's friend.
Dom Felice, seeing Isabetta's situation, desired her. He subtly aroused her interest, and she, though willing, could not find an opportunity to be with him due to Fra Puccio's constant presence. Dom Felice devised a plan. He told Fra Puccio there was a short path to sainthood, unknown to most clergy (who kept it secret to maintain their alms), which he would reveal if Puccio promised secrecy and adherence.
The penance involved confessing sins, fasting for forty days (abstaining from his wife), and standing upright, crucifix-fashion, in a place visible to the night sky from complines (9 pm) until matins (3 am), reciting prayers. This would purge past sins and make future venial sins easily forgiven. Fra Puccio, eager for sainthood, agreed and told his wife, who, understanding the implications, readily consented to his penance.
Dom Felice then began visiting Isabetta nightly, bringing food and drink, and sleeping with her until matins, when Fra Puccio returned to bed. One night, Fra Puccio felt the bed shake and called to his wife. She, ""astride of San Benedetto his beast,"" replied she was ""tossing"" due to fasting. Fra Puccio, in his simplicity, believed her. They moved their bed to another part of the house.
Fra Puccio continued his penance, while Isabetta enjoyed her nights with Dom Felice. She often joked that he had found them ""Paradise."" The lady, having been starved of affection by her husband, found great pleasure in the monk. She continued to discreetly meet him even after Fra Puccio's penance ended. Thus, Fra Puccio, seeking Paradise for himself, unwittingly sent the monk and his wife there.

**Story 5: Ricciardo il Zima**
Elisa tells of Messer Francesco Vergellesi, a rich but avaricious gentleman of Pistoia. He needed a fine palfrey for his provostship in Milan. Ricciardo, known as Il Zima, a rich but low-born young man, had long loved Messer Francesco's virtuous wife. Il Zima owned the finest palfrey in Tuscany. Messer Francesco, hearing Il Zima might give him the horse for his wife's love, asked to buy it.
Il Zima offered it as a gift, on condition he could speak with Messer Francesco's wife alone, but in his presence, so no one else could hear. Messer Francesco, thinking to outwit him, agreed. He told his wife to listen but not to reply.
Il Zima, seated with the lady, passionately declared his undying love for her, praising her beauty and virtue. He confessed his willingness to do anything for her, even die, and begged her for mercy. The lady, though moved, remained silent due to her husband's command. Il Zima, realizing the husband's trick, then began to answer himself, speaking *as if he were the lady*. He said she had long perceived his love, returned it, but had to protect her honor. He promised to satisfy his desires when Messer Francesco went to Milan, instructing him to look for two napkins at her garden window as a signal to come to the garden door at nightfall.
Il Zima then concluded, speaking as himself, thanking her for her gracious reply. The lady remained silent. Il Zima turned to the husband, who, laughing, asked if he had fulfilled his promise. Il Zima replied he had spoken to a ""marble statue."" Messer Francesco, pleased with his wife's perceived virtue, accepted the palfrey. Il Zima, however, lamented that he had ""bought the palfrey and not sold it.""
A few days later, Messer Francesco departed for Milan. The lady, remembering Il Zima's words and his love, and feeling her youth wasted by her absent husband, decided to seize the opportunity. She displayed two napkins at her garden window. Il Zima saw the signal, came at nightfall, found the garden door open, and met her. They went to her chamber and became lovers. This first encounter was not the last; they continued their affair many times, even after Messer Francesco's return.

**Story 6: Ricciardo Minutolo**
Fiammetta tells of Ricciardo Minutolo, a noble Neapolitan, who, despite having a fair wife, fell in love with Catella, the beautiful and virtuous wife of Filippello Fighinolfi. Catella was fiercely jealous of her husband. Ricciardo, unable to win her, was in despair.
He learned of Catella's jealousy and devised a plan. He feigned to give up his love for Catella and pursue another lady, publicly jousting and doing gallantries for her. This convinced everyone, including Catella, that he no longer loved her. Catella then treated him as a neighbor.
One day, at a seaside gathering, Ricciardo subtly hinted at an affair of Filippello's. Catella, consumed by jealousy, pressed him for details. Ricciardo, making her swear secrecy, claimed Filippello was pursuing his (Ricciardo's) wife. He said his wife, following his instructions, had agreed to meet Filippello at a bagnio (bathhouse) the next day at none (3 pm). Ricciardo suggested Catella go in his wife's place to shame Filippello.
Catella, believing him, agreed. The next morning, Ricciardo arranged with the bagnio keeper to prepare a dark room. Catella, filled with rage, went to the bagnio. The keeper, following Ricciardo's instructions, led her to the dark room where Ricciardo was waiting. Catella, with covered head, entered and locked herself in. Ricciardo embraced her, and she, thinking him Filippello, reciprocated without speaking, fearing he would recognize her voice. They lay together.
After a while, Catella, still thinking she was with Filippello, began to furiously berate him for his infidelity and neglect, revealing her identity and her love for him. She boasted of her beauty and virtue compared to Ricciardo's wife. Ricciardo, enjoying her words, embraced and kissed her more passionately.
Finally, Ricciardo revealed his identity. Catella, recognizing his voice, tried to escape and cry out, but he held her. He explained his deception, arguing that her honor would be ruined if she exposed him, and it would cause a deadly feud between him and her husband. He promised to be her devoted lover. Catella, though enraged, recognized the truth of his words. She made peace with him and, having discovered the greater pleasure of a lover's kisses, continued her affair with Ricciardo discreetly.

**Day the Third - Conclusion**
The company found Fiammetta's story admirable. The king, seeing the sun setting, excused himself for the sorrowful theme of the day and crowned Fiammetta as the new queen. Fiammetta, with golden hair and a face of lilies and roses, accepted the crown. She announced the theme for the next day: ""OF THAT WHICH HATH HAPPILY BETIDED LOVERS AFTER SUNDRY CRUEL AND MISFORTUNATE ADVENTURES."" All approved. After arranging supper, they enjoyed the garden. Filomena led a dance, and Filostrato sang a plaintive song about his unrequited love and betrayal. The king dismissed them to rest.

**Day the Fourth**
**Introduction**
The author begins with a defense against critics who find his work too pleasing to women, unseemly for his age, or frivolous. He argues that envy attacks even humble works. He confesses his delight in pleasing women and finds it natural, citing the hermitling who, upon seeing women, desired them above all else. He defends his age, stating that wise men of old also sought to please ladies. He compares Muses to women, as both inspire poetry. He dismisses critics who advise him to seek bread, saying poets have found more in fables than rich men in treasures. He asserts that his stories, like all things, can be used for good or ill, depending on the reader's disposition. He will continue, turning his back on critics, knowing that even dust can be carried aloft.
The sun rose, and Filostrato's company enjoyed the garden. After dinner and a nap, they reassembled by the fountain. Filostrato bade Fiammetta begin the day's stories, on the theme of unhappy loves.

**Story 1: Tancred and Ghismonda**
Fiammetta tells of Tancred, Lord of Salerno, a humane prince who, in his old age, had one daughter, Ghismonda, whom he loved tenderly. He delayed marrying her until she was past her prime. She married the Duke of Capua's son, was widowed, and returned to her father. Ghismonda, young and sprightly, and seeing her father reluctant to remarry her, secretly sought a lover. She chose Guiscardo, a humble but worthy serving-man in her father's court. They fell deeply in love.
Ghismonda, to arrange a meeting, wrote a letter and hid it in a hollow cane, which she playfully gave to Guiscardo. He found the letter, which instructed him to use a secret stair from her chamber to an abandoned grotto, then a tunnel leading outside. Guiscardo prepared a rope and, disguised, entered the grotto. Ghismonda, feigning sleep, dismissed her women, opened the door, and joined him. They spent the day in her chamber. Guiscardo returned to the grotto at night. They continued this for some time.
One day, Tancred, visiting Ghismonda's chamber while she was in the garden, fell asleep on a hassock by her bed, hidden by a curtain. Ghismonda, unaware, entered with Guiscardo. They lay together on the bed. Tancred awoke and witnessed their intimacy. He remained hidden, resolving to take secret revenge.
After the lovers departed, Tancred returned to his chamber, heartbroken. That night, he had Guiscardo seized as he left the tunnel and imprisoned. The next morning, Tancred confronted Ghismonda, weeping, expressing his sorrow and shame at her choice of a low-born lover. He said he had resolved Guiscardo's fate but was unsure what to do with her.
Ghismonda, realizing her secret was out and Guiscardo was captured, composed herself. Without pleading, she defended her love, arguing that her father's delay in remarrying her and Guiscardo's worth were the reasons. She asserted that all humans are born equal, and true nobility lies in virtue, not birth. She praised Guiscardo's qualities, which Tancred himself had commended. She challenged Tancred to inflict his cruelty on her, vowing that if he killed Guiscardo, she would follow.
Tancred, though recognizing her spirit, did not believe her fully resolved. He ordered Guiscardo to be strangled that night and his heart brought to him. The next morning, he sent Guiscardo's heart in a golden bowl to Ghismonda, with a message: ""Thy father sendeth thee this, to solace thee of the thing thou most lovest, even as thou hast solaced him of that which he loved most.""
Ghismonda, who had prepared a poison, received the bowl calmly. She recognized the heart, kissed it, and thanked her father for such a noble sepulchre. She then lamented over the heart, recalling her love and Guiscardo's fate. She poured the poisoned water over the heart, drank it all, and lay on her bed, pressing the heart to her breast, awaiting death. Her women, alarmed, sent for Tancred. He arrived too late. Ghismonda, in her dying moments, asked for her body to be buried with Guiscardo's. She died. Tancred, repenting his cruelty, buried their bodies in the same sepulchre, to the mourning of Salerno.

**Story 2: Fra Alberto**
Pampinea tells of Fra Alberto, a wicked man from Imola, who fled to Venice and became a Minor Friar, feigning extreme sanctity. He was a great preacher, confessor, and trustee of wills, secretly indulging in vices. He fell in love with Madam Lisetta da Ca Quirino, a vain and simple-minded young lady who boasted of her beauty.
Fra Alberto, seeing her folly, decided to exploit it. He visited her, claiming that the Angel Gabriel had appeared to him in a vision, chastising him for disparaging Lisetta's celestial beauty and threatening him with a beating if he didn't seek her forgiveness. He then claimed the Angel Gabriel was enamored of her and wished to visit her in human form, asking her to send word when and in what form.
Lisetta, delighted, believed him. She agreed to receive the Angel Gabriel, on condition he would not leave her for the Virgin Mary and that he would come in a form that wouldn't frighten her. Fra Alberto then suggested the Angel would take his body, sending his soul to Paradise while he was with her. Lisetta, eager for the ""consolation,"" agreed. She left her door open for him.
Fra Alberto, after fortifying himself with food, disguised himself as an angel and visited Lisetta. He lay with her, and she was greatly pleased. He told her stories of heaven. He continued these visits. Lisetta, in her foolishness, boasted to a gossip that the Angel Gabriel was her lover. The gossip spread the story throughout Venice. Lisetta's brothers-in-law, hearing this, decided to catch the ""angel.""
One night, Fra Alberto, warned of the gossip, went to Lisetta's house. As he undressed, her brothers-in-law arrived. He fled through a window, falling into the Grand Canal. He swam to the other side and sought refuge with a poor man, inventing a story. The man, pitying him, hid him in his bed and left.
The brothers-in-law, finding the ""angel's wings"" (his disguise) but no angel, were furious. The poor man, hearing the city's gossip about the angel's escape, realized Fra Alberto was the culprit. He extorted 50 ducats from the friar. He then disguised Fra Alberto as a wild man for a public festival, smearing him with honey and covering him with down. He led him to St. Mark's Square, where he unmasked him, revealing him as the ""Angel Gabriel."" Fra Alberto was recognized, publicly shamed, pelted with filth, and eventually taken by his brethren, dying in prison.

**Story 3: Three Young Men**
Lauretta tells of Narnald Cluada, a rich merchant in Marseilles, whose three daughters (Ninetta, Maddalena, and Bertella) were awaiting his return to be married. Ninetta was secretly in love with Restagnone, a poor gentleman. Two other young men, Folco and Ughetto, fell in love with Maddalena and Bertella, respectively.
Restagnone, seeing their love, proposed to Folco and Ughetto that they pool their wealth with his (making him a third share) and flee with the three sisters to a place where they could live happily. The young men, eager for their lovers, agreed. Ninetta persuaded her sisters, who were also eager. They stole a large sum of money and jewels from their father, met their lovers, and sailed to Crete. They bought estates near Candia and lived lavishly.
After some time, Restagnone grew weary of Ninetta and fell in love with a local damsel. Ninetta, consumed by jealousy, became enraged. She obtained a deadly poison from an old Greek woman and gave it to Restagnone, who died that night. His death was mourned, but the cause was unknown.
The old woman was later caught for another crime and confessed to making the poison for Ninetta. The Duke of Crete arrested Ninetta, who confessed. Folco and Ughetto tried to save her from being burned, but the Duke was resolute. Maddalena, whom the Duke had long courted, offered herself to him in exchange for Ninetta's life and secrecy. The Duke agreed.
That night, the Duke feigned to put Ninetta in a sack and sink her in the sea, but instead brought her to Maddalena. The next morning, he delivered Ninetta to her sister. Folco, released, soon discovered Ninetta's presence and, suspecting Maddalena's infidelity, forced her to confess the truth. Enraged, he killed Maddalena. Fearing the Duke's wrath, he fled with Ninetta, taking what little money he could, and sailed away. Their fate was unknown.
Maddalena's murder was discovered, and Ughetto was falsely accused. He and Bertella, fearing death, bribed their captors and fled to Rhodes, where they died in poverty.

**Story 4: Gerbino**
Elisa tells of King Guglielmo II of Sicily, whose grandson, Gerbino, was a valiant and courteous youth. Gerbino heard of the King of Tunis's daughter, renowned for her beauty and worth, and fell in love with her by hearsay. She, in turn, hearing of Gerbino's valor, fell in love with him. They exchanged messages and gifts through a messenger.
The King of Tunis, however, betrothed his daughter to the King of Granada. Gerbino, distraught, resolved to abduct her if she traveled by sea. The King of Tunis, suspecting Gerbino's intent, sought and received King Guglielmo's assurance of safe passage for his daughter.
The princess, knowing she was to sail for Granada, sent a message to Gerbino, challenging him to prove his valor and love. Gerbino, despite his grandfather's pledge, armed two galleys and sailed to Sardinia, awaiting her ship. When her ship appeared, becalmed, Gerbino exhorted his men, promising them all the riches if he could have the lady. They attacked.
The Saracens, showing King Guglielmo's glove as a sign of safe conduct, refused to surrender. Gerbino, seeing the princess on deck, replied that ""there were no falcons there at that present and consequently there needed no gloves."" They fought fiercely. Gerbino set fire to a small vessel and pushed it against the Saracen ship. The Saracens, seeing no escape, brought the princess on deck, butchered her before Gerbino's eyes, and cast her into the sea, saying, ""Take her; we give her to thee, such as we may and such as thine unfaith hath merited.""
Gerbino, enraged, boarded the burning ship, slew many Saracens, and then rescued the princess's body from the sea. He wept over her and buried her honorably on Ustica. He returned home, the woefullest man alive.
The King of Tunis complained to King Guglielmo, who, unable to deny his broken faith, ordered Gerbino's execution. Despite pleas from his barons, Guglielmo had Gerbino beheaded, choosing to remain without posterity rather than be a faithless king. Thus, both lovers died miserably without enjoying their love.

**Story 5: Lisabetta**
Filomena tells of three wealthy merchant brothers in Messina, originally from San Gimignano, and their beautiful, well-mannered sister, Lisabetta. Lisabetta fell in love with Lorenzo, a handsome Pisan youth who managed their affairs, and he with her. They became secret lovers.
One night, the eldest brother saw Lisabetta going to Lorenzo. He told his brothers, and they decided to silently eliminate Lorenzo to avoid dishonor. Feigning a pleasure trip, they took Lorenzo to a lonely place and murdered him, burying him secretly. They told Lisabetta they had sent him on business.
Lorenzo did not return. Lisabetta, grieving, repeatedly questioned her brothers. One day, one brother angrily told her to stop asking about Lorenzo. Lisabetta, sad and fearful, ceased questioning but continued to mourn. One night, Lorenzo appeared to her in a dream, pale and disheveled, revealing his murder by her brothers and the location of his burial.
Lisabetta, believing the dream, obtained leave to go outside the city. With her maid, she went to the spot, dug, and found Lorenzo's body, still intact. Unable to move the whole body, she cut off his head, wrapped it in a napkin, and took it home. She wept over the head, then placed it in a pot of basil, covering it with earth and planting basil over it. She watered it with her tears and rosewater, tending it lovingly. The basil grew fair and sweet, nourished by the decaying head.
Neighbors noticed Lisabetta's constant mourning over the pot. Her brothers, seeing her wasting away, took the pot from her. She grieved intensely for its loss. The brothers, curious, emptied the pot and found Lorenzo's head. Fearing scandal, they buried the head and secretly moved to Naples. Lisabetta, never ceasing to lament for her pot, died of grief. The story became known, and a song was made about her.

**Story 6: Andrevuola**
Pamfilo tells of Andrevuola, a beautiful young woman in Brescia, who fell in love with Gabriotto, a man of mean condition but pleasing appearance. With her maid's help, they became secret lovers and eventually married in secret.
One night, Andrevuola dreamt she was with Gabriotto in her garden when a dark, frightful thing emerged from his body, tore him from her embrace, and carried him underground. She awoke in grief and fear. Gabriotto, wishing to visit her that night, laughed at her dream, recounting his own dream of a black greyhound tearing out his heart. He dismissed dreams as folly.
They met in the garden. While embracing, Gabriotto suddenly cried, ""Alas, my soul, help me, for I die!"" and fell dead, suffocated by a burst imposthume near his heart. Andrevuola, distraught, called her maid. She resolved to kill herself but was persuaded to preserve her honor and bury Gabriotto. She decided to carry his body to his house and leave it at the door.
She dressed Gabriotto's body in silk and roses, placed her wedding ring on his finger, and, with her maid, carried him through the garden. They were intercepted by the Provost's officers. Andrevuola, recognizing them, declared her identity and her willingness to confess, but warned them not to touch the body.
At the palace, physicians confirmed Gabriotto died of natural causes. The Provost, desiring Andrevuola, offered to release her if she yielded to his pleasures. She refused. Her father, Messer Negro, arrived and, learning the truth, demanded his daughter's release. The Provost, to excuse his own attempted violence, praised Andrevuola's constancy and offered to marry her himself.
Andrevuola, weeping, confessed her secret marriage to her father, asking forgiveness. Messer Negro, a kind man, forgave her and ordered an honorable burial for Gabriotto. The body was laid out in the courtyard, mourned by many, and then carried to the sepulchre by noble citizens.
The Provost continued his suit, but Andrevuola, refusing to stay in the world, became a nun with her maid.

**Story 7: Simona**
Emilia tells of Simona, a beautiful but poor Florentine girl who spun wool for a living. She fell in love with Pasquino, a young man who brought her wool from his master. He, in turn, loved her. They became secret lovers.
One day, Pasquino invited Simona to a garden for a more private rendezvous. She went with her friend Lagina, meeting Pasquino and his friend Stramba. Lagina and Stramba paired off, while Simona and Pasquino went to a sage bush. Pasquino plucked a sage leaf and rubbed his teeth with it, saying it cleaned them well. He then suddenly lost sight, speech, and died, his face swelling and turning dark.
Simona, distraught, cried out. Stramba and Lagina ran to her. Stramba, seeing Pasquino's swollen body, accused Simona of poisoning him. Neighbors, hearing the commotion, also concluded she was guilty. Simona was taken to the Provost. The judge, finding no evidence of malice, decided to inspect the body and the scene.
At the garden, Simona recounted the events and, to demonstrate, rubbed a sage leaf against her teeth. She immediately suffered the same fate as Pasquino and died. The judge and bystanders were astonished. The sage bush was cut down, revealing a giant toad underneath, whose pestiferous breath had made the sage poisonous. Pasquino and Simona were buried together in the church of St. Paul.

**Story 8: Girolamo**
Neifile tells of Girolamo, son of a rich Florentine merchant, Lionardo Sighieri. Girolamo grew up with his neighbor Salvestra, a tailor's daughter, and they fell deeply in love. Girolamo's mother, fearing he would marry beneath him, persuaded his guardians to send him away to Paris for a year.
He was kept in Paris for two years. Upon his return, still deeply in love, he found Salvestra married to an honest tent-maker. Salvestra, however, seemed to have forgotten him. Girolamo, desperate, resolved to speak with her.
One evening, while Salvestra and her husband were out, Girolamo secretly entered their house and hid among tent cloths. When they returned and her husband slept, Girolamo approached Salvestra, calling her name softly. She, awake, recognized him and begged him to leave, reminding him she was married and desired peace with her husband.
Girolamo pleaded, recalling their past love, but she remained firm. Desiring to die, he asked only to lie beside her to warm himself, promising not to touch her. She, pitying him, agreed. He lay down, and, overwhelmed by his lost hope and her cruelty, he clenched his hands and died silently beside her.
Salvestra, finding him cold, realized he was dead. She woke her husband, fabricating a story about a stranger who had died beside her, asking his advice. He suggested carrying the body to its own house. Salvestra then made him touch Girolamo's body. He, confounded, lit a light, dressed the body, and carried it to Girolamo's door, leaving it there.
In the morning, Girolamo's death caused an outcry. Physicians found no wounds, concluding he died of grief. His body was taken to a church. Salvestra, now filled with pity and revived love, went to the church. She cast herself upon his body, and, overcome with grief, died. Her husband then revealed the full story. The two lovers, whom love could not unite in life, were buried together in one tomb.

**Story 9: Sir Guillaume de Roussillon**
The king tells of two noble Provençal knights, Sir Guillaume de Roussillon and Sir Guillaume de Guardestaing, who were close friends. Roussillon's wife was very beautiful, and Guardestaing fell in love with her. She returned his love, and they became secret lovers. Roussillon discovered their affair, and his great friendship turned to mortal hatred. He resolved to kill Guardestaing.
Roussillon invited Guardestaing to supper, ostensibly to discuss a tournament. Guardestaing, unsuspecting, came unarmed with two servants. Roussillon ambushed him, crying ""Traitor, thou art dead!"" and ran him through with a lance. Guardestaing died. Roussillon dismounted, tore out his heart, wrapped it in a lance pennon, and sent it to his cook, ordering him to prepare it as the daintiest dish.
At supper, Roussillon's wife, wondering why Guardestaing hadn't arrived, was told he would come tomorrow. The cook served the heart as a ragout. The lady, finding it delicious, ate it all. Roussillon then revealed she had eaten Guardestaing's heart, ""whom you, disloyal wife as you are, so loved.""
The lady, distraught, replied he had acted as a ""disloyal and base knight,"" stating that she, not Guardestaing, should have borne the penalty. She declared no other food would follow such noble meat. She then threw herself backward from a high window, dying instantly.
Roussillon, dismayed and fearing vengeance, fled. The next day, the bodies were found and, amidst great mourning, buried in the same sepulchre in her castle chapel.

**Story 10: A Physician's Wife**
Dioneo tells of Master Mazzeo della Montagna, an old, famous surgeon in Salerno, who married a fair young lady. He neglected her sexually, claiming it required long recovery. His wife, discontent, found a lover in Ruggieri da Jeroli, a noble but disreputable young man. She aided him with money, hoping to reform him.
The doctor had prepared a powerful sleeping draught for a patient, which would make him sleep for three days. He left it in his chamber. One evening, the doctor was called away to Malfi. His wife summoned Ruggieri. Ruggieri, thirsty, drank the draught, thinking it water, and fell into a deep sleep.
The lady found him unresponsive and, believing him dead, was distraught. Her maid suggested putting him in a chest outside a neighbor's house, making it look like he was murdered by enemies. The lady refused to wound him. They placed him in a chest near a carpenter's shop.
Two usurers, planning to steal the chest, carried it to their house. Ruggieri, later awakening, found himself in the chest. He accidentally overturned it, making a noise. The usurers' wives, awakened, cried ""Thieves!"" Neighbors and the usurers seized Ruggieri. He was taken before the governor, confessed to theft (to avoid worse), and was sentenced to hang.
The lady and her maid heard the news. The doctor returned, found his draught missing, and explained its purpose. The lady realized Ruggieri had drunk it. The maid, learning of the chest's theft from a conversation between the carpenter and the usurers, understood how Ruggieri came to be found.
The maid, to save Ruggieri, went to the doctor and confessed to bringing Ruggieri into the house and giving him the ""water,"" feigning it was for her own affair. The doctor, though angry, pardoned her. She then went to the prison and instructed Ruggieri what to say. She then went to the magistrate, offering herself to him to gain his ear. After he had his pleasure, she explained the full story: her affair, the draught, the chest, and the usurers' theft.
The magistrate, verifying the story with the doctor, carpenter, and usurers, released Ruggieri as innocent. The usurers were fined for theft. Ruggieri, delighted, returned home with his mistress, and they continued their affair.

**Day the Fourth - Conclusion**
Dioneo's story made the ladies laugh, recovering them from the melancholy of the previous tales. Filostrato, his reign ending, crowned Fiammetta as queen. Fiammetta, with her beautiful golden hair, accepted. She proposed the theme for the next day: ""OF THAT WHICH HATH HAPPILY BETIDED LOVERS AFTER SUNDRY CRUEL AND MISFORTUNATE ADVENTURES."" All approved. They supped and danced. Filostrato sang a mournful song about his betrayed love. The king dismissed them to rest.

**Day the Fifth**
**Introduction**
Fiammetta's company arose at dawn, enjoying the gardens and fields. After refreshments, dinner, and dancing, they reassembled by the fountain. Fiammetta, as queen, bade Pamfilo begin the stories of happily resolved loves.

**Story 1: Cimon**
Pamfilo tells of Aristippus, a noble and rich gentleman in Cyprus, whose son, Galesus, was a dullard and uncouth, nicknamed Cimon (brute beast). Aristippus sent Cimon to live in the country. One day, in May, Cimon found a beautiful damsel, Iphigenia, asleep by a spring in a coppice, lightly clad. He gazed at her, and a new thought awakened in his rude breast. He admired her features and longed to see her eyes. He refrained from waking her, believing her a goddess.
Iphigenia awoke, saw C known to all, and asked what he sought. He replied, ""I will begone with thee,"" and followed her home. Cimon then returned to his father, declaring he would no longer live in the country. Love for Iphigenia transformed Cimon. He dressed finely, learned manners, studied philosophy, became eloquent, and excelled in arms. Within four years, he was the most accomplished gentleman in Cyprus. Love had awakened his dormant virtues.
Cimon, now called Galesus again, sought Iphigenia's hand from her father, Cipseus, but she was promised to Pasimondas of Rhodes. When the wedding day approached, Cimon resolved to have her or die. He secretly equipped a ship and awaited Iphigenia's vessel. He intercepted it, boarded it alone, and fought fiercely, demanding Iphigenia. The Rhodians surrendered her. Cimon took her to his ship, comforting her, and released the Rhodians.
Cimon, overjoyed, decided to go to Crete, where he had kin. But a violent storm arose. Iphigenia cursed Cimon's love, believing the gods were punishing his presumption. The storm drove them to Rhodes, near the ship of the Rhodians Cimon had released. They were recognized, captured, and imprisoned. Iphigenia was taken in by noble ladies, awaiting her wedding.
Cimon and his men were spared death due to their previous clemency. Pasimondas, eager for his wedding, also arranged for his brother Ormisdas to marry Cassandra, whom Lysimachus (a Rhodian magistrate) loved. Lysimachus, distraught, resolved to abduct Cassandra. He sought Cimon's help, offering him Iphigenia in return. Cimon, his spirit rekindled, agreed.
On the wedding day, Lysimachus, Cimon, and their armed companions stormed Pasimondas's house, seized Iphigenia and Cassandra, and carried them to a waiting ship. Cimon killed Pasimondas and Ormisdas. They sailed to Crete, where they married their mistresses. After some exile, their friends reconciled them with their families. Cimon returned to Cyprus with Iphigenia, and Lysimachus to Rhodes with Cassandra, living long and happily.

**Story 2: Costanza**
Emilia tells of Costanza, a beautiful damsel from Lipari, who loved Martuccio Gomito, a worthy young man. Her father refused their marriage due to Martuccio's poverty. Martuccio, enraged, became a corsair, vowing to return rich. He plundered Turkish vessels and became wealthy but, seeking more, was captured by Saracens and imprisoned in Tunis.
News reached Lipari that Martuccio and his crew had drowned. Costanza, heartbroken, resolved to die. She secretly took a fishing boat, set sail, and committed herself to the sea, hoping to drown.
Instead, a light wind carried her to Susa in Barbary. A poor woman, Carapresa, found her and, taking pity, brought her to her hut. Costanza, despairing, learned she was in Barbary. Carapresa, a Trapanese woman, took Costanza to Susa and placed her with an old, kind Saracen lady, who worked with other women. Costanza learned their language and crafts.
Meanwhile, in Tunis, King Mariabdela faced war. Martuccio, in prison, offered the King counsel: use thinner bowstrings and arrows with narrow notches, so his archers could use enemy arrows, but the enemy couldn't use his. The King, a wise prince, followed this advice and won the war. Martuccio became his favorite and rose to great wealth.
News of Martuccio's success reached Costanza. Her love rekindled. She revealed her story to the old lady, who took her to Tunis. Carapresa confirmed Martuccio's status. The old lady told Martuccio that Costanza was there. Costanza, overjoyed, embraced him. Martuccio, astonished, embraced her back.
Martuccio told the King his story and asked leave to marry Costanza. The King, marveling, granted permission and bestowed magnificent gifts on them. Martuccio and Costanza, with Carapresa, returned to Lipari, where they were received with great joy. They married and lived long and happily.

**Story 3: Pietro Boccamazza**
Elisa tells of Pietro Boccamazza, a noble Roman youth, who loved Agnolella, a beautiful plebeian girl. His family opposed the match. Pietro, unable to marry her, persuaded Agnolella to flee with him to Anagni.
They rode out of Rome, but Pietro took a wrong turn into a wood. They were ambushed by twelve footmen. Agnolella, seeing them, spurred her horse into the wood. Pietro was captured. The footmen, mistaking him for an enemy of the Orsini, ordered him to strip and be hanged. Suddenly, twenty-five other footmen attacked. Pietro, seeing his chance, grabbed his clothes, mounted his horse, and fled into the wood, searching for Agnolella.
He wandered all day, calling her name, but found no trace. Fearing wild beasts, he tied his horse to an oak and climbed the tree to sleep. That night, wolves devoured his horse.
Agnolella, also lost, found a path leading to a small house. An old couple warned her of dangerous companies in the area. She stayed, hiding in a hay heap when a band of rogues arrived. They took her horse. The old couple, finding her, took her to a nearby castle belonging to Lionello di Campodifiore, whose wife, a kind lady, recognized Agnolella and Pietro (as a friend of her husband). Believing Pietro dead, she offered Agnolella refuge.
Pietro, freezing in the oak, saw a fire and found shepherds, who gave him food and warmth. They told him of Lionello's castle. Pietro went there and found Agnolella. They were overjoyed. The lady, though chiding Pietro for his rashness, agreed to marry them, seeing their love and miraculous escapes. She held a wedding for them. A few days later, they returned to Rome, where the lady reconciled Pietro with his family. They lived happily to a good old age.

**Story 4: Ricciardo Manardi**
Filostrato tells of Messer Lizio da Valbona, a gentleman in Romagna, who had a beautiful daughter, Caterina. Ricciardo Manardi, a handsome young man who frequented Messer Lizio's house, fell in love with Caterina, and she with him.
Caterina complained of the heat to her mother, suggesting she sleep in the gallery adjoining her father's garden, to hear the nightingale. Messer Lizio, initially reluctant, agreed. Caterina made a bed there and signaled Ricciardo. That night, Ricciardo climbed the wall and joined Caterina. They spent the night together, making the ""nightingale sing many a time.""
At daybreak, they fell asleep, naked and entwined, Caterina holding Ricciardo's private parts. Messer Lizio, checking on his daughter, found them. He recognized Ricciardo but, instead of anger, saw an opportunity. He called his wife, Madam Giacomina, who also witnessed the scene. Messer Lizio, deciding Ricciardo was a suitable husband, told his wife not to cry out, as Ricciardo was rich and noble.
Ricciardo awoke, terrified. Messer Lizio confronted him, offering him a choice: marry Caterina or die. Ricciardo, eager to escape death and possess his love, readily agreed. Messer Lizio, using his wife's ring, married them on the spot. After more lovemaking, they arose. A few days later, they had a formal wedding with their families and lived happily.

**Story 5: Giannole di Severino**
Neifile tells of Guidotto da Cremona and Giacomino da Pavia, two old Lombards in Fano. Guidotto, dying, left his ten-year-old daughter and wealth to Giacomino. Giacomino moved to Faenza, where the girl grew into a beautiful and virtuous damsel. Two young men, Giannole di Severino and Minghino di Mingole, fell deeply in love with her.
Both desired to marry her but were prevented by their families. They each sought to win her secretly. Giannole bribed Crivello, Giacomino's servant, to let him into the house when Giacomino was out. Minghino bribed the maidservant, who promised to signal him.
One evening, Giacomino went to supper. Crivello signaled Giannole, who entered with two companions, intending to abduct the girl. Simultaneously, the maid signaled Minghino, who arrived with his armed companions. A fight ensued. Minghino rescued the girl and returned her to Giacomino's house. Many were arrested, including Giannole, Minghino, and Crivello.
Giacomino, learning the girl was not at fault, decided to marry her quickly. The young men's kinsmen, fearing for the imprisoned youths, pleaded with Giacomino. He revealed that the girl was not from Cremona or Pavia but a Faentine, found by Guidotto during the city's capture by Emperor Frederick.
Guiglielmino da Medicina, who had been with Guidotto, confirmed the story and identified the plundered house as Bernabuccio's. Bernabuccio, present, remembered losing a two-year-old daughter during the sack. He found a cross-shaped scar over her left ear, confirming she was his daughter.
Bernabuccio was reunited with his daughter, Agnesa, with great joy. The town captain, learning Giannole was Agnesa's brother, released him, Minghino, and Crivello. He reconciled Giannole and Minghino. Agnesa was given to Minghino in marriage, and they lived happily.

**Story 6: Gianni di Procida**
Pampinea tells of Restituta, a beautiful girl from Ischia, daughter of Marino Bolgaro. Gianni, from the nearby island of Procida, loved her passionately, and she him. He often swam to Ischia to see her. One summer day, Restituta was gathering shellfish when Sicilian corsairs abducted her. They took her to Calabria, then, unable to agree on who should have her, presented her to King Frederick of Sicily, who was young and delighted in such things. She was lodged in a pavilion in his garden, La Cuba.
Gianni, hearing of her abduction, sailed along the coast, eventually learning she was in Palermo with the King. Despairing, he sent his pinnace away and stayed in Palermo. He saw her at a window, and she saw him. She instructed him how to enter the garden by climbing. That night, Gianni climbed into the garden, found a pole, and entered her chamber through an open window. Restituta, believing her honor already compromised, decided to yield to him and hoped he would take her away. They became lovers and fell asleep in each other's arms.
The King, feeling better, decided to visit Restituta. He entered her chamber and found her and Gianni naked in bed. Enraged, he decided to execute them publicly by fire. He ordered them bound and taken to Palermo's public square to be burned at tierce (9 am).
The lovers were bound to a stake. The townspeople gathered, admiring their beauty. Ruggieri dell' Oria, the King's admiral, recognized Gianni di Procida. Gianni confessed his identity and his love, begging to be turned to face Restituta as they died. Ruggieri, laughing, promised he would see her until he grew weary.
Ruggieri then confronted the King, arguing that the lovers' offense, though deserving punishment, should not come from him. He revealed Gianni was the nephew of Messer Gian di Procida, who had helped the King gain Sicily, and Restituta was the daughter of Marino Bolgaro, a powerful man in Ischia. He argued that their sin was one of love, not malice, and that the King should reward, not punish, such loyal families.
The King, realizing his error, pardoned them. He ordered them released, clothed them sumptuously, and married Gianni to Restituta. He gave them magnificent presents and sent them back to Ischia, where they were received with great joy and lived happily.

**Story 7: Teodoro**
Lauretta tells of Messer Amerigo Abate of Trapani, a gentleman who bought several boys from Genoese corsairs, believing them Turks. One, Teodoro, was of noble mien. Messer Amerigo freed him, baptized him Pietro, and made him chief of his affairs.
Messer Amerigo's daughter, Violante, a beautiful damsel, fell in love with Pietro, and he with her. They kept their love secret. One hot day, Violante, her mother, and Pietro went to a country estate. A sudden hailstorm forced them to take refuge in a ruined hut. Pietro and Violante, pressed close, confessed their love and became lovers. They continued to meet secretly.
Violante became pregnant. Pietro, fearing for his life, wanted to flee, but Violante convinced him to stay, promising to protect him. When her pregnancy could no longer be hidden, she confessed to her mother, inventing a false story to protect Pietro. Her mother sent her to a country house.
During her delivery, Messer Amerigo unexpectedly returned from hawking. Hearing her cries, he entered and discovered his daughter's condition. He forced her to reveal Pietro's identity. Enraged, he nearly killed her.
Messer Amerigo reported Pietro to Messer Currado, the king's captain. Pietro was tortured and confessed. He was sentenced to be flogged through the city and hanged. Messer Amerigo, still furious, sent a servant to Violante with poison and a dagger, ordering her to choose her death, or be burned alive. He also ordered the servant to kill the newborn child.
As Pietro was being flogged to the gallows, three Armenian ambassadors from their king, resting in Trapani, saw him. One, Fineo, recognized a birthmark on Pietro's chest, a vermeil spot like a rose. He realized Pietro was his son, Teodoro, abducted fifteen years prior. Fineo called out, and Pietro responded in Armenian, confirming his identity.
Fineo, weeping, embraced his son and covered him with his mantle. He asked the officer to delay the execution. Fineo then went to Messer Currado, revealing Pietro's true identity and offering to marry him to Violante. Currado, ashamed of the injustice, released Pietro. Messer Amerigo, hearing this, regretted his actions and agreed to the marriage.
Violante, expecting death, was overjoyed to hear the news. She agreed to marry Teodoro. They were married with great magnificence. Fineo, delighted, celebrated their nuptials and took them, with their child, to Lazistan, where they lived happily.

**Story 8: Nastagio degli Onesti**
Filomena tells of Nastagio degli Onesti, a rich young man in Ravenna, who loved a noble but cruel and disdainful lady of the Traversari family. His love and lavish spending were unrequited. His friends advised him to leave Ravenna to abate his passion and expenditure. He agreed and moved to Chiassi, three miles away, where he lived magnificently.
One May day, lost in melancholy thought in a pine-wood, he heard a terrible wailing. He saw a beautiful naked damsel, torn by briers, fleeing two fierce mastiffs. Behind them rode a knight in dark armor, threatening her with a sword. Nastagio, filled with pity, tried to intervene.
The knight, identifying himself as Messer Guido degli Anastagi, revealed he had loved this woman, who was cruel to him, and he had killed himself in despair. She, rejoicing in his death, also died. For her cruelty and his suicide, they were both condemned to hell. Their penance was for her to flee and for him to pursue, kill her, tear out her heart and entrails, and feed them to the dogs. This was repeated every Friday in that spot, and in other places on other days. He warned Nastagio not to interfere with God's justice.
Nastagio, terrified, witnessed the knight kill the damsel, tear out her heart, and feed it to the dogs. The damsel then rose again and fled, the chase resuming. Nastagio, realizing this happened every Friday, devised a plan. He invited his cruel mistress, her family, and other ladies to a magnificent dinner in that same pine-wood the following Friday, setting the tables where the slaughter occurred.
During dinner, the ghostly chase appeared. The ladies were horrified. The knight's story was recounted. Nastagio's mistress, seeing and hearing everything, realized the fate that awaited her for her cruelty. Terrified, she immediately sent a maid to Nastagio, offering her love. He agreed to marry her. She told her parents, who were overjoyed. Nastagio married her, and they lived happily. This fright also made all the other ladies of Ravenna more amenable to men's desires.

**Story 9: Federigo degli Alberighi**
The queen tells of Federigo degli Alberighi, a noble Florentine, renowned for arms and courtesy. He fell in love with Madam Giovanna, a virtuous and beautiful lady, and squandered his wealth on jousts, entertainments, and gifts to win her love, but she remained indifferent. He became poor, with only a small farm and a magnificent falcon left. He moved to his farm in Campi, living meagrely.
Madam Giovanna's husband fell ill and died, leaving his son as heir, with Giovanna as his successor if the son died without issue. Giovanna moved to a country estate near Federigo's. Her son befriended Federigo and became fascinated by his falcon, longing to possess it. The boy fell ill, and his mother, desperate, asked him what he desired. He replied he would recover if he had Federigo's falcon.
Giovanna was torn. She knew Federigo's love for her and that the falcon was his last possession. She decided to go herself to ask for it. She visited Federigo's humble house, bringing a companion. Federigo, overjoyed and astonished, received her. Ashamed of his poverty, he realized he had nothing worthy to offer her for dinner. He killed his beloved falcon, plucked and roasted it, and served it to her.
After dinner, Giovanna revealed her purpose, explaining her son's illness and his desire for the falcon. She begged Federigo, not by his love for her, but by his nobility, to give her the bird. Federigo, weeping, confessed he could not, as he had already served her the falcon for dinner, deeming it the most worthy dish for her. He showed her the feathers, feet, and beak.
Giovanna first blamed him for killing such a falcon for a woman, then greatly admired his magnanimity. She returned to her son, who, whether from grief or his illness's natural course, died a few days later.
Giovanna, now very rich, was urged by her brothers to remarry. She declared she would marry no one but Federigo degli Alberighi, saying she preferred ""a man that lacketh of riches than riches that lack of a man."" Her brothers, recognizing Federigo's worth, consented. Federigo married Giovanna, became a better manager of his wealth, and lived happily with her.

**Story 10: Pietro di Vinciolo**
Dioneo tells of Pietro di Vinciolo, a rich man in Perugia, who married a lusty young woman, more to hide his own sexual preferences than for desire of her. His wife, Mistress Egano, discovered his indifference and his preference for other men. She resolved to seek her own pleasures, reasoning that she was young and women were made for this, and that her husband's example justified her actions.
She befriended an old, seemingly pious woman, who encouraged her to seize the joys of youth. The old woman became her procuress, arranging secret meetings with young men. One evening, Pietro was to sup with a friend, Ercolano. His wife arranged for a handsome youth to sup with her. Pietro unexpectedly returned. She quickly hid her lover under a hen-coop in a shed.
She opened the door, feigning anger at his early return. Pietro explained that it was a holiday (San Galeone's Feast) and he had sold an old vat in their house for five florins to a man waiting outside. His wife, quick-witted, declared she had already sold the vat for seven florins to a man who was inside checking its soundness. Pietro, pleased, sent away the first buyer.
Her lover, Giannello, emerged from the vat, feigning ignorance of Pietro's return. He complained the vat was dirty. Pietro, eager to complete the sale, agreed to clean it. While Pietro was inside the vat, scraping, his wife, with her head and arm in the vat's mouth, directed him. Giannello, seeing the opportunity, lay with her, satisfying his desire.
After Pietro emerged, Giannello declared the vat clean, paid the seven florins, and had it carried away. Dioneo concludes, ""Whoso doth it to you, do you it to him.""

**Day the Fifth - Conclusion**
Dioneo's story made the ladies laugh. Lauretta, her reign ending, crowned Emilia as queen. Emilia, blushing, accepted. She declared that for the next day, they would have no fixed theme, allowing everyone to discourse as they pleased, to provide rest and variety. All approved. They enjoyed the garden, and the ladies visited the ""Ladies' Valley,"" a beautiful, secluded spot with a lakelet. They bathed naked in the lake. The young men, hearing of the valley, visited it after supper. They all returned to the palace, where Pamfilo sang a song about his hidden love and joy. The king dismissed them to rest.

**Day the Sixth**
**Introduction**
The company arose at dawn, walked in the dewy fields, discussing stories and laughing. They returned to the palace for breakfast. After singing, some rested, others played games. When they reassembled, a clamor was heard from the kitchen. The seneschal reported a quarrel between Licisca and Tindaro.
The queen summoned them. Licisca, an older, fiery woman, insisted on speaking first. She complained that Tindaro, a young man, claimed Sicofante's wife (a neighbor) was deflowered by force on her wedding night. Licisca asserted it was done ""in peace and to the great contentment of those within."" She declared that no woman she knew went a maid to her husband and that wives played many tricks on their husbands. Dioneo, laughing, immediately sided with Licisca, calling Tindaro an ass. Licisca, triumphant, continued to boast until the queen angrily silenced them and sent them away. The queen then bade Filomena begin the day's stories, on the theme of witty replies.

**Story 1: Madam Oretta**
Filomena tells of Madam Oretta, a noble, well-bred, and witty Florentine lady, wife of Messer Geri Spina. One day, while walking in the country with a company of ladies and gentlemen, one gentleman offered to ""carry her a-horseback great part of the way we have to go with one of the finest stories in the world."" Madam Oretta gladly accepted.
The gentleman began a good story but told it so poorly, repeating words, correcting himself, and confusing names, that he marred it cruelly. Madam Oretta, feeling sick from his tedious narration, finally interrupted him pleasantly, ""Sir, this horse of yours hath too hard a trot; wherefore I pray you be pleased to set me down."" The gentleman, understanding the jest, laughed, changed the subject, and left the story unfinished.

**Story 2: Cisti the Baker**
Pampinea tells of Cisti, a baker in Florence, a man of humble condition but rich and with a lofty spirit. He had the best wines. Messer Geri Spina and papal ambassadors passed his bakehouse daily. Cisti, wishing to offer them his wine but not daring to invite them directly, would sit outside his door, drinking his wine with such relish that it made others thirsty.
Messer Geri, after two days, asked, ""How now, Cisti? Is it good?"" Cisti replied, ""Ay is it, Sir; but how good I cannot give you to understand, except you taste thereof."" Messer Geri and the ambassadors accepted. Cisti, refusing to let servants pour, personally served them, washing four new beakers. They found the wine excellent and drank there almost every morning.
Later, Messer Geri held a banquet and invited Cisti, who declined. Messer Geri sent a servant for a flask of Cisti's wine. The servant, spiteful, brought a large flagon. Cisti, seeing it, said, ""My son, Messer Geri sent thee not to me."" The servant returned, and Messer Geri, realizing the servant's intent, gave him a smaller, appropriate flask. Cisti then cheerfully filled it. That same day, Cisti sent a small cask of the wine to Messer Geri, explaining that it was not ""household wine"" (for servants) and he would no longer be his steward. Messer Geri greatly valued the gift and Cisti's worth.

**Story 3: Madam Nonna de' Pulci**
Lauretta tells of Messer Antonio d'Orso, Bishop of Florence. A Catalan marshal, Messer Dego della Ratta, desired a beautiful Florentine lady, the Bishop's grandniece. Knowing her husband was miserly, he bribed the husband with 500 gilded silver coins to lie with his wife. The affair became public, shaming the husband. The Bishop, though discreet, affected ignorance.
One St. John's Day, the Bishop and the marshal rode together, viewing ladies. The Bishop pointed out Madam Nonna de' Pulci, a fresh, fair, well-spoken, and high-spirited young woman, recently married. He playfully asked her, ""Nonna, how deemest thou of this gallant? Thinkest thou thou couldst make a conquest of him?""
Nonna, feeling her honor slighted, retorted, ""Maybe, sir, he would not make a conquest of me; but, in any case, I should want good money."" Both the marshal (who had bribed the grandniece's husband) and the bishop (whose kinswoman was shamed) were stung by her witty reply. They rode off, shamefast and silent.

**Story 4: Chichibio**
Neifile tells of Currado Gianfigliazzi, a noble, liberal Florentine who enjoyed hawking. One day, he caught a fat young crane and sent it to his Venetian cook, Chichibio, to roast. Chichibio, enamored of a neighbor's wench, Brunetta, gave her one of the crane's thighs when she demanded it.
At supper, Currado found the crane missing a thigh and asked Chichibio. Chichibio, without hesitation, replied, ""Sir, cranes have but one thigh and one leg."" Currado, enraged, threatened him, but Chichibio insisted he could prove it by showing him a live crane with one leg. Currado, to settle the matter, agreed to see the proof the next morning, threatening severe punishment if Chichibio lied.
The next morning, Currado took Chichibio to a watercourse where cranes gathered. Chichibio, terrified, spotted a dozen cranes standing on one leg, as they do when sleeping. He pointed them out to Currado. Currado cried ""Ho! Ho!"" and the cranes put down their other legs and flew off. Currado asked, ""How sayst thou now... Deemest thou they have two legs?"" Chichibio, quick-witted, replied, ""Ay, sir; but you did not cry, 'Ho! Ho!' to yesternight's crane; had you cried thus, it would have put out the other thigh and the other leg, even as did those yonder."" This reply amused Currado so much that his anger turned to laughter, and he pardoned Chichibio.

**Story 5: Messer Forese da Rabatta and Master Giotto**
Pamfilo tells of Messer Forese da Rabatta, a learned but small and misshapen lawyer, and Master Giotto, the greatest painter, who was also not handsome. Both had country houses in Mugello. One summer day, returning to Florence, they were caught in a sudden shower. They took shelter, and then borrowed two old homespun cloaks and rusty hats from a husbandman, continuing their journey drenched and muddy.
As they rode, Messer Forese, looking at Giotto's ill-equipped and scurvy appearance, laughed and asked, ""How sayst thou, Giotto? An there encountered us here a stranger who had never seen thee, thinkest thou he would believe thee to be, as thou art, the finest painter in the world?"" Giotto promptly retorted, ""Ay, sir, methinketh he might e'en believe it whenas, looking upon you, he should believe that you knew your A B C."" Messer Forese, realizing his own equally poor appearance, was silenced.

**Story 6: Michele Scalza**
Fiammetta tells of Michele Scalza, a merry and agreeable young Florentine. One day, discussing the oldest and best gentlemen of Florence, with various families being named, Scalza laughed and declared, ""The best gentlemen and the oldest, not only of Florence, but of all the world or the Maremma, are the Cadgers [beggars],... I speak of the Cadgers your neighbors of Santa Maria Maggiore.""
The others mocked him. Scalza wagered a supper for six that he could prove it. Neri Mannini accepted. Piero di Fiorentino was chosen as judge. Scalza argued that the older men are, the nobler they are. He claimed God made the Cadgers when he was ""learning to draw,"" while others were made after he knew how. As proof, he pointed to their misshapen faces: long, broad, crooked noses, jutting chins, uneven eyes, like children's first drawings. He concluded they were the most ancient and therefore the noblest. Piero, Neri, and all present laughed and agreed Scalza had won the supper.

**Story 7: Madam Filippa**
Filostrato tells of Madam Filippa, a noble and beautiful lady in Prato, who was found by her husband, Rinaldo de' Pugliesi, in bed with her lover, Lazzerino de' Guazzagliotri. Prato had a cruel statute: any woman caught in adultery by her husband was to be burned. Rinaldo, enraged, accused his wife before the provost.
Madam Filippa, advised by friends to deny the charge, resolved to appear and confess the truth with an undaunted spirit. Before the provost and a large crowd, she firmly admitted her affair with Lazzerino. She then argued that laws should be common to all and made with consent. This statute, she said, applied only to women, who could satisfy many men, and was made without women's consent, thus being unjust. She asked the provost to question her husband if she had ever denied him his pleasures.
Rinaldo confessed she had always granted him his every pleasure. Madam Filippa then asked, ""If he have still taken of me that which was needful and pleasing to him, what, I ask you, was or am I to do with that which remaineth over and above his requirements? Should I cast it to the dogs? Was it not far better to gratify withal a gentleman who loveth me more than himself, than to leave it waste or spoil?""
The crowd, after much laughter, cried out that she was right. At the provost's instance, they modified the statute to apply only to women who sold their favors for money. Rinaldo departed, shamed. Madam Filippa returned home triumphant.

**Story 8: Fresco**
Emilia tells of Fresco da Celatico and his niece, Ciesca, a vain, proud, and humorless woman who constantly criticized others' appearances. One holiday, she returned home early, complaining that there were too many ""disagreeable and tiresome people"" in the city, whom she hated to see. Fresco, displeased with her airs, replied, ""My lass, if disagreeable folk be so distasteful to thee as thou sayest, never mirror thyself in the glass, so thou wouldst live merry."" Ciesca, empty-headed, did not understand his meaning and insisted she would mirror herself like other women.

**Story 9: Guido Cavalcanti**
The queen tells of Guido Cavalcanti, a Florentine gentleman, one of the best logicians and natural philosophers. He was often engrossed in abstract thought, leading common folk to believe he sought to prove God's non-existence. Messer Betto Brunelleschi and his company often tried to draw Guido into their social circle.
One day, Guido was walking near San Giovanni, where many marble tombs stood. Messer Betto and his company, on horseback, espied him and decided to ""plague him."" They charged down and asked, ""Guido, thou refusest to be of our company; but, harkye, whenas thou shalt have found that God is not, what wilt thou have accomplished?""
Guido, seeing himself surrounded, replied promptly, ""Gentlemen, you may say what you will to me in your own house."" He then sprang onto one of the tombs and, leaping to the other side, escaped. The gentlemen were confused, thinking his reply meant nothing. But Messer Betto explained: ""these tombs are the houses of the dead... and these, saith he, are our house, meaning thus to show us that we and other foolish and unlettered men are, compared with him and other men of learning, worse than dead folk; wherefore, being here, we are in our own house."" They understood and never bothered Guido again, recognizing Messer Betto's subtle wit.

**Story 10: Fra Cipolla**
Dioneo tells of Fra Cipolla, a friar of St. Anthony, who visited Certaldo annually to collect alms. He was a jolly, red-haired, witty man, though unlearned. One Sunday, he announced he would show a holy relic: ""one of the Angel Gabriel's feathers, which remained in the Virgin Mary's chamber, whenas he came to announce to her in Nazareth.""
Two roguish young men, Giovanni del Bragioniera and Biagio Pizzini, friends of Fra Cipolla, decided to play a trick. While the friar dined, they went to his inn. Biagio distracted his servant, Guccio Balena (a lazy, gluttonous, womanizing knave), while Giovanni searched the friar's saddle-bags. They found a parrot's tail-feather, which they correctly assumed was the ""relic."" They replaced it with some coals and returned everything as they found it.
After none, a large crowd gathered to see the feather. Fra Cipolla, unaware of the trick, began his sermon. He solemnly recited the Confiteor, lit candles, and opened the casket. Seeing coals, he quickly adapted. He praised God, then explained that while seeking the ""Privileges of Porcellana"" in the East, he had visited many fantastical lands (Borgo de' Greci, Algarve, Baldacca, Parione, Sardinia, Truffia, Buffia, Menzogna, Abruzzi, Mountains of the Bachi, India Pastinaca). There, he met the Patriarch of Jerusalem, who showed him many relics (finger of the Holy Ghost, seraph's forelock, Cherubim's nail, Verbum Caro's rib, Holy Catholic Faith's vestments, rays of the star of the Wise Men, St. Michael's sweat, St. Lazarus's jawbone). In exchange for some ""Steeps of Monte Morello"" and ""chapters of the Caprezio,"" the Patriarch gave him a tooth of the Holy Rood, the sound of Solomon's Temple bells in a vial, the Angel Gabriel's feather, and the coals that roasted St. Lawrence.
He claimed he carried the feather in one casket and the coals in another, and they were so alike he had accidentally brought the coals. He declared it God's will, as St. Lawrence's feast was approaching, to rekindle their devotion by showing them the blessed coals. He then offered to mark them with the coals, promising protection from fire. The simple folk, believing him, offered more alms to be touched. Fra Cipolla made many crosses on their clothes.
The two young men, present at the sermon, laughed so hard they thought their jaws would crack. They later confessed their prank to Fra Cipolla and returned his feather.

**Day the Sixth - Conclusion**
The company laughed heartily at Fra Cipolla's story. Lauretta, her reign ending, crowned Dioneo as king, challenging him to govern the ladies well. Dioneo accepted, promising to provide enjoyment. He announced the theme for the next day, inspired by Licisca's earlier remarks: ""OF THE TRICKS WHICH, OR FOR LOVE OR FOR THEIR OWN PRESERVATION, WOMEN HAVE HERETOFORE PLAYED THEIR HUSBANDS, WITH OR WITHOUT THE LATTER'S COGNIZANCE THEREOF."" Some ladies objected, finding the theme unseemly, but Dioneo argued that in these times of plague, all liberty of discourse was permitted, especially among their virtuous company, and that such stories could be useful. The ladies agreed.
The sun was still high. The ladies visited the ""Ladies' Valley"" again, bathing naked in the lake. The young men later visited the valley. After supper, Pamfilo sang a song about his love, which was understood to be for Fiammetta. The king dismissed them to rest.

**Day the Seventh**
**Introduction**
At dawn, the seneschal went to the Ladies' Valley to prepare for the day. The company followed, enjoying the birdsong. They re-examined the beautiful valley, then broke their fast. They sang, then rested in curtained beds. After none, they reassembled by the lake. The king bade Emilia begin the day's stories.

**Story 1: Gianni Lotteringhi**
Emilia tells of Gianni Lotteringhi, a simple-minded wool-comber in Florence, who was often a leader of Laudsingers and devoted to religious practices. His discreet and beautiful wife, Mistress Tessa, was enamored of Federigo di Neri Pegolotti. They arranged to meet at Gianni's country house in Camerata.
They devised a signal: an ass's skull on a vine pole in the vineyard. If the muzzle faced Florence, Federigo should come that evening; if towards Fiesole, he should not. If the door was shut, he should knock thrice. They met many times.
One night, Gianni unexpectedly returned home late, while Tessa was to sup with Federigo. Tessa had hidden two capons, eggs, and wine in the garden. Federigo arrived and knocked. Gianni heard it. Tessa feigned sleep, then awoke, claiming it was a phantom that had been frightening her. Gianni, believing her, recited prayers and crossed the bed.
Tessa, needing to warn Federigo, insisted they exorcise the phantom together. She claimed an anchoress taught her an effective orison. Gianni agreed. At the door, Tessa instructed Gianni to spit when she told him. She then chanted: ""Phantom, phantom that goest by night, with tail upright thou cam'st to us; now get thee gone with tail upright. Begone into the garden to the foot of the great peach tree; there shalt thou find an anointed twice-anointed one and an hundred turds of my sitting hen; set thy mouth to the flagon and get thee gone again and do thou no hurt to my Gianni nor to me."" Gianni spat.
Federigo, outside, heard everything, understood the message, and laughed. He went to the garden, found the capons, wine, and eggs, and supped at his ease. He and Tessa later laughed about the conjuration. Emilia mentions another version where the ass's skull was turned by a husbandman, leading Federigo to come mistakenly, and Tessa's conjuration was different, but both were true.

**Story 2: Peronella**
Filostrato tells of Peronella, a beautiful wife of a poor mason in Naples. She took a lover, Giannello Strignario. They arranged to meet when her husband left for work. One morning, Giannello was with Peronella when her husband unexpectedly returned. Peronella quickly hid Giannello in a large vat in the shed.
She opened the door, feigning anger at his early return, accusing him of idleness. The husband explained it was a holiday and he had sold the vat to a man waiting outside for five florins. Peronella, quick-witted, declared she had already sold it for seven florins to a man who was inside checking its soundness. The husband, pleased, sent away the first buyer.
Giannello emerged from the vat, feigning ignorance of the husband's return, and complained the vat was dirty. The husband, eager for the seven florins, agreed to clean it. While he was inside scraping, Peronella put her head and arm into the vat's mouth, directing him. Giannello, seeing the opportunity, lay with her, satisfying his desire. When the scraping was done, Giannello declared the vat clean, paid the seven florins, and had it carried to his house.

**Story 3: Fra Rinaldo**
Elisa tells of Rinaldo, a Siennese gentleman, who loved his neighbor, Madam Agnesa, wife of a rich man. She was pregnant. Rinaldo became godfather to her child, giving him a pretext to speak with her. He eventually became a friar, but later resumed his worldly appetites.
Fra Rinaldo began to visit his gossip, Agnesa, more frequently, pressing his suit. She, using the common female tactic, asked, ""How now, Fra Rinaldo? Do monks such things?"" He replied that without his gown, he was a man like any other. She hesitated, citing their gossipship as a great sin. He argued that God pardoned greater sins, and that he, being less kin to her child than her husband, could lie with her as her husband did. Agnesa, easily persuaded, yielded. They became secret lovers, their gossipship providing cover.
One day, Fra Rinaldo was with Agnesa in her bedchamber, having sent her maid away. Her husband unexpectedly returned. Agnesa, terrified, told Fra Rinaldo. He, half-dressed, feared discovery. Agnesa, seizing an idea, told him to dress, take their godchild, and listen to her. She opened the door to her husband, claiming Fra Rinaldo had been sent by God to cure their child, who had a fainting fit due to worms. She said Fra Rinaldo was conjuring the worms and only the mother could be present.
The simple husband believed her. Fra Rinaldo, having heard everything, dressed and took the child. He called out to the husband, telling him the child was cured by God's grace and St. Ambrose's intercession, and to make a waxen image for the saint. The husband, overjoyed, thanked Fra Rinaldo. Fra Rinaldo's comrade, who had been with the maid, also corroborated the story. The husband, believing the miracle, entertained the friars. Fra Rinaldo and Agnesa continued their affair.

**Story 4: Tofano**
Lauretta tells of Tofano, a jealous man in Arezzo, whose wife, Madam Ghita, was beautiful. Tofano's jealousy, without cause, angered Ghita. She decided to give him reason for his fear. She found a lover and, to facilitate their meetings, encouraged Tofano's love of drinking, often getting him intoxicated. She would then put him to bed and meet her lover, sometimes even at his house.
One evening, Tofano, suspecting her, feigned drunkenness. His wife, believing him, went to her lover's house. Tofano arose, locked the doors, and waited at the window. When Ghita returned, she found herself locked out. Tofano taunted her, saying she would not return until he had shamed her publicly.
Ghita pleaded, claiming she was at a neighbor's vigil. Tofano refused. She then threatened to cast herself into a nearby well, so he would be blamed for her death. Tofano, unmoved, told her to leave her distaff. Ghita, taking a large stone, cried ""God pardon me!"" and dropped it into the well. Tofano, believing she had jumped, rushed out to save her. Ghita, hidden near the door, slipped into the house and locked him out.
From the window, she taunted him, saying he should water his wine before drinking. Tofano, realizing he was fooled, demanded entry. Ghita, now shouting, accused him of returning drunk nightly. Neighbors awoke. Ghita, weeping, claimed Tofano was a drunkard who came home late. Tofano, like an ass, told the truth, but his story was disbelieved. Ghita's mother and brothers arrived, beat Tofano, and took Ghita home. Tofano, shamed and still loving his wife, sought reconciliation. He promised never to be jealous again and gave her leave to do as she pleased, provided she was discreet.

**Story 5: A Jealous Husband**
Fiammetta tells of a rich merchant in Arimino, who was excessively jealous of his beautiful wife without cause. He kept her so confined she couldn't even look out a window. She resolved to give him reason for his jealousy. She found a small fissure in the wall separating her house from a handsome young neighbor, Filippo. She enlarged the hole and, through it, communicated her love to Filippo, who reciprocated. They could touch hands but not meet due to the husband's vigilance.
For Christmas, the lady asked her husband for leave to confess and take sacrament. He, suspicious, agreed, but insisted she go to their parish chapel early and confess only to their chaplain or a designated priest, then return home immediately. The husband, before her, disguised himself as a priest with a flapped cowl and sat in the choir.
The lady, recognizing him, decided to give him what he sought. She confessed to being married and in love with a priest who came to her every night. She claimed he entered by magic, making her husband sleep with certain words. The disguised husband, furious, nearly abandoned the confession but pressed for more details. She insisted she loved the priest too much to stop. He offered to pray for her and send a clerk to check on her, but she warned against messengers, fearing her husband's jealousy. He promised secrecy.
The lady returned home, seeing her husband's anger. That night, he told her he would sup and lie abroad, instructing her to lock all doors. She, however, signaled Filippo through the hole, telling him her husband would be watching the door and to come by the roof.
The husband hid by the street door all night, cold and supperless, waiting for the priest. Filippo, meanwhile, entered by the roof and lay with the lady. In the morning, Filippo returned home. The husband, having seen no one, sent a boy (as the priest's clerk) to ask if the ""priest"" had visited. The lady replied he had not.
Finally, the husband, unable to contain himself, angrily demanded what she had confessed. She admitted telling the priest she loved a priest who came nightly, but then revealed she knew he was the disguised priest. She argued that he, her husband, was the ""priest"" she loved, and he came nightly to her bed. She mocked his jealousy and blindness, telling him he was a fool to think she would be unfaithful in such an obvious way. She swore that if she desired to cuckold him, she could do so even if he had a hundred eyes.
The jealous husband, realizing he had been fooled, accepted her explanation, believing her virtuous. The lady, now effectively licensed, brought her lover in through the door and continued her affair discreetly.

**Story 6: Madam Isabella**
Pampinea tells of Madam Isabella, a noble and beautiful Florentine lady, wife of a worthy gentleman. She took a lover, Leonetto, a well-bred young man. She was also pursued by Messer Lambertuccio, a powerful but disagreeable gentleman, whom she disliked but yielded to out of fear of dishonor.
One summer day, Isabella's husband was away in the country. She sent for Leonetto. While they were together, her maid announced Messer Lambertuccio's arrival, alone. Isabella, terrified, hid Leonetto behind the bed curtains. She received Lambertuccio, who embraced and kissed her, then went to her chamber.
As they were together, the maid announced the unexpected return of Isabella's husband. Isabella, realizing she had two men in the house and Lambertuccio's horse was visible, thought herself lost. She quickly told Lambertuccio to take his dagger, go down the stairs with an angry face, and leave, saying, ""I vow to God that I will take him elsewhere."" If her husband questioned him, he was to repeat this and ride off. Lambertuccio obeyed.
Her husband, dismounting in the courtyard, saw Lambertuccio leaving in a fury. He asked his wife what was happening. Isabella, moving towards the chamber where Leonetto was hidden, claimed a stranger had fled into her room, pursued by Lambertuccio with a dagger. She said she had blocked Lambertuccio from entering. Her husband praised her for preventing murder in their house. He asked where the young man was. Leonetto, hearing everything, emerged trembling. He claimed Lambertuccio had mistaken him for someone else and attacked him on the road. The husband, believing him, promised to escort Leonetto home. After supper, he took Leonetto back to Florence. Leonetto then secretly reconciled with Lambertuccio. The husband never learned of his wife's deception.

**Story 7: Lodovico**
Filomena tells of Lodovico, a rich young Florentine gentleman in Paris. He heard travelers praise Madam Beatrice, wife of Messer Egano de' Gulluzzi of Bologna, as the most beautiful lady. Lodovico fell in love by hearsay and, feigning a pilgrimage to the Holy Sepulchre, traveled to Bologna. He saw Beatrice and found her even more beautiful. He resolved to win her love.
He disguised himself as a servant named Anichino and took service with Messer Egano, who was a great hunter and kept many servants. Anichino quickly gained Egano's trust and managed all his affairs.
One day, Egano was hunting. Beatrice played chess with Anichino. When her women left them alone, Anichino sighed deeply. Beatrice, curious, asked the cause. He confessed his true identity, his love for her, and why he had taken service with her husband. He humbly begged her to reciprocate his love. Beatrice, moved by his passion, confessed her own love and promised to meet him that night after midnight, leaving her door open. She gave him a kiss as a pledge.
That night, Egano, tired from hunting, went to bed early. Beatrice left her door open. Anichino entered. As he put his hand on her breast, she awoke Egano. She then asked Egano who was his most trusted servant. Egano replied Anichino. Beatrice then accused Anichino of soliciting her love that day. She claimed she had agreed to meet him in the garden at the foot of the pine tree after midnight, to expose him. She suggested Egano disguise himself in her gown and veil and go in her place.
Egano, eager to test Anichino's fidelity, agreed. He dressed in his wife's clothes and went to the garden. As soon as he left, Beatrice locked the door. Anichino, who had been terrified, was overjoyed. He and Beatrice lay together, taking pleasure. After a while, she told him to take a stout cudgel, go to the garden, and beat Egano (disguised as her), pretending to rebuke her for coming.
Anichino went to the garden and, finding Egano, beat him soundly, calling him a ""wicked woman."" Egano fled back to the chamber, bruised and confused. Beatrice, feigning concern, asked if Anichino had come. Egano recounted the beating and the harsh words. Beatrice then praised Anichino's loyalty. Egano, convinced he had the truest wife and servant, believed the pear tree was enchanted. Anichino and Beatrice continued their affair discreetly.

**Story 8: A Jealous Husband**
Neifile tells of Arriguccio Berlinghieri, a rich Florentine merchant, who married Madam Sismonda, a gentlewoman. Arriguccio, often abroad, became extremely jealous. He would not sleep until he felt her in bed. Sismonda, unable to meet her lover Ruberto, devised a plan. She tied a twine to her great toe, running it out her window to the street. Ruberto would pull it at midnight. If Arriguccio slept, she would release it and open the door; if not, she would hold it fast.
One night, Arriguccio felt the twine, pulled it, and found it tied to his wife's toe. He cut it, tied it to his own, and waited. Ruberto pulled the twine. Arriguccio, thinking it was his wife, rushed to the door, armed. Ruberto, hearing the door open loudly, realized it was Arriguccio and fled. Arriguccio pursued him, and they fought.
Sismonda, waking and finding the twine cut, knew she was discovered. She quickly persuaded her maid to take her place in bed, enduring any beating, promising to reward her. Sismonda then put out the light and hid.
Arriguccio, failing to catch Ruberto, returned home enraged. In the dark, he found the maid in bed, thinking her his wife. He beat her severely, bruising her face and cutting off her hair, while she cried for mercy. He then locked her in the room and went to Sismonda's brothers to report her infidelity and demand they take her away.
Sismonda, hearing all, emerged, rekindled the light, and comforted her maid, promising a reward. She then remade the bed, dressed, and sat sewing at the stairhead, feigning innocence.
Her brothers and mother arrived. Arriguccio recounted his story, showing them the maid's hair as proof. The brothers, enraged, went to the chamber. Sismonda, appearing calm and uninjured, denied everything. Arriguccio, astonished, insisted he had beaten her. Sismonda showed her unblemished face and unshorn hair. She then accused Arriguccio of being a drunkard who frequented taverns and trulls, claiming he had mistaken one of his harlots for her and beaten her.
Her mother, furious at Arriguccio's accusations, berated him, calling him a ""four-farthing huckster"" unworthy of her daughter. The brothers, convinced Arriguccio was drunk or mad, warned him never to repeat such accusations. Arriguccio, confused, left his wife in peace. Sismonda, by her wit, not only escaped peril but secured future freedom for her pleasures.

**Story 9: Lydia**
Pamfilo tells of Nicostratus, a nobleman in Argos, who married the high-spirited Lydia in his old age. Nicostratus loved hunting and trusted his handsome, well-bred servant, Pyrrhus, above all. Lydia fell passionately in love with Pyrrhus. Pyrrhus, unaware or unwilling, showed no interest. Lydia, desperate, confided in her chamberwoman, Lusca, asking her to convey her love to Pyrrhus.
Pyrrhus, suspecting a trick, replied roughly, refusing to dishonor his master. Lusca, undeterred, returned to Lydia, who, after some days, sent her back to Pyrrhus. Lusca persuaded him, arguing that fortune offered him a great opportunity and that loyalty between servants and masters was not absolute.
Pyrrhus, still wary of a trick, agreed to reciprocate if Lydia performed three impossible tasks in Nicostratus's presence: slay his favorite hawk, send him a lock of his beard, and one of his best teeth. Lydia, aided by Love and her wit, accepted, promising to also lie with him in Nicostratus's presence and make her husband believe it was not real.
Lydia first killed Nicostratus's hawk, claiming it robbed her of her husband's time. The guests laughed, and Nicostratus's anger turned to amusement. Next, while toying with Nicostratus, she plucked a lock of his beard, claiming it was an accident. Finally, she convinced Nicostratus he had bad breath due to a rotten tooth. She offered to pull it herself, and, sending everyone else away, extracted one of his teeth, showing him a decayed one she had ready. She sent the lock of hair and the tooth to Pyrrhus.
Now, to lie with Pyrrhus in Nicostratus's presence, Lydia feigned illness and asked Nicostratus and Pyrrhus to carry her to the garden. She sat under a pear tree and asked Pyrrhus to climb it for pears. As Pyrrhus threw down pears, he pretended to see Nicostratus and Lydia making love below, crying out in feigned shock. Nicostratus, astonished, climbed the tree to see. While he was in the tree, Lydia and Pyrrhus made love below. Nicostratus, seeing them, cried out. The lovers, having finished, reseated themselves.
Nicostratus descended, enraged. Pyrrhus then argued that Nicostratus must have seen falsely, just as he himself had, attributing the illusion to the pear tree. Lydia, feigning anger, agreed, demanding the pear tree be cut down to prevent such shame. Pyrrhus cut it down. Nicostratus, convinced by their arguments, believed the tree was enchanted. He forgave his wife and Pyrrhus. Pyrrhus and Lydia continued their affair at ease.

**Story 10: Two Siennese**
The king tells of Tingoccio Mini and Meuccio di Tura, two Siennese friends. They promised that the first to die would return to tell the other about the afterlife. Tingoccio became godfather to Mistress Mita, a beautiful lady, and fell in love with her. Meuccio also loved her, but both kept their love secret from each other.
Tingoccio eventually lay with his gossip. Meuccio, aware, feigned ignorance. Tingoccio, from his exertions with his gossip, fell ill and died. Three days later, Tingoccio's ghost appeared to Meuccio, confirming his death and his torment for sins. Meuccio asked about punishments for various sins. Tingoccio replied, then asked Meuccio to say masses and alms for him. Meuccio agreed.
Meuccio then asked about the punishment for lying with his gossip. Tingoccio replied that in the afterlife, ""no manner of account [is] taken of gossips."" Meuccio, hearing this, laughed at his own past restraint and resolved to be wiser in the future. The king concludes that if Fra Rinaldo had known this, he wouldn't have needed to use syllogisms to persuade his gossip.

**Day the Seventh - Conclusion**
Dioneo's story made the ladies laugh. Lauretta, her reign ending, crowned Emilia as queen. Emilia announced that for the next day, there would be no fixed theme, allowing everyone to discourse as they pleased, for variety and rest. All approved. They enjoyed the garden, some walking barefoot in the water. Dioneo and Fiammetta sang. After supper, Pamfilo sang a song about his joy in love. The king dismissed them to rest.

**Day the Eighth**
**Introduction**
On Sunday morning, the queen and company walked in the dewy grass, visited a church, and returned for breakfast. After singing and dancing, they rested. After meridian, they reassembled by the fountain. Neifile was commanded to begin the day's stories.

**Story 1: Gulfardo**
Neifile tells of Gulfardo, a German soldier in Milan, known for loyalty and prompt repayment of loans. He fell in love with Madam Ambruogia, wife of a rich merchant, Guasparruolo Cagastraccio, his friend. Lydia, after much solicitation, agreed to Gulfardo's desires if he kept it secret and gave her 200 gold florins.
Gulfardo, indignant at her greed, decided to trick her. He agreed to her terms, saying he would bring the money and only tell a trusted comrade. Lydia, pleased, told him her husband would go to Genoa soon. Gulfardo then went to Guasparruolo and borrowed 200 gold florins at interest.
When Guasparruolo went to Genoa, Lydia sent for Gulfardo. He came with his comrade and, in his comrade's presence, handed Lydia the 200 florins, saying, ""Madam, take these monies and give them to your husband, whenas he shall be returned."" Lydia, thinking he did this to hide the payment from his friend, took the money, counted it, and put it away. She then lay with Gulfardo.
When Guasparruolo returned, Gulfardo, with his comrade, went to him in Lydia's presence. He told Guasparruolo he was returning the 200 florins he had lent him, having given them to Lydia. Guasparruolo asked his wife, who, seeing the witness, could not deny it. She confirmed she had the money. Guasparruolo was satisfied. Lydia, realizing she was tricked, gave her husband the money. Thus, Gulfardo enjoyed his mistress without cost.

**Story 2: The Parish Priest of Varlungo**
Pamfilo tells of a lusty parish priest in Varlungo who was enamored of Mistress Belcolore, a jolly, buxom country wench, wife of Bentivegna del Mazzo. The priest made her small gifts and flirted, but she feigned modesty.
One day, the priest met Bentivegna, who was going to Florence. The priest, seeing his chance, went to Belcolore. He declared his love and desire. She, feigning reluctance, asked if priests did such things. He assured her they did, and ""grind with a full head of water,"" promising her profit. She asked what profit, as priests were stingy. He offered shoes, a head-lace, or a waistband. She refused, saying she had enough. She then proposed a service: if he lent her five crowns to redeem her gown and girdle for Saturday (when she needed to go to Florence), she would do his will.
The priest, not having the money on him, offered his blue-cloth cloak as a pledge. Belcolore, after some haggling over its value, took the cloak. They went to the barn, and the priest lay with her. He then returned to the parsonage.
Later, regretting the cloak, the priest devised a plan. The next day, a holiday, he sent a boy to Belcolore, asking to borrow her stone mortar for making sauce. She sent it. Towards dinner, the priest sent his clerk to return the mortar and ask for the cloak left ""by way of token."" Bentivegna, hearing this, angrily told his wife to return the cloak immediately. Belcolore, grumbling, gave it back, telling the clerk to tell the priest she'd never lend him her mortar again. The priest, amused, sent a message back: if she wouldn't lend her mortar, he wouldn't lend his pestle. Belcolore, though grudging, eventually made peace with him over must and roast chestnuts, and they continued their affair.

**Story 3: Calandrino, Bruno, and Buffalmacco (Heliotrope)**
Elisa tells of Calandrino, a simple-witted painter, and his merry, shrewd companions, Bruno and Buffalmacco. Maso del Saggio, a witty young man, decided to play a trick on Calandrino. In the church of San Giovanni, Maso and a friend discussed the virtues of stones, knowing Calandrino was listening.
Maso described the fantastical land of Bengodi, where food was abundant and cheap. Calandrino, believing him, asked about wonder-working stones. Maso described the ""Heliotrope,"" a black stone found in the Mugnone, which made its bearer invisible. Calandrino, excited, resolved to find it.
He sought Bruno and Buffalmacco, telling them of the invisible stone and his plan to steal money from changers. They feigned astonishment and agreed to help. Bruno suggested they search on a holiday morning, when the stones would be blacker and fewer people would be around.
On Sunday, they went to the Mugnone. Calandrino, eager, picked up every black stone he found, stuffing his bosom and cloak. When he was heavily laden, Bruno and Buffalmacco pretended to lose sight of him, saying he must have gone home. Calandrino, believing the stone worked, remained silent and started for home. Bruno and Buffalmacco followed, pelting him with stones, pretending he wasn't there.
At the city gate, customs officers, forewarned, feigned not to see Calandrino. He reached home, laden. His wife, Tessa, seeing him late, began to scold him. Calandrino, realizing he was visible, was furious. He cried, ""Alack, wicked woman that thou art, wast thou there? Thou hast undone me!"" He then beat her severely, blaming her for making the stone lose its virtue.
Bruno and Buffalmacco arrived, feigning concern. Calandrino, still angry, explained he had found the heliotrope, but his wife's presence had ruined its power. The friends, barely containing their laughter, pretended to believe him. They eventually appeased him, blaming him for not warning his wife, and left him disconsolate with a house full of stones.

**Story 4: The Rector of Fiesole**
Emilia tells of a rector in Fiesole who fell in love with Madam Piccarda, a noble widow. He was old in years but young in wit, arrogant, and ill-mannered. Piccarda hated him but, to be rid of his importunities, consulted her brothers. She then feigned to yield to the rector, telling him she was now disposed to be his.
The rector, overjoyed, boasted of his success, saying women were like silver that wouldn't stand the hammer. He asked when and where they could meet. She said her house was too small and her brothers slept nearby, so they would have to be silent and in the dark. He agreed for a night or two.
Piccarda had a very ugly, crooked, squinting maid named Ciutazza. Piccarda bribed Ciutazza with a new shift to lie with the rector in the dark, silent, in her bed.
That night, the rector arrived. Ciutazza, well-instructed, lay with him. The rector, thinking it was Piccarda, embraced and kissed her, enjoying himself. Meanwhile, Piccarda's brothers, executing the rest of the plot, went to the great square. The Bishop, who was visiting, desired to drink with them. They brought him back to their house.
The brothers then led the Bishop and others to the chamber where the rector and Ciutazza were. The rector, awakened by the light, was horrified. The Bishop severely reprimanded him. The rector, seeing Ciutazza, realized the trick. He was sent home under guard for penance. The Bishop, learning the full story, commended Piccarda and her brothers. The rector, shamed, was mocked by children and tormented by his regret. Ciutazza got her shift and a merry night.

**Story 5: Three Young Men Pull the Breeches Off a Marchegan Judge**
Filostrato tells of Maso del Saggio and his two comrades, Ribi and Matteuzzo. Governors from the Marches of Ancona, known for their meanness, often brought ill-suited judges to Florence. One such judge, Messer Niccola da San Lepidio, looked more like a tinker than a lawyer. Maso observed his ill-fitting breeches, which hung halfway down his legs.
Maso showed the judge to his comrades. They noticed the judge's platform had broken boards underneath. Maso proposed they pull off his breeches. The next morning, in a crowded court, Matteuzzo crept under the bench. Maso and Ribi approached the judge, each grabbing a skirt of his gown, and loudly feigned a dispute over stolen saddle-bags and boothose. The judge stood up to hear them better. Matteuzzo, seizing the moment, pulled down Messer Niccola's breeches.
The judge, thin and lank, felt his breeches fall. He tried to sit and cover himself, but Maso and Ribi held him, continuing their loud dispute, ensuring everyone saw his shame. Matteuzzo then escaped. Maso and Ribi also fled. The judge, pulling up his breeches, was furious. The Provost, informed, realized the trick was a subtle criticism of his choice of judges. He decided to keep silent.

**Story 6: Bruno and Buffalmacco (Pig)**
Filomena tells of Calandrino, who owned a farm and kept a pig. One year, his wife was ill, so he went alone to kill the pig. Bruno and Buffalmacco, staying with a priest neighbor, saw him. They suggested he sell the pig and tell his wife it was stolen, but Calandrino refused, fearing his wife's wrath.
Bruno and Buffalmacco decided to steal the pig. They took Calandrino to the tavern with the priest, where they got him drunk. Calandrino, leaving his door open, went to bed. The two painters stole the pig and took it to the priest's house.
The next morning, Calandrino discovered his pig missing and made a great outcry. Bruno and Buffalmacco arrived, feigning sympathy. Calandrino, distraught, insisted it was stolen. Bruno pretended to doubt him, then suggested an ordeal by ""ginger boluses and good vernage"" to identify the thief among his neighbors. Calandrino, desperate, agreed and gave Bruno money for the ingredients.
Bruno bought ginger boluses and two dog-balls compounded with aloes, disguised as boluses, marking them. He returned and instructed Calandrino to invite his neighbors to drink. The next morning, Bruno and Buffalmacco brought the pills and wine. Bruno explained that the thief would find the pill bitter and spit it out.
They lined up the guests, including Calandrino. Bruno gave Calandrino one of the aloes-laced dog-balls. Calandrino spat it out due to the bitterness. Bruno gave him another, which he also spat out, weeping. Everyone concluded Calandrino had stolen the pig himself.
After the guests left, Bruno and Buffalmacco accused Calandrino of trying to trick them and his wife. They demanded two pairs of capons as blackmail, threatening to tell his wife. Calandrino, fearing his wife's scolding, paid them. They salted the pig and took the capons, leaving Calandrino to his loss and shame.

**Story 7: A Scholar**
Pampinea tells of Elena, a beautiful, haughty widow in Florence, who had a lover. Rinieri, a learned scholar returned from Paris, fell passionately in love with her. Elena, vain, noticed his admiration and encouraged him, believing she had ""caught a woodcock by the bill."" She made him believe she returned his love but kept him at bay with vague promises.
To prove to her lover (who was growing jealous) that Rinieri was no threat, Elena sent her maid to tell Rinieri she would meet him on Christmas Eve in her courtyard. Rinieri, overjoyed, went there. It had snowed heavily. Elena, after supping with her lover, led him to a lattice to watch the scholar. The maid told Rinieri her brother was visiting, delaying Elena. Rinieri, believing her, patiently waited in the freezing courtyard.
Elena and her lover watched Rinieri dance in the snow to warm himself. She mocked him. Later, she called to him from the door, still feigning her brother's presence, telling him to wait. Rinieri, now freezing, begged to be let in, but she refused, claiming the door would make too much noise. She told him to make a fire to warm himself, mocking his claim of burning with love.
Rinieri, realizing he was fooled, his love turned to fierce hatred. He resolved to take revenge. He feigned continued love.
Later, Elena's lover abandoned her for another. Her maid, pitying her, suggested the scholar, a necromancer, could bring her lover back. Elena, foolishly, agreed. The maid told Rinieri, who was overjoyed. He told Elena he would help but needed to speak with her personally.
Elena met him, confessed her plight, and begged for his help. Rinieri, feigning reluctance, agreed to use necromancy, despite his oath. He instructed her to bathe naked seven times in a running stream at midnight, then climb an uninhabited tower, and, facing north, recite certain words with a pewter image. Two damsels would appear, to whom she should state her desire, and her lover would return.
Elena, believing him, chose her farm near the Arno, with a nearby tower. Rinieri, knowing the location, hid with his servant near the tower. Elena, at midnight, bathed naked in the Arno. Rinieri, seeing her, felt both pity and lust, but his desire for revenge prevailed.
Elena climbed the tower and recited the conjuration. No damsels appeared. At dawn, she realized she had been tricked. She tried to descend but found the ladder gone. She collapsed in despair, lamenting her lost honor. Rinieri, waking from a short sleep, saw her and taunted her, asking if the damsels had come. Elena, weeping, begged him to come up.
Rinieri, entering the tower, continued to mock her, refusing to help her down or give her clothes. He compared her cold night to his own, saying his revenge was just. He rejected her pleas for pity, calling her a ""venomous serpent"" and saying her death would be a ""chastisement,"" not vengeance. He told her to cast herself down.
Elena, desperate, continued to plead. Rinieri, enjoying her torment, prolonged the conversation. He reminded her of her past mockery and his superior wit. He said he had other ways to shame her, including writing about her. He claimed young men were fickle and boastful, unlike older, experienced men. He said her beauty was fleeting and she was a ""worthless trull.""
Elena, seeing his cruelty, begged him by his new lover's love to fetch her clothes. Rinieri, laughing, agreed, asking where they were. She told him. He left, instructing his servant to guard the tower, then went to a friend's house to dine and sleep.
Elena remained on the tower, suffering from the intense sun, thirst, and insect bites. She became sunburned and covered in blood. A husbandman, searching for lost swine, found her. He helped her down and brought her to his house. Her maid, returning to the tower, fell from the ladder and broke her thigh. The husbandman brought the maid to Elena.
That night, Elena and her maid were taken to Florence. Elena, with her wit, fabricated a story of diabolical bewitchments. Physicians treated her and her maid. Elena, cured, gave up loving and mocking others. Rinieri, hearing of the maid's broken thigh, felt fully avenged.

**Story 8: Two Men Consorting Together**
Fiammetta tells of Spinelloccio Tanena and Zeppa di Mino, two Siennese neighbors and close friends. Each had a beautiful wife. Spinelloccio became lovers with Zeppa's wife. One day, Zeppa, hidden, saw Spinelloccio kissing his wife and then going into a chamber with her. Zeppa, enraged, decided on a subtle revenge.
After Spinelloccio left, Zeppa confronted his wife, who confessed. Zeppa, to pardon her, instructed her to invite Spinelloccio to her house the next day, hide him in a chest when Zeppa returned, and lock him in. She agreed.
The next day, Spinelloccio, feigning a dinner engagement, went to Zeppa's house and joined his wife. Zeppa returned, and his wife locked Spinelloccio in the chest. Zeppa then told his wife to invite Spinelloccio's wife to dine, as Spinelloccio was out. Spinelloccio's wife came.
Zeppa, taking Spinelloccio's wife into the chamber, locked the door. He revealed he knew about Spinelloccio and his wife. He said he loved Spinelloccio as a brother and would take revenge in kind: ""he hath had my wife and I mean to have thee."" Spinelloccio's wife, believing him, agreed, asking only for peace with Zeppa's wife. Zeppa then lay with her on the chest, where Spinelloccio was hidden.
Spinelloccio, hearing and feeling everything, was furious but realized his own offense. He resolved to remain Zeppa's friend. After Zeppa finished, Spinelloccio's wife asked for the promised jewel. Zeppa opened the chest, revealing Spinelloccio, saying, ""Here is the jewel I promised thee."" Spinelloccio, emerging, declared, ""Zeppa, we are quits,"" and proposed they share their wives. Zeppa agreed. All four then dined together in harmony, and thereafter, each lady had two husbands and each man two wives, without strife.

**Story 9: Master Simone the Physician**
The queen tells of Master Simone da Villa, a doctor from Bologna, rich but unlearned, who returned to Florence with a scarlet gown and miniver hood. He was curious about people. He befriended Bruno and Buffalmacco, two poor painters, believing they had a secret source of wealth.
Bruno, realizing Simone's foolishness, decided to trick him. He claimed he and Buffalmacco were part of a secret ""roving"" company that met twice a month. At these meetings, they could have anything they desired: magnificent feasts, gold and silver vessels, music, and beautiful women (queens and empresses from around the world). He claimed he often sent for the Queen of England, and Buffalmacco for the Queen of France. He called this ""going a-roving,"" taking what they wanted and returning it later. He warned Simone of the secrecy required.
Simone, believing this, was consumed with desire to join. He began to lavish hospitality on Bruno. Bruno, in return, painted a picture of Lent, an Agnus Dei, and a chamber-pot for Simone's house. He continued to tantalize Simone with tales of their ""roving"" adventures.
Simone, thinking his hospitality earned him the right, finally asked to join the company, boasting of his own wit and a beautiful serving-wench he desired. Bruno, barely containing his laughter, feigned reluctance, then agreed to help, on condition of secrecy. He explained that Buffalmacco would be captain next month and he a counselor, and Simone should gain Buffalmacco's friendship.
Simone befriended Buffalmacco, showering him and Bruno with dinners. When Simone asked Buffalmacco to admit him, Buffalmacco feigned anger at Bruno for revealing the secret. Simone pacified him. Buffalmacco then praised Simone's ""Bolognese"" wisdom, saying he was ""baptized on a Sunday"" (a simpleton) but knew how to ""catch men."" He promised to admit him.
The painters then told Simone he was accepted. The night before the assembly, Simone dined with them. Buffalmacco instructed him to go to a tomb outside Santa Maria Novella, dressed in his scarlet gown, and wait for a ""black horned beast"" (Buffalmacco in disguise). He was to mount it without calling on God or saints, cross his hands, and be carried to the meeting. If he showed fear, he would be cast into a ""stinking place.""
Simone, boasting of his courage, agreed. He dressed in his scarlet gown and waited on a tomb. Buffalmacco, disguised as a horned bear, appeared, making terrifying noises. Simone, though terrified, mounted the ""beast."" Buffalmacco carried him to a trench full of ordure near Ripole and pitched him in headfirst. He then fled with Bruno.
Simone, covered in filth, struggled out of the trench, losing his bonnet. He returned home, stinking. His wife furiously berated him, accusing him of gallivanting with other women. The next morning, Bruno and Buffalmacco, having painted themselves with bruises, visited Simone. They feigned anger, claiming he had caused them to be beaten for his disloyalty. Simone, terrified, tried to explain his mishap, but they refused to listen. He begged forgiveness and continued to lavish them with gifts and banquets to keep them silent.

**Story 10: A Woman of Sicily**
Dioneo tells of a custom in Palermo where merchants stored goods in a customhouse. Women, known as ""barberesses"" (prostitutes), would learn of a merchant's wealth from the customhouse books and then seduce and rob them.
Salabaetto, a young Florentine merchant, arrived in Palermo with 500 gold florins' worth of woollen cloths. He displayed his purse and was noticed by Madam Biancofiore, a beautiful barberess. She sent her maid to him, claiming to be deeply in love and inviting him to a bagnio. Salabaetto, believing her, agreed.
At the bagnio, slave-girls prepared a luxurious bath and bed. Biancofiore arrived, embraced Salabaetto, and they bathed together. She personally washed him. They were then carried to bed, sprinkled with perfumes, and offered sweetmeats and fine wines. Salabaetto, believing himself in paradise, was completely captivated. They spent the night together. In the morning, she gave him a silver girdle and purse, pledging her devotion.
Salabaetto sold his cloths at a good profit. Biancofiore, hearing of his wealth, resolved to get more. She invited him to supper. After much lovemaking, she feigned receiving letters that her brother would be executed if she didn't send 1,000 gold florins within eight days. Salabaetto, believing her tears, offered her 500 florins, which she accepted, promising to repay him in a fortnight.
After receiving the money, Biancofiore became distant. When the repayment was overdue, she gave him excuses. Salabaetto realized he was tricked. Ashamed, he left Palermo for Naples, where he confided in Pietro dello Canigiano, a shrewd Florentine. Canigiano devised a plan.
Salabaetto, with money from Canigiano, bought bales of tow and twenty casks of seawater, with a little oil on top. He returned to Palermo, declared the goods (worth 2,000 florins, with 3,000 more expected) at the customhouse, and stored them, claiming he awaited more merchandise.
Biancofiore, hearing of his new wealth, regretted taking only 500 florins. She sent for him, feigning to return his money because she didn't want him to be ""vexed."" Salabaetto, playing along, told her he had returned to Palermo to be near her, having sold most of his possessions for her love. She, feigning great love, returned his 500 florins.
Later, Biancofiore, fearing he would go to Monaco (where his expected merchandise was supposedly held for ransom), offered to lend him 1,000 florins at 30% interest, secured by his customhouse goods. Salabaetto agreed. She lent him the money, and he signed over his goods.
Salabaetto then sailed to Naples with 1,500 florins, repaid Canigiano, and laughed at the Sicilian trickstress. He then went to Ferrara, abandoning trade. Biancofiore, realizing Salabaetto had left, opened his magazines. She found the casks full of seawater and the bales filled with tow, except for two. She had been tricked, losing 1,500 florins. She often lamented, ""Who with a Tuscan hath to do, Must nor be blind nor see askew.""

**Day the Eighth - Conclusion**
Dioneo's story made the ladies laugh. Emilia, her reign ending, crowned Elisa as queen. Elisa, blushing, accepted. She proposed the theme for the next day: ""OF WHOSO, BEING ASSAILED WITH SOME JIBING SPEECH, HATH VINDICATED HIMSELF OR HATH WITH SOME READY REPLY OR ADVISEMENT ESCAPED LOSS, PERIL OR SHAME."" All approved. They enjoyed supper and dancing. Dioneo, asked to sing, offered several bawdy songs, which the queen rejected. He then sang a song about his love. The queen dismissed them to rest.

**Day the Ninth**
**Introduction**
At dawn, Queen Emilia led her company to a nearby coppice, where tame animals (wild goats, deer) awaited them. They played with the animals, then returned to the palace, adorned with garlands. After dinner and entertainment, they reassembled. Filomena was asked to begin the day's stories.

**Story 1: Madam Francesca**
Filomena tells of Madam Francesca de' Lazzari, a beautiful widow in Pistoia. Two Florentine exiles, Rinuccio Palermini and Alessandro Chiarmontesi, loved her. Francesca, tired of their importunities, devised a plan to get rid of them.
A notoriously wicked and deformed man named Scannadio had just died and been buried in a tomb outside the Minor Friars' church. Francesca told her maid to go first to Alessandro. She was to tell him that Francesca would grant him her love if he would go to Scannadio's tomb that night, put on the dead man's clothes, and pretend to be Scannadio until he was carried to her house. He was to remain silent and motionless, and then he could stay with her. If he refused, he was never to approach her again.
The maid was then to go to Rinuccio and tell him Francesca would grant him her love if he would go to Scannadio's tomb at midnight, quietly take the body, and bring it to her house, without speaking.
Both men, eager for her love, agreed. Alessandro, on his way to the tomb, became terrified, fearing a trap or injury. However, his love drove him on. He opened the tomb, stripped Scannadio, dressed in his clothes, and lay in his place, trembling with fear.
Rinuccio, also fearing capture by the police, was driven by love to the tomb. He opened it, found Alessandro (whom he thought was Scannadio), hoisted him onto his shoulders, and carried him towards Francesca's house. He bumped Alessandro against benches in the dark.
Near Francesca's house, the watch, ambushed for an outlaw, saw them and cried out. Rinuccio dropped Alessandro and fled. Alessandro, hampered by the long clothes, also fled. Francesca, from her window, saw Rinuccio carrying Alessandro in Scannadio's clothes and laughed. She praised God for ridding her of them.
Rinuccio, finding Alessandro gone, returned home. Alessandro also returned home. The next day, Scannadio's tomb was found open and empty (Alessandro had rolled the body to the bottom of the vault). Both lovers claimed to have fulfilled her request, but Francesca, feigning disbelief, dismissed them, refusing her love.

**Story 2: An Abbess**
Elisa tells of Isabetta, a noble and beautiful young nun in a convent in Lombardy. She fell in love with a handsome young man, and they became secret lovers, meeting many times. One night, another nun saw him leaving Isabetta's cell. The nuns, instead of denouncing her immediately, decided to catch her in the act with the abbess, Madam Usimbalda, as a witness.
One night, Isabetta's lover visited. The watchful nuns, after a while, ran to the abbess's chamber. The abbess was secretly with a priest, whom she often let into her cell in a chest. Hearing the nuns' cries, she hastily dressed in the dark. Mistaking the priest's breeches for her coif, she put them on her head. She locked her door and rushed with the nuns to Isabetta's cell.
They broke open the door and found Isabetta and her lover in bed. The abbess furiously berated Isabetta for shaming the convent. Isabetta, ashamed, remained silent. But then she looked up and saw the abbess wearing the priest's breeches on her head, with the hose-points hanging down.
Isabetta, reassured, said, ""Madam, God aid you, tie up your coif and after say what you will to me."" The abbess, not understanding, continued her scolding. Isabetta repeated her request. Other nuns looked up, saw the breeches, and realized the abbess's own transgression. The abbess, seeing her own fault exposed, changed her tone. She concluded that it was impossible to resist carnal desires and declared that each nun should discreetly enjoy herself. She freed Isabetta and returned to her priest. Isabetta continued to meet her lover, and other nuns also sought secret pleasures.

**Story 3: Master Simone, Bruno, Buffalmacco, and Nello (Calandrino's pregnancy)**
Filostrato tells of Calandrino, who inherited 200 crowns. He talked of buying an estate but was too miserly to spend. Bruno and Buffalmacco, with their friend Nello, decided to trick him into paying for their entertainment.
Nello approached Calandrino, asking if he was ill, saying he looked ""changed."" Buffalmacco then approached, saying Calandrino looked ""half dead."" Calandrino, believing them, felt ill. Bruno suggested he go home, get into bed, and send his urine to Master Simone, the doctor (who was in on the trick).
Bruno went to Simone, explained the prank, and then the maid arrived with Calandrino's urine. Simone, after examining it, told the maid to tell Calandrino to stay warm and he would visit. Simone and Bruno went to Calandrino. Simone, after feeling his pulse, declared, in front of Calandrino's wife, that Calandrino was pregnant.
Calandrino roared, blaming his wife, Tessa, for always wanting to be on top. Tessa, a modest woman, blushed and left. Calandrino lamented how he would give birth and feared the pain, wishing he could beat his wife. Bruno, Buffalmacco, and Nello struggled to contain their laughter.
Calandrino begged Simone for help. Simone promised to deliver him in a few days for a small expense. Calandrino offered his 200 crowns. Simone said he needed three pairs of fat capons and five silver crowns for other medicines. Calandrino gave Bruno the money.
Simone sent a clary (medicinal drink) to Calandrino. Bruno, Buffalmacco, and Nello ate the capons and other good things. Calandrino drank the clary for three mornings. Simone then declared him cured. Calandrino, overjoyed, boasted of how Simone had ""unbegotten him with child"" in three days. Tessa, realizing the trick, continued to scold her husband.

**Story 4: Cecco Fortarrigo**
Neifile tells of two Siennese men, both named Cecco: Angiolieri and Fortarrigo. Both were disliked by their fathers and were friends. Angiolieri, a handsome and well-mannered man, decided to seek fortune with a cardinal in Ancona. He got money from his father and sought a servant. Fortarrigo, a gambler and drunkard, begged to come, promising to avoid his vices. Angiolieri reluctantly agreed.
They dined at Buonconvento. Angiolieri slept, charging Fortarrigo to wake him. Fortarrigo went to the tavern, gambled away his money, then his clothes. He then stole Angiolieri's money from his purse and lost that too.
Angiolieri awoke, found his money gone, and Fortarrigo missing. He prepared to leave, intending to get a new servant. As he was about to pay, he realized he had no money. He made an outcry, accusing the inn of robbery. Fortarrigo, in his shirt, appeared, asking Angiolieri to wait, as he had pawned his doublet and could redeem it cheaply. Angiolieri, learning Fortarrigo had stolen his money, was enraged but feared causing a scene. He threatened Fortarrigo and mounted his horse.
Fortarrigo, still in his shirt, trotted after him for two miles, demanding his doublet. Angiolieri, to escape him, spurred his horse. Fortarrigo then saw husbandmen in a field and cried, ""Stop him, stop him! He robbed me!"" The husbandmen, believing Fortarrigo, stopped Angiolieri. Fortarrigo accused Angiolieri of robbing him and leaving him naked. Angiolieri's protests were ignored. Fortarrigo, with the countrymen's help, stripped Angiolieri, put on his clothes, mounted his palfrey, and rode back to Siena, claiming he had won them from Angiolieri. Angiolieri, left in his shirt, returned to Buonconvento and eventually to his kin in Corsignano.

**Story 5: Calandrino (Niccolosa)**
Fiammetta tells another story of Calandrino. Niccolo Cornacchini hired Bruno, Buffalmacco, Nello, and Calandrino to paint his mansion at Camerata. Niccolo's son, Filippo, often brought women there. One day, Filippo brought Niccolosa, a beautiful and well-dressed woman.
Calandrino, going for water, saw Niccolosa and was instantly smitten. Bruno, noticing Calandrino's sighs, learned of his infatuation. Calandrino believed she was Filippo's wife and that she loved him. Bruno, Buffalmacco, and Nello decided to play a trick.
Bruno told Calandrino that Niccolosa was indeed Filippo's wife and that she was melting for him. Calandrino, overjoyed, boasted of his irresistible charm. Bruno suggested he bring his rebeck and sing to her. Calandrino, believing he was a master seducer, agreed. He brought his rebeck and sang, to the amusement of the others. He spent all his time trying to see Niccolosa, who, following Bruno's instructions, gave him ample opportunity. Bruno acted as a go-between, delivering letters and gifts (combs, purses, knives) from Calandrino, and bringing back worthless rings as ""tokens"" from Niccolosa.
After two months, Calandrino, impatient, urged Bruno to arrange a meeting. Bruno, having arranged with Niccolosa and Filippo, told Calandrino he would make her yield. He instructed Calandrino to bring virgin parchment, a live bat, frankincense, and a blessed candle. Bruno prepared a ""talisman"" script, telling Calandrino that touching Niccolosa with it would make her follow him and do his will. He told Calandrino to meet her in the barn if Filippo was away.
Nello, in on the trick, went to Calandrino's wife, Tessa, and told her Calandrino was having an affair with a woman at the mansion and was meeting her that day. Tessa, enraged, went to the mansion with Nello.
Filippo, seeing Nello and Tessa approach, told the painters he was leaving for Florence and hid. Calandrino, seeing Filippo gone, found Niccolosa, touched her with the script, and went to the barn. Niccolosa followed, locked the door, and, astride him on the straw, embraced him, praising him as her ""sweet Calandrino.""
Bruno, Buffalmacco, and Filippo, hidden, watched and listened, laughing. Tessa, led by Nello, burst into the barn and found Niccolosa astride Calandrino. Niccolosa fled. Tessa furiously attacked Calandrino, scratching his face and tearing his hair, calling him a ""besotted dotard"" and ""shitten cur.""
Calandrino, terrified, begged her to stop, claiming Niccolosa was the master's wife. Bruno and Buffalmacco entered, feigning to be drawn by the clamor. They appeased Tessa, blaming Calandrino for not warning his wife that women caused things to lose their virtue. They advised Calandrino to return to Florence and not come back. He did so, plagued by his wife's reproaches, his love extinguished.

**Story 6: Two Young Gentlemen and an Innkeeper**
Pamfilo tells of an innkeeper in Mugnone with a beautiful, unmarried daughter, Niccolosa, and a baby son. Pinuccio, a young gentleman, loved Niccolosa, and she him. They had met secretly. Pinuccio, wanting to spend a night with her, planned to lodge at her father's inn with his friend Adriano.
They arrived late, feigning to be returning from Romagna. The host, a friend, offered them his limited lodging. In the small bedchamber, there were three beds: one for Pinuccio and Adriano, one for Niccolosa, and one for the host and his wife (with the baby's cradle).
When all seemed asleep, Pinuccio went to Niccolosa's bed, where she joyfully received him. While they were together, a cat knocked something over. The hostess, waking, went to investigate. Meanwhile, Adriano, needing to relieve himself, moved the cradle to his bed, then returned to his bed.
The hostess, finding nothing, returned to the chamber. Not finding the cradle by her bed, she thought she was about to get into the guest's bed. She found the cradle, then entered the bed next to it, thinking it was her husband's. She lay with Adriano, who, not asleep, gladly received her.
Pinuccio, finished with Niccolosa, returned to his bed. Finding the cradle, he mistook the host's bed for Adriano's and lay down with the host. He awoke the host, boasting of his night with Niccolosa. The host, enraged, threatened him. Pinuccio, realizing his mistake, tried to feign dreaming.
The hostess, hearing her husband's scolding and Adriano's laughter, realized her own mistake. She quickly moved the cradle back to her daughter's bed and lay with her. She then called her husband, feigning to be awakened by the noise, and asked what was happening. She accused Pinuccio of dreaming and wandering in his sleep. Adriano, seeing her quick thinking, played along, telling Pinuccio to return to his own bed.
The host, convinced Pinuccio was dreaming, laughed. Pinuccio, feigning to wake, returned to Adriano's bed. The next day, the host mocked Pinuccio's ""dreams."" The young men departed, amused. Niccolosa believed Pinuccio had dreamt it all.

**Story 7: Talano di Molese**
Pampinea tells of Talano di Molese, a worthy man, and his beautiful but froward wife, Margarita. One night, Talano dreamt he saw Margarita walking in a wood near their country house. A great wolf attacked her, mangling her neck and face. In the morning, he warned her not to go out, especially not to the wood, recounting his dream.
Margarita, disdainful, believed he was trying to prevent her from meeting a trull. She went to the wood, determined to see what he was hiding. A great wolf suddenly attacked her, seizing her by the throat. She was rescued by shepherds, but her throat and face were so disfigured that she was ashamed to be seen. She bitterly regretted not heeding her husband's dream.

**Story 8: Biondello**
Lauretta tells of Ciacco, a gluttonous Florentine, who, lacking means, became a spunger, frequenting rich men's tables. Biondello, a dapper young man of the same trade, saw Ciacco one Lent morning buying two lampreys for Messer Vieri de' Cerchj. Ciacco asked what he was doing. Biondello replied that Messer Corso Donati had received finer lampreys and a sturgeon, but needed these two for a dinner he was giving. He invited Ciacco. Ciacco, expecting a feast, went to Messer Corso's house. He found only chickpeas, pickled tunny, and fried Arno fish. Ciacco realized Biondello had tricked him and resolved to take revenge.
A few days later, Ciacco met Biondello, who mocked him about Messer Corso's lampreys. Ciacco, without revealing his plan, said Biondello would know better in eight days. Ciacco then found a shrewd huckster and pointed out Messer Filippo Argenti, a choleric and humoursome gentleman. Ciacco gave the huckster a flask and instructed him to tell Messer Filippo that ""Sir Biondello sendeth me to you and prayeth you be pleased to rubify him this flask with your good red wine, for that he would fain make merry somedele with his minions."" He warned the huckster to flee if Filippo tried to grab him.
The huckster delivered the message. Messer Filippo, enraged, thought Biondello was mocking him. He tried to seize the huckster, who fled. Ciacco, having witnessed this, paid the huckster. He then found Biondello and told him Messer Filippo was looking for him. Biondello, unsuspecting, went to meet Filippo.
Messer Filippo, still fuming, saw Biondello and furiously attacked him, beating him severely, tearing his coif, and rolling him in the mud, demanding to know what he meant by ""rubify me"" and ""minions."" Biondello, confused, couldn't reply. Bystanders intervened, explaining Biondello's supposed message. Biondello, realizing Ciacco's trick, returned home bruised and sick. Later, Ciacco met him and asked about Filippo's wine. Biondello replied, ""Even as thou of Messer Corso's lampreys."" They made peace, and Biondello never affronted Ciacco again.

**Story 9: Two Young Men Seek Counsel of Solomon**
The queen tells of Melisso, a rich gentleman from Lajazzo, who sought Solomon's counsel on how to be loved, as he spent lavishly but found no one wished him well. On his journey, he met Giosefo, who sought counsel on how to amend his froward wife.
They reached Jerusalem and met Solomon. Melisso presented his case. Solomon simply replied, ""Love."" Giosefo then presented his case. Solomon replied, ""Get thee to Goosebridge."" Both, finding these answers unhelpful, returned home.
On their way, they saw a muleteer brutally beating a stubborn mule on a bridge until it crossed. Melisso and Giosefo, pitying the beast, advised gentler methods. The muleteer replied, ""You know your horses and I know my mule; leave me do with him."" He continued beating until the mule obeyed. Giosefo then asked the name of the bridge. It was ""Goosebridge."" Giosefo realized Solomon's counsel: he needed to beat his wife.
In Antioch, Giosefo's wife, as usual, ignored his instructions for supper. Giosefo, taking a stout stick, beat her severely until she promised to obey. The next morning, she prepared supper exactly as he wished. Melisso, seeing this, understood Solomon's advice: to be loved, one must love sincerely, not for show. Thus, the froward wife was corrected, and the young man, by loving, was loved.

**Story 10: Dom Gianni**
Dioneo tells of Dom Gianni di Barolo, a poor priest in Barletta, who traded merchandise with Pietro da Tresanti, a poor man with a buxom wife, Gemmata. Dom Gianni often stayed with Pietro, sleeping in the stable with his mare.
Dom Gianni once told Gemmata he could turn his mare into a beautiful wench to sleep with, and then back into a mare. Gemmata, believing him, told Pietro. She urged Pietro to learn the charm so he could turn her into a mare, use her for work, and then turn her back. Pietro, dull-witted, importuned Dom Gianni.
Dom Gianni, unable to dissuade him, agreed to teach him. He warned Pietro that the hardest part was ""putting on the tail"" and that he must not speak during the conjuration.
At dawn, Pietro and Gemmata, eager, arose. Dom Gianni, in his shirt, instructed Pietro to hold a light and remain silent. He stripped Gemmata naked, made her stand on all fours, and began touching her, saying, ""Be this a fine mare's head,"" ""Be this a fine mare's mane,"" ""Be these fine mare's legs and feet,"" and ""Be this a fine mare's chest"" (as his penis became erect). Finally, he thrust his penis into her vagina, saying, ""And be this a fine mare's tail.""
Pietro, seeing this, cried out, ""Ho there, Dom Gianni, I won't have a tail there, I won't have a tail there!"" Dom Gianni withdrew, saying Pietro had ruined the conjuration by speaking, and it could not be redone. Gemmata, furious, scolded Pietro for his folly. She lamented that he had ruined their chance to gain a mare. She dressed. Pietro continued his trade with an ass.

**Day the Ninth - Conclusion**
The company laughed at Dioneo's story. Pamfilo, his reign ending, crowned Lauretta as queen. Lauretta, accepting, announced the theme for the next day: ""OF THE TRICKS THAT ALL DAY LONG WOMEN PLAY MEN OR MEN WOMEN OR MEN ONE ANOTHER."" She allowed Dioneo to keep his privilege. All approved. They went barefoot in the clear water and enjoyed the garden. Dioneo and Fiammetta sang. After supper, Filomena sang a song about her new love and jealousy. The queen, noting the next day was Friday, declared it and Saturday would be days of rest and prayer, as before. They retired to rest.

**Day the Tenth**
**Introduction**
At dawn on Sunday, King Pamfilo and his company walked in the gardens, discussing their future life. After refreshments, dinner, and a nap, they reassembled by the fountain. Pamfilo bade Neifile begin the day's stories.

**Story 1: A Knight in the King's Service of Spain**
Neifile tells of Messer Ruggieri de' Figiovanni, a rich and high-spirited Florentine gentleman, who sought service with Alfonso, King of Spain, renowned for his valor. Ruggieri was graciously received and quickly gained fame for his deeds of arms. However, he noticed the King bestowed castles and baronies on unworthy individuals, while he, a man of worth, received nothing. Feeling his reputation diminished, he sought leave to depart.
The King granted his request and gave him a fine mule. He secretly sent a discreet servant to ride with Ruggieri, observe his words about the King, and then summon him back. As they rode, Ruggieri's mule refused to urinate when they stopped. Later, at a river, the mule urinated in the stream. Ruggieri exclaimed, ""God confound thee, beast, for that thou art made after the same fashion as the prince who gave thee to me!"" The servant noted this.
The next morning, the servant revealed the King's command to return. Ruggieri returned to court. The King asked why he likened him to his mule. Ruggieri frankly replied that the mule, like the King, gave where it should not and not where it should. The King explained that it was Ruggieri's misfortune, not his own fault, that he had not been rewarded. To prove this, he showed Ruggieri two locked coffers: one with his crown, sceptre, jewels, and all his treasures; the other full of earth. He bade Ruggieri choose one.
Ruggieri chose a coffer, which, when opened, was found to be full of earth. The King, laughing, said this proved Ruggieri's fortune was to blame. He then declared that, despite fortune, he would give Ruggieri the coffer of treasures, so he could return home and boast of his worth and the King's gifts. Ruggieri, grateful, returned to Tuscany with the treasure.

**Story 2: Ghino di Tacco**
Elisa tells of Ghino di Tacco, a cruel and famous robber, exiled from Siena, who seized Radicofani against the Church of Rome and plundered travelers. Pope Boniface VIII was in Rome. The Abbot of Cluny, a rich prelate, fell ill and was advised to go to the baths of Siena. He traveled with a large retinue, disregarding Ghino's reputation.
Ghino ambushed the Abbot and his company, capturing them all. He sent a messenger to the Abbot, inviting him to his castle. The Abbot, furious, refused. The messenger explained that excommunications were useless there, and the Abbot should comply. Seeing himself surrounded, the Abbot reluctantly went to the castle. Ghino lodged the Abbot alone in a dark, mean room, while his retinue was well accommodated.
Ghino visited the Abbot, asking his destination and purpose. The Abbot, now humbled, told him of his illness and journey to Siena. Ghino resolved to cure him without baths. He kept a fire in the room and, for several days, brought the Abbot only two slices of toasted bread and a beaker of wine each morning, claiming it was a remedy for his stomach.
The Abbot, hungry, ate and drank, but complained and demanded to see Ghino. Ghino, ignoring his demands, continued the regimen. When he saw the Abbot had eaten some dried beans (which Ghino had secretly left), he asked about his stomach. The Abbot replied he felt well, but longed to eat. Ghino then had a magnificent chamber prepared for the Abbot and hosted a grand banquet for him and his retinue.
After some days, Ghino revealed himself to the Abbot, explaining he was a gentleman forced into robbery by poverty and enemies. He offered the Abbot all his possessions, asking him to take what he wished, as a token of his cure. The Abbot, amazed by Ghino's generosity, embraced him, forgiving him and regretting his own past pride. He took only a few necessities and left the rest to Ghino.
The Abbot returned to Rome and told the Pope of his ""cure"" by a physician ""nearer than at the baths."" He then magnanimously requested the Pope pardon Ghino di Tacco and restore him to favor, arguing that Ghino's actions were due to misfortune, not evil. The Pope, a great soul, agreed. Ghino came to court, was made a knight of the Hospitallers, and became a loyal servant of the Church.

**Story 3: Mithridanes and Nathan**
Filostrato tells of Nathan, a noble and immensely rich man in Cattajo, who built a magnificent palace by a highway and offered lavish hospitality to all travelers. His fame spread. Mithridanes, a rich young man from a nearby country, grew envious and sought to surpass Nathan's generosity. He built a similar palace and offered even greater hospitality.
One day, an old woman, after receiving alms from Mithridanes, remarked on Nathan's greater generosity, saying she had entered Nathan's palace by all thirty-two gates and received alms each time without being recognized, while Mithridanes recognized her after only thirteen. Mithridanes, enraged by Nathan's superior fame, resolved to kill him.
He rode to Nathan's palace alone. He found Nathan walking unattended and, not recognizing him, asked where Nathan lived. Nathan, cheerfully, offered to guide him and ensured Mithridanes would not be recognized by anyone in the household. He lodged Mithridanes in a fine chamber and entertained him.
Mithridanes, still not knowing his host was Nathan, asked his identity. Nathan replied he was an ""unworthy servant"" who had grown old with Nathan, receiving little advancement. Mithridanes, emboldened, confessed his true identity and his intention to kill Nathan out of envy. Nathan, though disturbed, calmly advised him to find Nathan walking alone in a coppice nearby the next morning, where he could easily kill him. He also gave him directions for escape.
The next day, Mithridanes went to the coppice. He saw Nathan walking alone. He ran towards him, sword drawn, saying, ""Old man, thou art dead."" Nathan replied, ""Then have I merited it."" Mithridanes, recognizing Nathan's voice and face, was overwhelmed with shame. He threw down his sword, fell at Nathan's feet, and confessed his folly, acknowledging Nathan's supreme generosity.
Nathan raised him, embraced him, and pardoned him. He praised Mithridanes' noble ambition, saying that even emperors killed to gain fame. He then explained his willingness to die: he had lived a full life, and it was better to give his life as a gift than to have it taken by nature. He offered his life again. Mithridanes, deeply moved, refused.
Nathan then proposed they exchange identities: Mithridanes would live in Nathan's house as Nathan, and Nathan would live in Mithridanes's house as Mithridanes. Mithridanes declined, saying his actions would diminish Nathan's fame. They returned to Nathan's palace. Nathan entertained Mithridanes for days, encouraging his noble purpose. Mithridanes returned home, having learned he could never surpass Nathan's liberality.

**Story 4: Messer Gentile de' Carisendi**
Lauretta tells of Messer Gentile Carisendi, a noble Bolognese gentleman, who loved Madam Catalina, wife of Niccoluccio Caccianimico. Unrequited, he left for Modona as provost. Meanwhile, Catalina, pregnant, fell gravely ill and was pronounced dead by physicians. Her kinswomen, believing the child not fully formed, buried her in a church vault.
Messer Gentile, hearing of her death, resolved to steal a kiss from her dead body. He secretly rode to the church, opened the sepulchre, and lay beside her, kissing her. Overcome by desire, he touched her breast and felt a faint heartbeat. He realized she was alive. With his servant's help, he carefully removed her from the tomb and took her to his house in Bologna.
His mother, a discreet gentlewoman, revived Catalina with hot baths. Catalina awoke, confused, and saw Messer Gentile. He explained everything. She was distressed but thanked him, begging him not to dishonor her. Gentile promised to treat her as a dear sister but asked a favor: to stay with his mother until he returned from Modona, so he could present her to her husband in public. Catalina, grateful, agreed.
Soon after, Catalina gave birth to a healthy son. Gentile returned to Modona, completed his term, and planned a grand banquet in Bologna, inviting Niccoluccio Caccianimico. At the banquet, Gentile posed a question: if a master abandoned a sick servant, and a stranger revived him, did the first master have a right to reclaim the servant? Niccoluccio and all the guests agreed the servant justly belonged to the second master.
Gentile then called for Catalina, magnificently dressed, carrying her son. He presented her to the guests, asking if he had reason to hold her dear. Many recognized her but believed her dead. Niccoluccio, captivated, asked who she was. Gentile, after ensuring everyone's attention, revealed that she was the ""loyal and faithful servant"" he had found abandoned and restored to life. He recounted the entire story of her ""death"" and revival.
He then presented Catalina and her son to Niccoluccio, saying, ""Rise up, gossip; I do not restore thee thy wife, whom thy kinsfolk and hers cast away; nay, but I will well bestow on thee this lady my gossip, with this her little son, who I am assured, was begotten of thee and whom I held at baptism and named Gentile."" He swore she had lived chastely in his house. Niccoluccio, overjoyed, received his wife and son, thanking Gentile. The Bolognese were astonished. Catalina returned home, received with great rejoicing, and Gentile remained a friend to both families.

**Story 5: Madam Dianora**
Emilia tells of Madam Dianora, a noble and fair lady in Udine, Friuli, wife of Gilberto. Messer Ansaldo Gradense, a noble and valiant baron, loved her passionately. Dianora, tired of his importunities, set an impossible condition: she would grant him her love if he could provide a garden full of green grass, flowers, and trees in full leaf in January, as if it were May.
Ansaldo, though despairing, found a necromancer who, for a great sum, agreed to create such a garden. In January, when everything was covered in snow, the necromancer used his arts to create a beautiful garden. Ansaldo presented its fruits and flowers to Dianora, reminding her of her promise.
Dianora, seeing the miraculous garden, regretted her oath. Her husband, Gilberto, noticed her distress. She confessed everything. Gilberto, though initially angry, understood her pure intent. Fearing the necromancer, he magnanimously told her to go to Ansaldo and fulfill her promise, but to preserve her chastity if possible. If not, she should yield her body but not her soul.
Dianora, weeping, went to Ansaldo's house. Ansaldo, hearing her story and moved by Gilberto's generosity, declared he would not dishonor a man who had shown such compassion. He treated her as a sister and released her from her promise. Dianora, overjoyed, returned to Gilberto. A strong friendship formed between Gilberto and Ansaldo. The necromancer, seeing such generosity, refused his payment, saying he would also be liberal. Ansaldo, having his lustful love extinguished, retained an honorable affection for Dianora.

**Story 6: King Charles the Old**
Fiammetta tells of King Charles the Old (Charles I), who expelled the Ghibellines from Florence. Messer Neri degli Uberti, a Ghibelline, fled to Castellamare di Stabia, building a fine house and garden with a fishpond. King Charles, resting at Castellamare, heard of the garden's beauty. He sent word to Messer Neri that he would sup privately in his garden with four companions. Messer Neri, though an enemy, prepared a magnificent supper.
During supper, two beautiful young daughters of Messer Neri, Ginevra the Fair and Isotta the Blonde, entered the garden. They wore light linen garments and chaplets of periwinkle. One carried nets and a pole, the other a frying-pan, wood, trivet, oil, and a torch. They caught fish from the pond, and the servant cooked them. They served the fish to the King, who was captivated by their beauty and grace. After serving, they sang a sweet canzonet.
The King, ravished, felt a fervent desire for them, realizing he was in danger of falling in love. He asked Messer Neri who they were. Neri revealed they were his twin daughters. The King greatly commended them.
Later, unable to forget Ginevra's beauty, King Charles, feigning other reasons, frequently visited Messer Neri's garden. He confided his passion and his intent to abduct both daughters to Count Guy de Montfort. Count Guy, an honorable man, rebuked the King, reminding him of his age, his new kingdom, and the dishonor of such an act, especially against a host who had shown such faith. He reminded the King that Manfred's violence against women had opened the kingdom to him. He urged the King to conquer himself.
The King, stung by the truth, vowed to overcome his appetite. He returned to Naples and, to prevent dishonorable actions and reward Messer Neri, decided to marry the two girls, not as Neri's daughters, but as his own. He dowered them magnificently and gave Ginevra to Messer Maffeo da Palizzi and Isotta to Messer Guglielmo della Magna, both noble cavaliers. With great chagrin, he consigned them to their husbands and then went to Apulia, where he mortified his desire and lived free of such passion.

**Story 7: King Pedro of Arragon**
Pampinea tells of Lisa, daughter of Bernardo Puccini, a rich Florentine apothecary in Palermo. Lisa fell passionately in love with King Pedro of Arragon, whom she saw tilting at a festival. She despaired due to her low birth and his high status. Her unrequited love made her gravely ill.
Her father, offering to do anything, asked what she desired. She asked for Minuccio d'Arezzo, a skilled singer and player, to visit her. Minuccio, thinking she wanted music, played and sang. Lisa then privately confessed her secret love for King Pedro, her despair, and her wish to die, but only after the King knew of her love. She asked Minuccio to convey this.
Minuccio, moved, promised to help. He commissioned a poet, Mico da Siena, to write a canzonet expressing Lisa's love and longing for the King. Minuccio set it to a plaintive air. Three days later, he sang it to King Pedro, who was dining. The King, captivated, asked for whom the song was made. Minuccio privately revealed Lisa's story.
King Pedro, pleased by Lisa's noble spirit, promised to visit her that evening. Minuccio, overjoyed, brought the news to Lisa, who showed immediate signs of recovery.
Towards vespers, King Pedro, feigning diversion, visited Bernardo's house. He entered Lisa's chamber, took her hand, and encouraged her to recover. Lisa, feeling his touch, was in paradise and replied that her illness was due to her ""little strength"" to bear ""grievous burdens,"" but she would recover. The King understood her veiled words.
Later, the King, having consulted the Queen, returned to Bernardo's house with many barons. He called Lisa and declared that her great love had earned her great honor. He offered to marry her to a noble young gentleman, Perdicone, and promised to remain her ""knight"" forever, asking only for a kiss. Lisa, blushing, accepted, saying she would gladly obey him, even if it meant fire. She thanked him and the Queen.
The King married Lisa to Perdicone, bestowing on them rich fiefs and jewels. He then kissed Lisa on the brow, declaring himself her knight. Lisa and Perdicone lived happily. The King faithfully kept his promise, always wearing her favor in deeds of arms.

**Story 8: Sophronia, Gisippus, and Titus**
Fiammetta tells of Titus Quintius Fulvus, a Roman gentleman's son, sent to Athens to study. He lodged with Chremes, his father's friend, and studied with Chremes' son, Gisippus. They became inseparable friends. Chremes died.
Gisippus's kin urged him to marry. They found Sophronia, a beautiful and noble Athenian lady. Gisippus took Titus to see her. Titus, seeing Sophronia, fell passionately in love. He struggled with his love, torn between friendship and desire. He fell ill.
Gisippus, concerned, pressed Titus for the cause of his illness. Titus, weeping, confessed his love for Sophronia and his despair, resolving to die. Gisippus, though also attracted to Sophronia, valued Titus's life more. He rebuked Titus for hiding his pain and then magnanimously offered Sophronia to him. He argued that he could easily find another wife, but not another friend.
Titus, ashamed but drawn by love, finally accepted. Gisippus proposed that he would proceed with the wedding, bring Sophronia home as his wife, and then Titus would secretly lie with her. Later, they would reveal the truth. Titus agreed.
Gisippus married Sophronia. That night, Gisippus, in the dark, sent Titus to Sophronia's bed. Titus, after some hesitation, lay with her, asked her if she would be his wife (she, thinking him Gisippus, said yes), and placed a ring on her finger. They consummated their marriage.
Titus's father died, and he had to return to Rome. He and Gisippus decided to tell Sophronia the truth. She was enraged by Gisippus's deception and returned to her father, revealing she was Titus's wife. Sophronia's and Gisippus's families were furious, condemning Gisippus.
Titus, knowing the Greeks' tendency to clamor but then humble themselves, assembled both families in a temple. He argued that Sophronia's marriage was foreordained by the gods. He then compared himself to Gisippus: both young philosophers, but he was Roman (citizen of a free, world-ruling city, illustrious in arms and letters), while Gisippus was Athenian (of a tributary city). He was of nobler birth and richer. He argued that Gisippus had acted wisely in giving her to a better man. He also defended the secrecy, saying necessity often dictated such actions. He warned them that if they did not accept the marriage and treat Gisippus as a friend, he would take Gisippus to Rome and become their enemy, making them suffer Roman wrath.
The families, swayed by his reasoning and threats, agreed. Sophronia, making a virtue of necessity, accepted Titus and went with him to Rome.
Later, Gisippus, exiled and impoverished from Athens, came to Rome to seek Titus's help. Titus, passing by, did not recognize him in his wretched state. Gisippus, despairing, wandered to a deserted part of the city. He witnessed a thief murder another. Wishing to die without suicide, he remained there. The watch found him and, believing him the murderer, arrested him. Gisippus confessed, hoping for death.
Titus, by chance at the praetorium, recognized Gisippus. To save his friend, he falsely confessed to the murder. Gisippus, seeing Titus's sacrifice, then insisted he was the murderer. The true murderer, Publius Ambustus, moved by their friendship, confessed. Octavianus, hearing their stories, released all three.
Titus took Gisippus home, reproaching him for his diffidence. Sophronia received Gisippus as a brother. Titus restored Gisippus to wealth, shared all his possessions, and gave him his sister, Fulvia, in marriage. Gisippus and Fulvia, and Titus and Sophronia, lived long and happily in Rome, sharing one house and growing in friendship.

**Story 9: Saladin**
The king tells of Saladin, Soldan of Babylon, who, before a crusade, disguised himself as a merchant to observe Christian preparations. In Lombardy, he and his two officers met Messer Torello d'Istria, a gentleman of Pavia, who was going to his country seat. Torello, recognizing them as gentlemen, invited them to stay, subtly leading them to his house so they couldn't refuse. He entertained them magnificently.
Torello, impressed by his guests, sent a servant to his discreet wife in Pavia, instructing her to prepare a grand banquet for the next day. Saladin and his companions, speaking Latin, were greatly impressed by Torello's hospitality.
The next morning, Torello took his guests hawking, then led them to Pavia, not to an inn, but to his own house, where many noble citizens awaited them. Saladin, realizing the extent of Torello's hospitality, was deeply impressed. They were treated like royalty.
After dinner, Torello brought his beautiful wife and two young sons to meet them. She courteously greeted them and, after Torello left briefly, asked them about their journey. She then presented each of them with two magnificent gowns, three doublets, and linen breeches, claiming they were small gifts from a woman. Saladin and his companions, astonished, realized they had been recognized. They thanked her.
The next morning, Torello provided them with fine palfreys and horses. Saladin, deeply moved, realized the immense worth of Christian gentlemen. He departed, resolving to repay Torello's generosity.
Meanwhile, a Provençal gentleman named Messer Torello de Dignes died in the Christian camp. Due to the confusion of the crusade, many believed it was Messer Torello d'Istria. News reached Pavia that he was dead. His wife, Madam Adalieta, after months of mourning, was pressured by her family to remarry. She reluctantly agreed, on condition she could wait a year, a month, and a day from Torello's departure.
In Alexandria, Messer Torello (the Christian) learned from a traveler that the Genoese galley, on which he had sent letters to his uncle, had been shipwrecked, and all on board perished. Believing his letters lost and his wife remarried, he fell ill with despair, resolving to die. Saladin, learning the cause of his grief, promised to transport him to Pavia by magic before the deadline.
Saladin instructed a necromancer to put Torello to sleep and transport him on a magnificent bed with rich gifts (a crown, a carbuncle ring, a sword, pearls, gold basins of doubloons) to the church of San Pietro in Ciel d'Oro in Pavia.
Torello awoke in the church, surrounded by the gifts. The sacristan and monks, terrified, fled, believing him a ghost. Torello called out to the abbot, his uncle, who, after much fear, recognized him. The abbot told him his wife was to remarry that very morning.
Torello, dressed in Saracen attire, went with his uncle to the wedding feast. He sat opposite his wife, who, due to his beard and foreign dress, did not recognize him. Torello, to test her memory, sent her a cup of wine, asking her to drink from it according to a foreign custom. He secretly dropped the ring she had given him into the cup.
Madam Adalieta, drinking, found the ring, recognized it, and, realizing it was Torello, overturned the table and rushed to embrace him, crying, ""It is my lord, it is indeed Messer Torello!"" She refused to let go. Torello recounted his adventures. The new bridegroom, though mortified, accepted his fate. Adalieta put on Torello's ring and the Soldan's crown. They returned to Torello's house, where they celebrated with great joy. Torello shared his jewels with the new groom and others, and lived long and happily, continuing his hospitality.

**Story 10: The Marquess of Saluzzo**
Dioneo tells of Gualtieri, Marquess of Saluzzo, who, having no wife or children, spent his time hunting. His vassals urged him to marry. He reluctantly agreed but insisted on choosing his own wife, warning them they must honor whomever he chose. He had long admired Griselda, a poor peasant girl from a nearby village, and decided to marry her.
He arranged with her father, Giannucolo, and announced a magnificent wedding. On the wedding day, Gualtieri rode to the village with his company. He found Griselda returning from the spring. He dismounted, entered her poor house, and asked her father for her. He then asked Griselda if she would always obey him and never take offense at his actions. She agreed. He led her out, had her stripped naked, and clothed her in rich apparel, crowning her. He then married her in front of everyone and took her to his mansion.
Griselda, with her new clothes, also seemed to change her mind and manners. She became graceful, discreet, and so obedient and diligent that Gualtieri was delighted. His vassals, who had initially mocked his choice, now praised his wisdom.
Griselda bore a daughter. Gualtieri, to test her patience, pretended his vassals were discontent with her low birth and the child. Griselda calmly replied she would accept whatever pleased him. He then sent a servant to take the child, feigning to have her killed. Griselda, heartbroken but composed, handed over her daughter, asking only that she not be devoured by beasts. Gualtieri sent the child to a kinswoman in Bologna to be raised secretly.
Griselda bore a son. Gualtieri repeated the test, claiming his vassals would not accept a peasant's grandson as lord. Griselda again submitted patiently. He sent the son away, feigning his death, also to Bologna. The vassals condemned Gualtieri's cruelty but pitied Griselda, who always said she accepted her husband's will.
Years passed. Gualtieri, deciding on a final test, announced he could no longer endure Griselda and would seek a papal dispensation to divorce her and marry another. Many noblemen criticized him, but he remained firm. He produced forged papal letters and told Griselda she was dismissed, to return to her father with only the dowry she brought (nothing).
Griselda, containing her tears, replied she had always known her low estate. She returned his ring. She reminded him he took her naked and asked if she might keep one shift, as she brought no dowry. Gualtieri, with a stern face, agreed. She left his house in her shift, barefoot, and returned to her father, to the lamentation of all who saw her. Giannucolo, who had kept her old clothes, dressed her. She resumed her humble life.
Gualtieri then announced he was marrying a daughter of the Counts of Panago and made grand preparations. He sent for Griselda, ordering her to prepare the mansion for the new bride, inviting ladies, and receiving them as mistress of the house. Griselda, though heartbroken, obeyed. In her coarse clothes, she cleaned and decorated the palace, serving diligently.
Gualtieri had his two children (the girl now twelve, the boy six) brought from Bologna, presenting the girl as his new bride. All admired the girl's beauty. Griselda, too, praised her. Gualtieri, seeing Griselda's unwavering patience, revealed the truth. He embraced her, telling her these were their children, whom he had feigned to kill.
Griselda wept with joy, embracing her children. The ladies, overjoyed, reclothed her in magnificent attire. They celebrated for days. Gualtieri was deemed wise, though his trials were harsh. Griselda was praised for her wisdom. Giannucolo was elevated. Gualtieri and Griselda lived long and happily. Dioneo concludes that divine spirits can be found in poor cottages, and some in palaces are only fit to tend swine. He praises Griselda's patience.

**Day the Tenth - Conclusion**
Dioneo's story concluded, sparking much debate among the ladies. Pamfilo, seeing the sun setting, acknowledged their successful sojourn. He praised their decorum, concord, and fraternal familiarity. To avoid tediousness and prevent others from intruding, he proposed they return to Florence the next morning. All agreed. He gave instructions to the seneschal. After supper, Lauretta led a dance, and Fiammetta sang a song about her love and jealousy. The king dismissed them to rest.
The next day, they returned to Florence. The three young men took leave of the seven ladies at Santa Maria Novella, and the ladies returned to their homes.

**Conclusion of the Author**
The author addresses the noble damsels, stating he has completed his promised work. He thanks God and them. He anticipates objections to his ""overmuch license"" in the stories, particularly for modest women. He denies this, saying unseemly things can be expressed seemly. He argues that the nature of the stories required their content, and if some words are ""freer"" than hypocritical prudes like, it is no more forbidden than common speech or a painter depicting Adam and Eve naked. He emphasizes that the stories were told in a garden, for diversion, among mature individuals, not in church or schools.
He states that stories, like all things, can be harmful or profitable depending on the listener. Wine, though good for the healthy, harms the fevered. Fire is useful but can burn. Arms protect but can kill. Corrupt minds twist good words, but unseemly words cannot contaminate well-disposed minds. He asserts his stories are useful and seemly if read at the right times and by the right persons. Those who pray or make tarts can ignore them.
He acknowledges some might find stories ""better away"" or ""overlong."" He states he only wrote what was told and that no craftsman (except God) does everything perfectly. He reminds readers that he wrote for idle women, for passing time, not for students. He defends his use of ""quips and cranks"" as suitable for easing melancholy, like friars' sermons.
Finally, he addresses those who might call his tongue ""venomous"" for writing the truth about friars. He admits the world is constantly changing, and his tongue might be too. He concludes by thanking God and wishing the ladies peace and favor, hoping his stories have been profitable."
The Divine Comedy-Dante Alighieri,"The provided text, ""The Divine Comedy: The Vision of Hell, Purgatory, and Paradise,"" details a journey through the three realms of the afterlife. The plot unfolds as follows:

**HELL (OR THE INFERNO)**

**CANTO I**
The narrator, in the midway of his mortal life, finds himself lost in a ""gloomy wood,"" having strayed from the ""path direct."" He describes the forest as savage, wild, robust, and rough, its memory renewing his dismay. He reaches the foot of a mountain, which closes a valley that had filled him with dread. Looking up, he sees the mountain's broad shoulders already illuminated by the sun, which ""leads all wanderers safe."" This sight brings a brief respite from fear.
As he begins to ascend the steep, a ""panther, nimble, light, and cover'd with a speckled skin,"" appears and tries to block his path, making him consider turning back. The time is morning, and the sun is ascending with the stars that rose with it when ""Love divine first mov'd"" them, filling the narrator with joyous hope, despite the panther.
However, this joy is soon replaced by new dread when a ""lion"" appears, ""hunger-mad,"" making ""e’en the air fear-struck."" At its heels is a ""she-wolf,"" described as full of all wants and having made many lands desolate. The she-wolf overwhelms the narrator with such fear that he loses all hope of ascending the height and is gradually driven back down towards a ""lower space"" where ""the sun in silence rests.""
In this lower space, he discerns the form of a spirit whose voice seems faint from disuse. The narrator cries out, ""Have mercy on me! Spirit! or living man! what e’er thou be!""
The spirit replies that he is ""Now not man, man once I was,"" born of Lombard parents in Mantua, during the early reign of Julius. He lived in Rome under Augustus and was a bard who sang of ""Anchises’ upright son"" (Aeneas), who came from Troy. The spirit asks why the narrator is returning to perils instead of ascending the ""pleasant mount.""
The narrator, abashed, asks if he is ""that Virgil, that well-spring"" of eloquence, calling him ""Glory and light of all the tuneful train"" and his ""master and guide,"" from whom he derived his style. He then points to the she-wolf, begging Virgil to save him.
Virgil, seeing the narrator weeping, explains that he ""must needs another way pursue"" to escape the wilderness, as the she-wolf allows none to pass and is insatiable. She will continue to ""fasten"" on many animals until a ""greyhound"" comes to destroy her with pain. This greyhound will live ""by love, Wisdom, and virtue,"" and his land will be ""'twixt either Feltro."" He will bring safety to Italia and chase the she-wolf ""to hell at length.""
Virgil then devises a plan for the narrator's profit: he will guide the narrator through an ""eternal space"" where he will hear ""despairing shrieks"" and see ""Spirits of old tormented,"" who ""invoke a second death."" Next, they will see those who ""dwell Content in fire,"" hoping to reach the blessed. If the narrator wishes to ascend to those regions, a ""spirit worthier than I"" must lead him, as the ""Almighty King"" has decreed that Virgil, being a ""rebel to his law,"" cannot enter His city.
The narrator, wishing to escape ""this ill and worse,"" beseeches Virgil to lead him to ""Saint Peter’s gate"" and to those in ""dismal plight."" Virgil moves onward, and the narrator follows.

**CANTO II**
As day departs and shadows darken the air, releasing all animals from their toil, the narrator prepares himself for the ""conflict"" of ""sad pity, and that perilous road.""
He invokes the Muses and his ""high genius"" for aid. He then expresses his doubt to Virgil, questioning his own ""virtue"" for such a ""high enterprise."" He recalls that ""Silvius’ sire"" (Aeneas) entered among ""th’ immortal tribes"" while still in corruptible flesh, and that Heaven's Lord granted this favor due to the ""high effect"" that would issue from him (Rome and the Papacy). He also notes that ""the chosen vessel"" (Paul) traveled there to bring assurance of faith. But the narrator questions why he should presume to go, as he is ""not Aeneas I nor Paul"" and deems himself unworthy. He fears his venture will end in folly.
Virgil, perceiving the narrator's ""vile fear,"" explains his presence. He was among the spirits who ""rest suspended"" (in Limbo) when a ""dame, so blest and lovely,"" called him. Her eyes were brighter than the sun, and she spoke with a gentle, angelic voice. She introduced herself as Beatrice and explained that a friend (the narrator), ""not of my fortune but myself,"" had met great hindrance in the desert and turned back through fear. She dreaded he might be lost past help and had risen late for his relief, having heard of him ""in heaven."" She urged Virgil to assist him with his ""eloquent persuasive tongue"" and by all means for his deliverance, promising to tell her ""Master"" (God) of Virgil's praise.
The narrator, delighted by Beatrice's command, asks why she, who longs to return to her ""ample space"" in heaven, is not loath to descend to ""this centre here beneath.""
Beatrice explains that she fears only things from which evil may proceed, and she is ""so fram’d by God"" that human misery or the ""fierce fire"" of Hell do not touch her. She further reveals that in ""high heaven a blessed dame"" (Mary) mourns the narrator's hindrance so deeply that ""God’s stern judgment to her will inclines."" This dame called to Lucia, commending the narrator to her aid. Lucia, ""of all cruelty the foe,"" sped to Beatrice, who was seated with Rachel, and asked why Beatrice was not helping the man who loved her so much. Lucia described the narrator's ""pitiful wail"" and the ""death, which in the torrent flood... him struggling holds."" Beatrice then immediately came down from her ""blessed seat,"" trusting in Virgil's eloquence.
Virgil concludes by saying he came as Beatrice willed, saving the narrator from the beast that prevented his way up the mountain. He urges the narrator to cast off his fear, as ""three maids so blest"" (Mary, Lucia, Beatrice) plan his safety in heaven.
The narrator's ""fainting vigour"" is restored, and he feels ""kindly courage."" He thanks Beatrice and Virgil, stating his ""first purpose fully is resum’d."" He declares, ""Lead on: one only will is in us both. Thou art my guide, my master thou, and lord."" They then enter the ""deep and woody way.""

**CANTO III**
They arrive at a portal with a dim inscription: ""Through me you pass into the city of woe: Through me you pass into eternal pain: Through me among the people lost for aye. Justice the founder of my fabric mov’d: To rear me was the task of power divine, Supremest wisdom, and primeval love. Before me things create were none, save things Eternal, and eternal I endure. All hope abandon ye who enter here.""
The narrator finds these words to have ""Hard meaning."" Virgil, prepared, tells him to leave ""all distrust"" and extinguish ""vile fear,"" as they are about to see souls ""to misery doom’d, who intellectual good Have lost."" Virgil takes his hand and leads him into the ""secret place.""
Inside, sighs, lamentations, and loud moans resound through the starless air, making the narrator weep. He hears ""Various tongues, Horrible languages, outcries of woe, Accents of anger, voices deep and hoarse,"" mixed with the sound of hands smiting together, creating a tumult that whirls ""Like to the sand that in the whirlwind flies.""
The narrator asks what he is hearing and what race these woe-stricken people are. Virgil explains they are the ""wretched souls of those, who liv’d Without or praise or blame,"" mixed with ""ill band Of angels"" who were neither rebellious nor true to God, but ""for themselves Were only."" Heaven drove them out to preserve its lustre, and Hell does not receive them lest they ""glory thence with exultation vain.""
The narrator asks what aggrieves them. Virgil says they have ""No hope"" of death, and their ""blind life So meanly passes, that all other lots They envy."" The world has no fame of them, and ""mercy and justice scorn them both."" He advises the narrator to ""Speak not of them, but look, and pass them by.""
The narrator sees a rapidly whirling flag, followed by a long train of spirits, so many that he ""should ne’er Have thought, that death so many had despoil’d."" He recognizes one shade ""who to base fear Yielding, abjur’d his high estate."" He understands this is the tribe displeasing to both God and his foes. These ""wretches, who ne’er lived,"" are naked and stung by wasps and hornets, their blood and tears dropping to their feet, where ""disgustful worms"" gather it.
Looking further, he sees a throng on the shore of a great stream. He asks Virgil who they are and why they are so eager to cross. Virgil replies he will know ""soon as our steps arrive Beside the woeful tide of Acheron.""
The narrator, casting his eyes down in shame, abstains from speech until they reach the river. An old man, ""hoary white with eld,"" approaches in a bark, crying, ""Woe to you wicked spirits! hope not Ever to see the sky again. I come To take you to the other shore across, Into eternal darkness, there to dwell In fierce heat and in ice."" He then tells the narrator, a ""live spirit,"" to leave the dead. When the narrator does not leave, the old man says he must come to shore ""By other way, By other haven,"" carried by a ""nimbler boat."" Virgil tells the boatman, Charon, not to torment himself, as ""so ’t is will’d, Where will and power are one."" Charon, with ""shaggy cheeks"" and ""eyes glar’d wheeling flames,"" falls silent.
The faint, naked spirits change color and gnash their teeth, blaspheming God, their parents, mankind, the place, the time, and their origin. They all wailingly draw to the ""curs'd strand."" Charon, a ""demoniac form,"" collects them, striking those who linger with his oar. Like autumn leaves falling, Adam's ""evil brood"" cast themselves one by one from the shore into the boat.
As they cross the ""umber'd wave,"" another throng gathers on the near bank. Virgil explains that those who ""die subject to the wrath of God"" come here from every clime, eager to cross because ""heaven’s justice goads them on, that fear Is turn’d into desire."" He notes that no ""Good spirit"" has ever passed here, which explains Charon's complaint about the narrator.
As Virgil speaks, the ""gloomy region"" shakes terribly, chilling the narrator with fear. The earth emits a blast that shoots forth a ""vermilion flame,"" overwhelming the narrator's senses, and he drops ""as one with sudden slumber seiz’d.""

**CANTO IV**
A crash of heavy thunder breaks the narrator's deep slumber, rousing him forcefully. He looks around to discern his location, finding himself on the brink of the ""lamentable vale,"" a ""dread abyss"" filled with ""thund’rous sound Of plaints innumerable."" It is dark, deep, and thick with clouds, so he cannot see its bottom.
Virgil, looking pale, says, ""Now let us to the blind world there beneath Descend."" The narrator, seeing Virgil's altered hue, asks how he can proceed if his guide yields to dread. Virgil explains that the ""anguish of that race below With pity stains my cheek,"" which the narrator mistakes for fear. He urges haste, and they descend to the ""bounds Of the first circle, that surrounds th’ abyss.""
Here, only sighs are heard, not from torture, but from grief, felt by ""multitudes, many and vast, Of men, women, and infants."" Virgil explains that these spirits ""of sin Were blameless,"" but their merit ""profits not, since baptism was not theirs, The portal to thy faith."" If they lived before the Gospel, they ""serv’d not God aright."" Virgil states he is among them, ""lost"" for these defects, ""Only so far afflicted, that we live Desiring without hope.""
Hearing this, grief assails the narrator's heart, as he knows many souls of ""mighty worth"" are in this ""Limbo."" He asks if any, ""through his own or other’s merit,"" ever came forth from there to be blessed.
Virgil, understanding his speech, replies that he was new to that state when he saw a ""puissant one"" (Christ) arrive, ""with victorious trophy crown’d."" This figure drew forth ""the shade of our first parent,"" Abel, Noah, Moses, Abraham, David, Israel with his sire and sons, and Rachel, exalting them to bliss. Virgil assures the narrator that ""Before these... No spirit of human kind was ever sav’d.""
They continue through the ""wood"" of spirits. Not far from the summit, the narrator sees a flame shining through the darkened hemisphere. He discerns that a ""tribe in honour high"" possesses this place. He asks Virgil who these honored spirits are. Virgil explains that ""The renown of their great names That echoes through your world above, acquires Favour in heaven, which holds them thus advanc’d.""
A voice then cries, ""Honour the bard Sublime! his shade returns that left us late!"" Four mighty spirits, neither sorrowful nor glad, approach. Virgil points out Homer, who bears a keen falchion and leads the others as their lord. Next is Flaccus (Horace), excelling in satire; the third is Naso (Ovid); Lucan is the last. Virgil explains they honor him because they share the appellation of ""bard.""
The narrator sees this ""bright school"" united, with Homer soaring ""like an eagle."" After a short discourse, they turn to the narrator, beckoning him with kind salutation, which makes Virgil smile. They give the narrator ""greater honour still"" by making him ""of their tribe,"" so he is ""sixth amid so learn’d a band.""
They pass onward to a ""magnificent castle,"" seven times begirt with lofty walls and defended by a pleasant stream, which they cross as if on dry land. Through seven gates, the narrator enters with the sages into a mead of ""lively verdure fresh.""
There, a race of people moves their eyes majestically, bearing ""eminent authority,"" speaking seldom but with ""tuneful sweet"" words. They retire to an ""Open and bright and lofty"" place, where the narrator sees ""great spirits."" He identifies Electra, Hector, Anchises’ pious son (Aeneas), Caesar (all armed, with hawk’s eye), Camilla, Penthesilea, old King Latinus, his child Lavinia, Brutus (who chased Tarquin), Lucretia, Cato’s wife Marcia, Julia, Cornelia, and, ""sole apart retir’d, the Soldan fierce.""
Raising his brow, he spies ""the master of the sapient throng"" (Aristotle), seated amid philosophers, admired and revered by all. He sees Socrates, Plato (nearest to him), Democritus, Diogenes, Heraclitus, Empedocles, Anaxagoras, Thales, Zeno, Dioscorides, Orpheus, Linus, Tully, Seneca, Euclid, Ptolemy, Hippocrates, Galenus, and Averroes.
The six associates (the poets) part into two groups. Virgil leads the narrator away from that ""air serene"" into a ""climate ever vex’d with storms,"" reaching a place where ""no light shines.""

**CANTO V**
They descend to the second circle, which is smaller but contains ""so much more of grief."" Minos stands there, ""grinning with ghastly feature,"" strictly examining crimes. He gives sentence by wrapping his tail around himself to indicate the number of degrees a soul must descend. Souls confess their sins to him. A numerous throng always stands before him.
Minos sees the narrator approaching and cries, ""O thou! who to this residence of woe Approachest? Look how thou enter here; beware in whom Thou place thy trust; let not the entrance broad Deceive thee to thy harm."" Virgil silences Minos, stating that the narrator's way is ""by destiny appointed.""
The narrator now hears ""rueful wailings"" and ""many a plaining voice."" He enters a place where ""light was silent all."" A noise ""as of a sea in tempest torn By warring winds"" bellows. The ""stormy blast of hell With restless fury drives the spirits on Whirl’d round and dash’d amain."" When they reach a certain point, shrieks, lamentations, moans, and ""blasphemies ’gainst the good Power in heaven"" are heard.
The narrator understands that ""carnal sinners, in whom Reason by lust is sway’d,"" are condemned to this torment. Like starlings in winter, the ""tyrannous gust"" bears these evil souls ""On this side and on that, above, below,"" with no hope of rest or milder pang. Like cranes, spirits come ""loud wailing, hurried on By their dire doom."" The narrator asks who they are.
Virgil identifies the first as an empress ""O’er many tongues"" (Semiramis), who was so shameless in luxury that she made ""Liking be lawful by promulg’d decree, To clear the blame she had herself incurr’d."" Next is one who ""in amorous fury slew herself, And to Sicheus’ ashes broke her faith"" (Dido, though not named explicitly as the speaker). Then follows Cleopatra. The narrator also sees Helen, Achilles, Paris, and Tristan, and a thousand more ""whom love bereav’d of life.""
Hearing the names of these ""dames and knights of antique days,"" the narrator is ""o’erpower’d By pity."" He wishes to speak to ""those two together coming, Which seem so light before the wind."" Virgil tells him to wait until they are nearer, then entreat them ""by that love which carries them along.""
When the wind sways them toward them, the narrator calls out, ""O wearied spirits! come, and hold discourse With us, if by none else restrain’d."" Like doves invited by desire to their nest, two spirits issue from the troop (where Dido ranks) and speed through the ill air, moved by the narrator's cry.
One spirit speaks, calling the narrator a ""gracious creature and benign"" for visiting them in ""this element obscure."" She says if they owned the ""King of all"" as a friend, their prayer would arise for his peace, as he has pity on their plight. She offers to discourse on whatever pleases him, while the wind is mute. She states her birthplace is on the coast where the Po descends to the ocean.
She continues, explaining that ""Love, that in gentle heart is quickly learnt,"" entangled her companion by her ""fair form, from me Ta’en in such cruel sort, as grieves me still."" And ""Love, that denial takes from none belov’d,"" caught her with pleasing him so well that ""he yet deserts me not."" She concludes, ""Love brought us to one death: Caina waits The soul, who spilt our life.""
The narrator looks down, pondering ""by what sweet thoughts, what fond desire Must they at length to that ill pass have reach’d!"" He then addresses her, ""Francesca!"" expressing his grief and pity. He asks how, in the time of their ""sweet sighs,"" love granted that they knew their ""yet uncertain wishes.""
She replies that ""No greater grief than to remember days Of joy, when mis’ry is at hand!"" She then tells her tale, weeping. One day, for their delight, they read of Lancelot, ""How him love thrall’d."" They were alone, without suspicion. Often, the reading drew their eyes together, and their cheeks paled. But at ""one point Alone we fell."" When they read of the ""wished smile, rapturously kiss’d By one so deep in love,"" her companion (""who ne’er From me shall separate"") ""at once my lips All trembling kiss’d."" She concludes, ""The book and writer both Were love’s purveyors. In its leaves that day We read no more."" As she speaks, the other spirit wails so sorely that the narrator, ""heartstruck I through compassion fainting, seem’d not far From death, and like a corpse fell to the ground.""

**CANTO VI**
The narrator's senses revive from the pity and grief he felt for the ""kindred shades."" He immediately sees ""New torments, new tormented souls"" in the third circle. This circle is characterized by ""show’rs Ceaseless, accursed, heavy, and cold, unchang’d For ever, both in kind and in degree."" Large hail, discolored water, and sleet stream down through the dark air, making the land stink.
Cerberus, a ""cruel monster, fierce and strange,"" barks through his ""wide threefold throat"" over the immersed multitude. His eyes glare crimson, his beard is black and unctuous, his belly large, and his clawed hands tear and flay the spirits, dismembering them. The spirits howl like curs under the rain, often rolling around to shield themselves.
When Cerberus sees them, he opens his jaws, showing his fangs, and trembles. Virgil, expanding his palms, fills them with earth and casts it into Cerberus's ""ravenous maw."" Just as a dog bays for food and then quiets to swallow a morsel, Cerberus's ""loathsome cheeks"" drop, and he ceases his thundering.
They pass over the prostrate shades, whose emptiness seems to have substance. All lie extended except one, who suddenly raises himself to sit as they pass. He cries, ""O thou! who through the infernal shades art led, Own, if again thou know’st me. Thou wast fram’d Or ere my frame was broken.""
The narrator replies that the anguish he endures might have altered his form beyond recognition and asks who he is. The spirit answers that the narrator's city, ""heap’d with envy to the brim,"" held him in ""brighter days."" Citizens called him Ciacco. He is worn with fatigue under the rain for the sin of gluttony, and he is not the only one.
The narrator, grieved, asks Ciacco what will befall the citizens of the ""divided city,"" if any just person lives there, and the cause of its discord. Ciacco prophesies that after long striving, they will come to blood, and one party will chase the other out. Then, within ""Three solar circles,"" the wild party will fall, and the other will rise by ""borrowed force of one, who under shore Now rests."" This party will oppress the other for a long time. He states there are only ""two just"" individuals, but they are neglected. ""Av’rice, envy, pride, Three fatal sparks, have set the hearts of all On fire.""
The narrator asks for more, about Farinata, Tegghiaio, Giacopo, Arrigo, Mosca, and others who ""bent Their minds on working good,"" asking where they reside and if they are in heaven or hell. Ciacco replies that ""These are yet blacker spirits. Various crimes Have sunk them deeper in the dark abyss. If thou so far descendest, thou mayst see them."" He then asks the narrator to mention him when he returns to the ""pleasant world."" Ciacco then turns his eyes askance, eyes the narrator, bends his head, and falls among his blind companions.
Virgil explains that Ciacco will not leave his bed ""Ere the last angel-trumpet blow."" Then, the ""Power Adverse to these"" will come in glory, and each spirit will repair to his tomb, resume his flesh and form, and hear the ""eternal doom.""
They pass through the foul mixture of spirits and rain with slow steps. The narrator asks if the tortures will increase, mitigate, or remain the same after the ""great sentence."" Virgil replies that as things grow ""to more perfection,"" they feel ""more sensibly both good and pain."" Though this accursed race will never reach true perfection, they will ""approach it"" closer then.
They journey circuitously, conversing more than related, until they reach the point where steps lead below, finding Plutus, the ""great foe.""

**CANTO VII**
Plutus exclaims loudly, ""Ah me! O Satan! Satan!"" Virgil comforts the narrator, assuring him Plutus has no power to hinder their descent. Turning to Plutus, Virgil cries, ""Peace! Curs'd wolf! thy fury inward on thyself Prey, and consume thee! Through the dark profound Not without cause he passes. So 't is will'd On high, there where the great Archangel pour'd Heav'n's vengeance on the first adulterer proud."" Plutus drops to the ground like a sail when the mast splits.
They descend to the fourth steep ledge, reaching a dismal shore that ""Hems in of all the woe Of all the universe."" The narrator laments, ""Almighty Justice! in what store thou heap'st New pains, new troubles... Wherefore doth fault of ours bring us to this?""
He sees a wretched race, more numerous than elsewhere, leading a dance like billows breaking against each other in Charybdis. From both sides, they roll weights with their breasts, then smite together, rolling back and exclaiming, ""Why holdest thou so fast?"" and ""And why castest thou away?"" They repeat this ""despiteful song"" around the horrid circle, meeting again in the middle.
The narrator, stung with grief, asks Virgil what race this is and if those with ""heads are shorn"" on their left were ""sep’rate to the church."" Virgil replies that all these spirits ""In their first life... In mind were so distorted, that they made, According to due measure, of their wealth, No use."" Their words reveal this. He clarifies that those ""separate to the church"" are Popes and Cardinals, ""o’er whom Av’rice dominion absolute maintains.""
The narrator asks if he will recognize any of them. Virgil says it is a ""Vain thought"" because their ""ignoble life"" now makes them dark and ""indiscernible."" They will forever meet in this ""rude shock,"" some rising from the tomb with ""clenched grasp,"" others with ""close-shaven locks."" Their ill-giving and ill-keeping deprived them of the beautiful world and set them at this strife. Virgil points out how brief and vain are ""The goods committed into fortune’s hands,"" for which humanity struggles, and that ""Not all the gold... Might purchase rest for one"" of these souls.
The narrator then asks Virgil about ""this fortune, that thou speak’st of, what it is, Whose talons grasp the blessings of the world?""
Virgil explains that He ""whose transcendent wisdom passes all,"" created the heavens and gave them ""ruling powers"" to guide them, distributing light equally. Similarly, He ordained a ""guiding hand And general minister"" (Fortune) to rule over the world's ""bright images,"" changing ""empty vantages of life From race to race, from one to other’s blood,"" beyond human care. Thus, one nation rises, another languishes, as Fortune's will decrees, concealed from humans like a serpent in the grass. Human wisdom cannot avail against her. She plans, judges, and reigns without intermission, made swift by necessity, as many claim succession in her favors. She is ""execrated e’en by those, whose debt To her is rather praise,"" who wrongly blame her, but she is blessed and exults in her bliss among the ""other primal beings.""
Virgil urges them to pass on to ""heavier woe,"" as the stars are falling, forbidding long tarrying. They cross the circle to the next steep, arriving at a well that boils and pours into a foss. The water is ""Far murkier than sablest grain."" They journey beside the inky waters, entering beneath by a different track. The dismal stream expands into a lake called Stygian.
The narrator gazes intently and sees a ""miry tribe, all naked, and with looks Betok’ning rage,"" sunk in the marsh. They strike each other with hands, heads, breasts, feet, and tear each other piecemeal with their fangs. Virgil explains these are the souls of those ""whom anger overcame."" He adds that underneath the water dwells a multitude whose sighs make the surface heave. Fixed in the slime, they say, ""Sad once were we In the sweet air made gladsome by the sun, Carrying a foul and lazy mist within: Now in these murky settlings are we sad,"" gurgling this ""dolorous strain"" without distinct words.
They compass their route between the dry embankment and the pool's core, looking down at those who gulp its muddy lees, stopping only at a tower's low base.

**CANTO VIII**
Before reaching the tower's base, they see two cressets hung on its height, and another light answers from afar. The narrator asks Virgil what this means. Virgil replies that they will soon see ""what next awaits us"" on the ""filthy waters,"" if the marsh fog does not conceal it.
A small bark then comes swiftly through the waves, steered by one ferryman, who cries, ""Art thou arriv’d, fell spirit?"" Virgil replies, ""Phlegyas, Phlegyas, This time thou criest in vain; No longer shalt thou have us, but while o’er The slimy pool we pass."" Phlegyas pines in fierce ire.
Virgil steps into the skiff, and the narrator follows, sitting close beside him. The vessel seems freighted only after the narrator enters. The ancient prow cuts the waves more deeply than usual.
As they cross the ""dead channel,"" one spirit, drenched in mire, asks the narrator, ""Who art thou, that thou comest ere thine hour?"" The narrator replies he comes but does not tarry, and asks who the spirit is. The spirit says he is ""One, as thou seest, who mourn."" The narrator recognizes him, ""E’en thus in filth disguis’d,"" and tells him to remain in mourning. The spirit stretches his hands toward the bark, but Virgil thrusts him back, crying, ""Away! down there, To the other dogs!""
Virgil then embraces the narrator, kissing his cheek, and praises him for his ""justly disdainful"" soul. He explains that the spirit was ""noted"" for arrogance in the world and has no virtue to lend lustre to his memory. He adds that many who are ""mighty kings"" above will wallow in the mire here.
The narrator wishes to see the spirit ""Whelm’d in these dregs"" before they leave the lake. Virgil assures him this wish will be satisfied. Scarcely had Virgil spoken when the ""miry tribes Set on him with such violence,"" crying ""To Filippo Argenti!"" The ""moody Florentine"" turns his avenging fangs on himself. They leave him there.
Suddenly, a sound of lamentation strikes the narrator's ear. Virgil tells him, ""Now Draws near the city, that of Dis is nam’d, With its grave denizens, a mighty throng."" The narrator sees ""minarets"" in the valley, gleaming vermilion as if from fire. Virgil explains that ""Eternal fire, That inward burns, shows them with ruddy flame Illum’d.""
They reach deep fosses that moat this comfortless region. The walls appear made of iron. After a wide circuit, they reach a place where the mariner (Phlegyas) cries, ""Go forth! The entrance is here!"" On the gates, the narrator sees ""More than a thousand"" spirits ""hurl’d"" from heaven long ago. With ireful gestures, they ask, ""Who is this... that without death first felt, goes through The regions of the dead?""
Virgil signals for a secret parley. Their anger abating, they say, ""Come thou alone; and let him go Who hath so hardily enter’d this realm. Alone return he by his witless way; If well he know it, let him prove. For thee, Here shalt thou tarry, who through clime so dark Hast been his escort."" The narrator is terrified, believing he will never return.
He cries to Virgil, his ""lov’d guide,"" not to desert him, and if they cannot proceed, to return. Virgil replies not to fear, as none can disappoint their passage, which is ""by such high Authority permitted."" He tells the narrator to wait and comfort his spirit with hope, assuring him he will not be left.
Virgil departs. The narrator remains, hesitating. He cannot hear the terms of the parley, but the adversaries confer not long, then ""fled within."" They close the gates on Virgil, who returns with ""tardy steps,"" eyes bent on the ground, confidence erased, sighing, ""Who hath denied me these abodes of woe?"" He then tells the narrator not to fear his anger, as he will vanquish them. He explains their insolence is not new, displayed earlier at a less secret gate (which is still without bolt, and on whose arch the narrator saw the ""deadly scroll""). He adds that ""even now On this side of its entrance, down the steep, Passing the circles, unescorted, comes One whose strong might can open us this land.""

**CANTO IX**
The narrator's fear, which had made his cheeks pale, now affects Virgil, whose face had just worn a look of anger. Virgil stands attentive, listening, as his eye cannot penetrate the ""sable air, And the thick-gath’ring cloud."" He begins, ""It yet behooves We win this fight—if not—Such aid to us is offer’d.—Oh, how long Me seems it, ere the promis’d help arrive!"" The narrator notes that Virgil's words seem to cloak their beginning, not agreeing. His fear intensifies, interpreting the ""mutilated speech"" as worse than intended.
The narrator asks if anyone ever descends to this ""rueful concave’s extreme depth"" from the first degree (Limbo), where the pain is ""deprivation merely of sweet hope."" Virgil replies that it ""Rarely"" happens, but he once came here, ""conjured by fell Erictho, sorceress,"" who compelled shades back to their bodies. She made him enter these walls to draw forth a spirit from ""Judas’ circle,"" the ""Lowest place... obscurest, and remov’d Farthest from heav’n’s all-circling orb."" He knows the road well and assures the narrator. He adds that the ""noisome stench"" from the lake surrounds the ""city of grief,"" which they cannot enter ""without rage.""
Virgil adds more, but the narrator cannot recall it, as his eye is drawn to the ""lofty tower,"" where he suddenly sees ""three hellish furies stain’d with blood."" They seem feminine in limb and motion, with ""greenest hydras twisting roll’d Their volumes"" around them, and ""adders and cerastes crept Instead of hair.""
Virgil, knowing these ""miserable hags"" who serve the ""queen of endless woe,"" points them out: Megaera on the left, Alecto (who wails) on the right, and Tisiphone in the middle. They tear their breasts with claws, smite themselves with palms, and raise such a clamor that the narrator clings to Virgil. They cry out, ""Hasten Medusa: so to adamant Him shall we change; E’en when by Theseus’ might assail’d, we took No ill revenge."" Virgil turns the narrator around and hides his face with his own hands, warning that if the ""Gorgon dire Be shown,"" his return ""Upwards would be for ever lost.""
A loud-crashing, terrible sound comes over the perturbed waves, making both shores tremble, like an impetuous wind. Virgil loosens the narrator's eyes and tells him to look along the ""ancient foam, There, thickest where the smoke ascends."" Like frogs fleeing a serpent, ""more than a thousand spirits Destroy’d"" flee before one who passes with ""unwet feet the Stygian sound."" This figure, removing the gross air from his face, often stretches forth his left hand, seeming wearied only by that annoyance. The narrator perceives he is ""sent from heav’n"" and turns to Virgil, who signals him to stand quiet and bow. The figure, full of ""noble anger,"" comes to the gate and touches it with his wand, causing it to fly open without impediment.
Standing on the ""horrid grunsel,"" the figure addresses the ""Outcasts of heav’n! O abject race and scorn’d!"" asking why such insolence lodges in them and why they kick against God's will. He reminds them of their Cerberus, whose throat and maw still bear the marks of being ""peel’d of their hair.""
He then turns back without speaking to them, appearing beset by other cares. They move toward the territory, secure after the ""hallow’d words."" They enter unopposed, and the narrator, eager to learn, looks around, seeing ""wide-stretching space Replete with bitter pain and torment ill.""
The place is thick with sepulchres, like those at Arles or Pola, but more horrible, for ""midst the graves were scattered flames, Wherewith intensely all throughout they burn’d."" Their lids hang suspended, and ""lamentable moans"" issue from beneath.
The narrator asks Virgil who is interred in these vaults. Virgil replies, ""The arch-heretics are here, accompanied By every sect their followers."" He adds that more tombs are freighted than the narrator believes, with ""Like with like is buried,"" and monuments differ in ""degrees of heat."" Virgil then turns to the right, and they pass between the afflicted and the high ramparts.

**CANTO X**
They proceed by a secret pathway between the walls and the tormented souls, Virgil first, the narrator close behind. The narrator asks if those in the sepulchres can be seen, as their lids are raised and none keep watch. Virgil replies that they will be closed when the spirits return from Josaphat with their bodies. He explains that ""Epicurus all his followers, Who with the body make the spirit die,"" occupy this part.
Suddenly, a voice from a vault cries, ""O Tuscan! thou who through the city of fire Alive art passing, so discreet of speech! Here please thee stay awhile. Thy utterance Declares the place of thy nativity To be that noble land, with which perchance I too severely dealt."" The narrator, in fear, draws closer to Virgil, who tells him to turn and behold Farinata, who has ""Uplifted"" himself, exposed ""from his girdle upwards."" The narrator's gaze is fixed on Farinata, who seems to hold hell in scorn. Virgil pushes the narrator toward him, warning him to speak clearly.
Farinata eyes the narrator, then disdainfully asks, ""Say, what ancestors were thine?"" The narrator reveals his lineage. Farinata, uplifting his brow, cries that they were ""Fiercely... Adverse to me, my party, and the blood From whence I sprang: twice therefore I abroad Scatter’d them."" The narrator replies that though driven out, his ancestors ""each time From all parts... return’d; an art Which yours have shown, they are not skill’d to learn.""
Then, from the unclosed jaw of the same tomb, another shade rises, ""high as the chin,"" leaning on its raised knees. It looks around for others with the narrator, then, seeing its ""fond imagination quench’d,"" speaks with tears: ""If thou through this blind prison go’st, Led by thy lofty genius and profound, Where is my son? and wherefore not with thee?""
The narrator replies that he does not come by himself, but is conducted by Virgil, ""whom perchance Guido thy son Had in contempt."" The narrator's answer reveals the spirit's name. The spirit exclaims, ""How! said’st thou he HAD? No longer lives he? Strikes not on his eye The blessed daylight?"" The narrator's delay in replying causes the spirit to fall back supine, and he appears no more.
Meanwhile, Farinata, ""great of soul,"" does not change his stern countenance. He continues, ""And if... They in this art... small skill have shown, That doth torment me more e’en than this bed."" He prophesies that the narrator will know the ""full weight of that art"" (exile) before ""fifty times"" the queen of this realm (the moon) is relumed. He asks why the people are so ""fell"" against his kin.
The narrator replies that the ""slaughter and great havoc"" that stained Arbia's flood with crimson are the cause of such prayers in their ""hallow’d dome."" Farinata sighs, shakes his head, and resumes, stating that in that affray, he ""stood not singly,"" but ""singly there I stood, when by consent Of all, Florence had to the ground been raz’d, The one who openly forbad the deed.""
The narrator adjures him to solve a knot in his mind: ""Ye seem to view beforehand, that which time Leads with him, of the present uninform’d."" Farinata answers, ""We view, as one who hath an evil sight, Plainly, objects far remote: So much of his large spendour yet imparts The Almighty Ruler; but when they approach Or actually exist, our intellect Then wholly fails, nor of your human state Except what others bring us know we aught."" He concludes that their knowledge will expire when ""on futurity the portals close.""
Conscious of his fault, the narrator, smitten by remorse, tells Farinata to inform the fallen spirit that his offspring ""Is to the living join’d,"" and that his silence was due to his thoughts being intent on the error Virgil had solved.
Virgil summons the narrator back. The narrator eagerly asks Farinata who else partakes his lot. Farinata replies, ""More than a thousand with me here are laid Within is Frederick, second of that name, And the Lord Cardinal, and of the rest I speak not."" He then withdraws.
The narrator, reverting to Virgil, ruminates on the words ""betokening me such ill."" Virgil, moving onward, asks about his ""amaze."" The narrator satisfies the inquiry, and Virgil enjoins him to store what he has heard, adding, ""When thou shalt stand before her gracious beam, Whose bright eye all surveys, she of thy life The future tenour will to thee unfold.""
Virgil then turns his feet to the left, and they leave the wall, going by a path that strikes to a valley, which ""e’en thus high exhal’d its noisome steam.""

**CANTO XI**
They arrive at the ""utmost verge of a high bank, By craggy rocks environ’d round,"" where ""woes beneath more cruel yet were stow’d."" To avoid the ""horrible excess Of fetid exhalation"" from the abyss, they stand retired behind the lid of a great monument. The narrator sees a scroll on it: ""I have in charge Pope Anastasius, whom Photinus drew From the right path.""
Virgil explains they must delay their descent so their senses can accustom to the ""dire breath."" The narrator asks for ""some compensation"" so the time is not lost. Virgil replies that his thoughts tend to the narrator's wishes. He then explains that within these rocks are ""three close circles in gradation plac’d,"" like those they just left, all full of accursed spirits. He will explain how and why they are there, so the sight alone will suffice later.
He states that ""Of all malicious act abhorr’d in heaven, The end is injury; and all such end Either by force or fraud works other’s woe."" Fraud is more displeasing to God because it is ""of man peculiar evil,"" so the fraudulent endure ""Severer pang."" The violent occupy the first circle, framed in three rounds because force can be offered to ""God, his neighbour, and himself.""
Violent death and painful wounds inflicted on a neighbor, or substance wasted by devastation, pillage, and flames, are punished in the first round. Slayers, those who strike in malice, plunderers, and robbers are there in different herds.
Man can do violence to himself and his possessions. Those who deprive themselves of life and light, waste their talent in ""reckless lavishment,"" and sorrow where they should joy, are in the second round.
Force can be offered to God by denying and blaspheming his power, and contemning nature's law. The ""inmost round"" marks Sodom and Cahors, and those who speak contemptuously of God in their hearts.
Fraud can be employed on one whose trust is won, or on another who withholds strict confidence. The latter breaks ""the bond of love which Nature makes."" In the second circle (of fraud), ""Dissimulation, witchcraft, flatteries, Theft, falsehood, simony, all who seduce To lust, or set their honesty at pawn, With such vile scum as these"" have their nest. The other way (breaking special faith) forgets both nature's general love and the added special faith. In the ""lesser circle, Point of the universe, dread seat of Dis,"" the traitor is ""eternally consum’d.""
The narrator praises Virgil's clear discourse. He then asks why those in the ""dull, fat pool"" (the angry), whom the rain beats (the gluttonous), or whom the tempest drives (the lustful), are not punished within the ""city fire-illum’d"" if God's wrath is on them, or why they are condemned if it is not.
Virgil replies, asking why his mind wanders. He reminds the narrator of ""thy ethic page"" (Aristotle) which describes three dispositions adverse to Heaven's will: ""Incont’nence, malice, and mad brutishness,"" and how incontinence ""the least offends God, and least guilt incurs."" If he notes this judgment and remembers who those ""without these walls to vain repentance doom’d"" are, he will discern why they are placed apart and why ""Justice divine on them its vengeance down"" pours less wreakful.
The narrator calls Virgil ""O Sun! who healest all imperfect sight,"" saying he is content. He asks Virgil to explain how ""usury Offends celestial Goodness."" Virgil replies that philosophy clearly shows how ""imitative nature takes her course From the celestial mind and from its art."" He refers to the ""Stagyrite"" (Aristotle), stating that one will discover that ""your art on her Obsequious follows, as the learner treads In his instructor’s step, so that your art Deserves the name of second in descent From God."" Both nature and art were the ""right source of life and excellence To human kind."" But the usurer walks ""in another path,"" setting nature and its follower at nought, placing his hope elsewhere.
Virgil urges them to follow his steps, as ""the Pisces play with undulating glance Along the horizon, and the Wain lies all O’er the north-west,"" indicating it is time to move down the ""steep passage down the rocky height.""

**CANTO XII**
The place where they descend the precipice is ""rough as Alp,"" and on its verge lies an object ""as every eye would shun."" It is a ruin, like one struck by a river or earthquake, so shivered that it provides passage. Stretched at the point of the ridge is ""The infamy of Crete, detested brood Of the feign’d heifer"" (the Minotaur), gnawing itself in rage.
Virgil exclaims to the Minotaur, ""Perchance thou deem’st The King of Athens here, who, in the world Above, thy death contriv’d. Monster! avaunt! He comes not tutor’d by thy sister’s art, But to behold your torments is he come."" The Minotaur plunges like a struck bull. Virgil tells the narrator to run to the passage while the monster storms.
They descend through the dilapidated crags, which often move under the narrator's feet, unused to such weight. The narrator ponders, and Virgil explains that when he first descended to ""nether hell,"" this rock had not fallen. But ""not long ere He arrived, Who carried off from Dis the mighty spoil Of the highest circle,"" a trembling seized the deep concave, making Virgil think the ""universe was thrill’d with love,"" and then this old rock toppled down.
Virgil then tells the narrator to fix his eyes beneath, as ""the river of blood Approaches, in the which all those are steep’d, Who have by violence injur’d."" The narrator laments ""O blind lust! O foolish wrath!"" He sees an ""ample foss,"" bent in a bow, circling the plain. Between it and the rampart, Centaurs run, armed with keen arrows, as they were wont to hunt on earth.
Seeing them descend, the Centaurs stop. Three speed forth with bows. One cries, ""Say to what pain ye come Condemn’d, who down this steep have journied? Speak From whence ye stand, or else the bow I draw."" Virgil replies that their answer will be made to Chiron when they are nearer, calling the Centaur ""quick and rash.""
Virgil touches the narrator and identifies Nessus, who died for Deianira and avenged his fate. In the middle, looking down on his breast, is ""the great Chiron who Achilles nurs’d."" The other is Pholus, ""prone to wrath."" Thousands of Centaurs go around the foss, aiming shafts at any spirit that dares emerge from the blood more than its guilt allows.
They approach the Centaurs. Chiron takes an arrow, pushes back his shaggy beard, and exposes his mouth, exclaiming to his fellows, ""Are ye aware, that he who comes behind Moves what he touches? The feet of the dead Are not so wont."" Virgil, standing near Chiron's breast where the two natures join, replies that the narrator is alive and must be shown the gloomy vale by him, induced by ""strict necessity, not by delight."" He explains that a lady from heaven (Beatrice) consigned this office to his care, and he is ""no robber, no dark spirit."" He asks Chiron to grant one of his band to guide them to the ford and convey the narrator across on his back, as he is not a spirit who can walk the air.
Chiron turns to Nessus and tells him to return and be their guide, commanding any other troop they cross to keep aloof. They move on with Nessus beside them, along the border of the ""crimson-seething flood,"" from which loud shrieks arise.
The narrator sees some spirits immersed up to their brow. Nessus identifies them as ""tyrants, who were given To blood and rapine,"" wailing for their ""merciless wrongs."" He points out Alexander and Dionysius, who wrought woe for Sicily. The one with ""jetty clust’ring"" hair is Azzolino; the one with ""flaxen locks"" is Obizzo of Este, destroyed by his step-son. The narrator turns to Virgil, who tells him to let Nessus be his first leader.
Nessus pauses near some spirits at the throat in the wave and points out a spirit apart, exclaiming, ""He in God’s bosom smote the heart, Which yet is honour’d on the bank of Thames.""
Next, the narrator sees a race who hold their heads and busts above the stream, recognizing many faces. The blood becomes shallower, eventually only imbruing their feet, where their passage lies.
Nessus explains that as the boiling wave diminishes on this side, it sinks lower on the other, until it reunites where ""tyranny to mourn"" is the lot. There, ""Heav’n’s stern justice lays chastising hand On Attila, who was the scourge of earth, On Sextus, and on Pyrrhus,"" extracting tears from the Rinieri (of Corneto) and Pazzo (who filled ways with violence and war). Nessus then turns and repasses the ford alone.

**CANTO XIII**
Before Nessus reaches the other bank, they enter a trackless forest. The foliage is dusky, not verdant; the boughs are gnarled and thick, not light; there are thorns instead of fruits, filled with venom. The narrator notes that the brakes where animals that hate cultivated fields abide are less sharp and intricate. Here, ""brute Harpies make their nest,"" the same who drove the Trojan band from the Strophades. They have broad wings, human necks and countenances, keen talons, and huge bellies fledged with wings, and they sit and wail in this ""drear mystic wood.""
Virgil warns the narrator that he is in the ""second round"" until he reaches the ""horrid sand,"" and tells him to look around for things that would discredit his speech. The narrator hears sad plaints but sees no one. Virgil, believing the narrator thinks the voices come from concealed thickets, tells him to ""lop off A single twig from one of those ill plants"" to make his thought vanish.
The narrator stretches his hand, plucks a branch from a ""great wilding,"" and the trunk exclaims, ""Why pluck’st thou me?"" As dark blood trickles, it adds, ""Wherefore tear’st me thus? Is there no touch of mercy in thy breast? Men once were we, that now are rooted here. Thy hand might well have spar’d us, had we been The souls of serpents."" Words and blood burst from the broken splinter like a green brand hissing in the wind.
The narrator drops the bough, terror-stricken. Virgil apologizes to the ""injur’d spirit,"" explaining that the narrator would not have touched him if he had believed what Virgil had only described in verse. Virgil admits he prompted the act because it ""surpass’d belief"" and now rues it. He asks the spirit who he was, so the narrator can revive his fame in the upper world.
The trunk replies that Virgil's ""pleasant word"" has ""inveigled"" him to speak. He identifies himself as one who held ""Both keys to Frederick’s heart,"" opening and shutting with such skill that ""Scarce any other could admittance find."" His faith to his charge cost him his life-blood. He blames ""The harlot, who ne’er turn’d her gloating eyes From Caesar’s household, common vice and pest Of courts,"" for inflaming minds against him and spreading the flame to Augustus, changing his ""glad honours"" to ""bitter woes."" His soul, ""disdainful and disgusted,"" sought refuge in death from scorn, becoming ""unjust toward myself."" He swears by his new roots that he never broke faith with his liege lord and asks that if any return to the world, they clear his memory from ""envy’s cruel blow.""
Virgil tells the narrator to ask more if he wishes. The narrator replies he cannot, as ""such pity’ is at my heart."" Virgil then asks the imprisoned spirit how the soul is tied in these gnarled joints and if any are ever loosened from such a frame.
The trunk breathes hard, and the wind changes into articulate sounds: ""Briefly ye shall be answer’d. When departs The fierce soul from the body, by itself Thence torn asunder, to the seventh gulf By Minos doom’d, into the wood it falls, No place assign’d, but wheresoever chance Hurls it, there sprouting, as a grain of spelt, It rises to a sapling, growing thence A savage plant."" The Harpies, feeding on its leaves, cause pain and a vent for grief. He states that they, like the rest, will come for their ""own spoils,"" but will not be clad in them again, ""for what a man Takes from himself it is not just he have."" Their bodies will be hung on the ""wild thorn of his wretched shade"" in the dismal glade.
As they listen, a noise like a wild boar and hunt approaching surprises them. Two naked spirits, torn with briers, come in headlong flight, breaking through the wood. The foremost cries, ""Haste now... haste thee death!"" The other, impatient, exclaims, ""Lano! not so bent for speed Thy sinews, in the lists of Toppo’s field."" Then, lacking breath, he makes ""one group"" of himself and a bush. Behind them, the wood is full of ""black female mastiffs, gaunt and fleet,"" like greyhounds. They stick their fangs into the squatted spirit, tear him piecemeal, and carry away the tortured limbs.
Virgil seizes the narrator's hand and leads him to the thicket, which mourns through its bleeding wounds, crying, ""O Giacomo Of Sant’ Andrea! what avails it thee... that of me thou hast made thy screen? For thy ill life what blame on me recoils?""
Virgil asks the thicket who he was. He replies, ""Oh, ye spirits: arriv’d in time To spy the shameful havoc, that from me My leaves hath sever’d thus, gather them up, And at the foot of their sad parent-tree Carefully lay them. In that city’ I dwelt, Who for the Baptist her first patron chang’d, whence he for this shall cease not with his art To work her woe."" He adds that if ""some faint glimpse of him"" (the Baptist) had not remained on Arno's passage, the citizens who rebuilt Florence after Attila would have toiled in vain. He concludes, ""I slung the fatal noose from my own roof.""

**CANTO XIV**
Moved by ""charity of native land,"" the narrator collects the scattered leaves and restores them to the hoarse-speaking spirit. They then reach the limit dividing the second and third rounds, where ""justice is display’d Contrivance horrible.""
They reach a wide plain of ""arid sand and thick,"" resembling the soil Cato trod, which repels all plants. The ""mournful wood waves round Its garland on all sides,"" and the ""sad foss"" spreads around the wood. They stop at the edge of this plain. The narrator exclaims, ""Vengeance of Heav’n! Oh! how shouldst thou be fear’d By all, who read what here my eyes beheld!""
He sees many flocks of naked spirits, all weeping piteously, subject to different laws: some lie supine, some crouch seated, others pace incessantly. The pacers are most numerous, the supine fewest but louder in grief.
Slowly, ""Dilated flakes of fire"" fall over all the sand, like snow on an Alpine summit. Like solid flames descending on Alexander's warriors in India, this ""eternal fiery flood"" falls, making the marble glow beneath, ""doubly to augment the pain.""
Wretched hands ceaselessly play, glancing this way and that, to shake off the falling heat. The narrator asks Virgil who the ""huge spirit"" is that ""heeds not The burning, but lies writhen in proud scorn.""
The spirit himself, aware the narrator asked about him, exclaims, ""Such as I was When living, dead such now I am. If Jove Weary his workman out, from whom in ire He snatch’d the lightnings, that at my last day Transfix’d me... He never should enjoy a sweet revenge.""
Virgil replies in a raised accent, ""Capaneus! Thou art more punish’d, in that this thy pride Lives yet unquench’d: no torrent, save thy rage, Were to thy fury pain proportion’d full.""
Turning to the narrator with a milder lip, Virgil explains that this was one of the ""seven kings, Who girt the Theban walls with siege,"" and still holds God in disdain. He tells the narrator to follow him, keeping close to the wood and not stepping in the hot sand.
They pass silently to a little brook gushing from the forest's bound, whose ""crimson’d wave yet lifts My hair with horror."" This brook runs through the sand, with stone-built bottom and banks, and margins where their passage lies.
Virgil states that of all he has shown, ""nought else so worthy of regard, As is this river,"" has the narrator seen, ""O’er which the flaming volley all is quench’d."" The narrator asks for more information.
Virgil explains that in the midst of the ocean lies Crete, where in old times the world lived pure. A mountain called Ida rises there, once joyous, now deserted. Rhea, Saturn's spouse, chose it for her son's cradle, drowning his cries in shouts. Within the mount, a huge, ancient form stands upright, turning its shoulders toward Damiata and looking at Rome as in a mirror. Its head is of ""finest gold,"" breast and arms of ""pure silver,"" thence to the middle of ""brass,"" and below of ""well-temper’d steel,"" except the right foot of ""potter’s clay,"" on which it stands more erect. Each part except the gold is rent, and from the fissures, tears distill, joining to penetrate a cave. These tears, precipitated down the rock, form Acheron, Styx, and Phlegethon. Then, by a ""straiten’d channel,"" they pass beneath to the ""lowest depth of all,"" forming Cocytus, of which Virgil will give no account yet.
The narrator asks why this sluice appears only now. Virgil replies that the place is round, and though they have passed much, they have not yet made the circuit of the whole orb, descending to the nethermost. So, new appearances should not cause wonder.
The narrator asks where Phlegethon and Lethe flow. Virgil replies that the ""red seething wave"" (Phlegethon) could have resolved one question. Lethe will be seen ""not within this hollow, in the place, Whither to lave themselves the spirits go, Whose blame hath been by penitence remov’d.""
He adds that it is time to quit the wood and tells the narrator to follow his steps, as the margins provide safe passage, unimpeded by flames, for ""over them all vapour is extinct.""

**CANTO XV**
They walk on one of the solid margins, enveloped in a mist rising from the stream, which protects both piers and water from fire. The narrator compares these mounds to those built by Flemings or Paduans to keep back the ocean or Brenta.
They are not so far from the wood that the narrator cannot discern it when they meet a troop of spirits beside the pier. The spirits eye them like people under a new moon or an old tailor at a needle's eye. One spirit recognizes the narrator, catches his skirt, and cries, ""What wonder have we here!""
The narrator, fixing his gaze on the spirit's parched, fire-smirched looks, remembers him and asks, ""Sir! Brunetto! And art thou here?"" Brunetto asks if it would displease the narrator if he turned back a little to talk, leaving his fellows. The narrator eagerly agrees, offering to sit with him if Virgil permits.
Brunetto explains that anyone who stops for an instant in this throng lies for a hundred years without a fan when the fire smites sorest. He tells the narrator to pass on, and he will walk close by his garments, then rejoin his troop. The narrator dares not descend to walk on equal ground, but holds his head down in reverence.
Brunetto asks what chance or destiny brings the narrator there before his last day and who his guide is. The narrator replies that ""up aloft, in the life Serene,"" he wandered lost in a valley before his age reached its fullness. He left it yesterday morning, then returned to that vale, met Virgil, and is now being led back home by this path.
Brunetto replies that if the narrator follows his star, he will reach a ""glorious haven,"" unless Brunetto's judgment erred in ""fairer days."" He says if his fate had not come so early, he would have gladly given comfort in the narrator's work, seeing the heavens so bountiful to him. But he warns that the ""ungrateful and malignant race, Who in old times came down from Fesole,"" will show enmity for his good deeds. He advises the narrator to ""cleanse thee of their ways,"" for his fortune has such honor in reserve that he will be ""crav’d With hunger keen"" by both parties. He compares the ""herd of Fesole"" to goats and the narrator to a sweet fig-tree, suggesting they should not touch him, if any ""holy seed"" (true Romans) still revives among them.
The narrator replies that if his wish were fulfilled, Brunetto would not have been driven from ""man’s nature."" He says Brunetto's ""dear, benign, paternal image"" is fixed in his mind, and he will speak of how he prized Brunetto's lesson on ""the way for man to win eternity"" as long as life endures. He writes down what Brunetto tells him of his fate, keeping it for ""the celestial dame"" (Beatrice) to comment on. He states that his conscience has no plea against him, and he is prepared for whatever fortune does.
Virgil turns back, smiles, and says, ""He listens to good purpose who takes note."" The narrator continues to discourse with Brunetto, asking who are most known among his tribe.
Brunetto replies that to know some is well, but silence is best for the rest, as time would not serve for such a long report. He briefly states that all these were ""clerks, Men of great learning and no less renown, By one same sin polluted."" Priscian is with them, and Francesco, Accorso’s son. He adds that if the narrator wished to see ""so impure a blotch,"" he might have seen one ""who by the servants’ servant was transferr’d From Arno’s seat to Bacchiglione, where His ill-strain’d nerves he left."" Brunetto says he would add more but must desist, as he sees ""A mist new-risen on the sandy plain"" and a company approaching with whom he ""may not sort."" He commends his ""TREASURE"" (his work) to the narrator.
Brunetto then turns and flees, appearing like one who runs for the prize in a race in Verona, not the loser but the winner.

**CANTO XVI**
The narrator reaches a place where the water's din is heard, falling into the next round, like the hum of swarming bees. Three spirits, running swiftly, issue from a troop beneath the ""fierce tormenting storm."" They cry, ""Oh do thou stay! Whom by the fashion of thy garb we deem To be some inmate of our evil land."" The narrator notes the recent and old wounds on their limbs from the flames, which still grieve him.
Virgil pauses, turns to the narrator, and says, ""Wait now! our courtesy these merit well: And were ’t not for the nature of the place, whence glide the fiery darts, I should have said, That haste had better suited thee than them.""
When they stop, the three spirits resume their wail. As they reach them, all three whirl around in a restless wheel. Like naked champions smeared with oil, they watch their hold. Each, as he wheels, directs his countenance at the narrator, neck moving opposite to twinkling feet.
One spirit begins, asking that if their misery and destitution call forth scorn, their ""great renown"" should incline the narrator to say who he is, as he imprints the soil of Hell with ""living feet unharm’d."" He identifies the one whose track he follows as Guidoguerra, grandson of the chaste Gualdrada, a man of high estate who achieved noble acts by wisdom and sword. The next, beating the sand, is Aldobrandi, deserving of honor. The speaker himself is Rusticucci, brought to this evil by his ""savage temper"" wife. The narrator says if he had been sheltered from the fire, he would have cast himself among them, but fear of the burning vanquished his desire for their embrace.
The narrator expresses that not scorn, but grief for their doom, fixed deep within him by Virgil's words, moves him. He identifies himself as a countryman of theirs, who has affectionately uttered and heard their renowned deeds and names. He is leaving ""the gall For the sweet fruit"" with a sure guide, but must first descend ""As to the centre.""
The spirit replies, wishing him long life and bright fame, and asks if ""courtesy and valour"" still dwell in their city (Florence), or have vanished, as a recently condemned spirit, Borsiere, walking with his peers, brings them sad news.
The narrator cries, ""An upstart multitude and sudden gains, Pride and excess, O Florence! have in thee Engender’d, so that now in tears thou mourn’st!"" The three spirits look at each other as men do when truth comes to their ear. They rejoin, saying if he so easily satisfies questioners, he is happy, gifted with words. They ask him, if he escapes this dark clime and returns to see the stars, to speak of them among mankind.
They break the circle and flee swiftly. The narrator's guide pursues his track, and the narrator follows. Soon, the sound of water is so near that they can barely hear each other.
The narrator describes the sound as that of a river falling from a craggy steep, roaring loudly enough to stun the ear, like the Acquacheta river falling from the Alpine summit.
The narrator has a cord that braced his girdle, which he once used to catch the ""painted leopard."" At Virgil's command, he unloosens it, gathers it up, and stretches it forth. Virgil turns to the right, casts it down into the deep abyss, and watches it with an earnest eye. The narrator wonders about this strange signal. He muses on the caution needed with those who spy into thoughts.
Virgil says, ""Quickly shall come... what I expect, Thine eye discover quickly, that whereof Thy thought is dreaming."" The narrator swears by his notes that he saw a shape swimming up through the ""gross and murky air,"" which might have quelled the stoutest heart, like one returning from loosing an anchor or something in the sea, drawing in his feet.

**CANTO XVII**
Virgil addresses the narrator, ""Lo! the fell monster with the deadly sting! Who passes mountains, breaks through fenced walls And firm embattled spears, and with his filth Taints all the world!"" He beckons the monster to shore.
The ""vile image of fraud"" (Geryon) appears, its head and upper part on land, but its ""bestial train"" not on the shore. Its face resembles a ""just man,"" kind and gracious. The rest is serpent, with two shaggy claws reaching to its armpits, and its back, breast, and sides painted with ""nodes And orbits."" Its tail is upturned with a ""venomous fork, With sting like scorpion’s arm’d.""
Virgil says they must turn their way to the beast. They shape their course to the right, proceeding ten paces on the verge to escape the flame and burning marl. Arriving at Geryon, the narrator beholds a tribe of spirits seated on the sand near the chasm. Virgil tells him to go and mark their mien, but not to hold long discourse, as he will parley with Geryon to gain the aid of his ""strong shoulders.""
The narrator walks alone to the extremity of the seventh circle, where the mournful tribe is seated. Their pangs gush forth from their eyes. They alternately ply their hands against the vapors and torrid soil, like dogs in summer against gnats.
The narrator notes the visages of some, but recognizes none. He perceives that each bears a pouch hanging from his neck, marked with various colors and emblems, on which their eye seems to feed. He sees a yellow purse with azure, bearing a lion's countenance. Another, redder than blood, displays a goose. One, bearing a ""fat and azure swine Pictur’d on his white scrip,"" addresses the narrator: ""What dost thou in this deep? Go now and know, Since yet thou livest, that my neighbour here Vitaliano on my left shall sit. A Paduan with these Florentines am I. Ofttimes they thunder in mine ears, exclaiming ‘O haste that noble knight! he who the pouch With the three beaks will bring!’"" He then writhes his mouth and lolls his tongue out. The narrator, lest he displease Virgil by staying too long, turns back.
He finds Virgil already seated on the ""haunch Of the fierce animal."" Virgil encourages him, ""Be thou stout; be bold. Down such a steep flight must we now descend! Mount thou before: for that no power the tail May have to harm thee, I will be i’ th’ midst."" The narrator is terrified, but shame makes him bold. He settles on Geryon's huge shoulders, wishing to say, ""Look thou clasp me firm!"" but the words fail. Virgil, whose succor he has proved before, embraces him and holds him up, saying, ""Geryon! now move thee! be thy wheeling gyres Of ample circuit, easy thy descent. Think on th’ unusual burden thou sustain’st.""
Like a small vessel backing out from land, Geryon loosens and turns his forked tail where his breast had been. He steers like an eel, gathering air with retractile claws. The narrator's dread is immense, greater than Phaeton's or Icarus', as he views only the beast and air around him. Geryon slowly wheels downward, unobserved by the narrator except for the wind rising to his face from below.
On their right, the narrator hears a cataract leap with a hideous crash. Bending to explore, he conceives new terror at the steep plunge, seeing flames and hearing wailings. He crouches, trembling, and then distinguishes how their downward course winds by the torment drawing nearer.
Like a weary falcon descending after a fruitless hunt, Geryon lights, placing them on foot at the base of the ""deep-furrow’d rock."" Discharged of his burden, he springs forward ""like an arrow from the string.""

**CANTO XVIII**
They are in Malebolge, a place in hell, all rock, dark-stained, circling around. In its midst yawns a ""spacious gulf profound."" The circle between the gulf and the high craggy banks forms ten trenches, ""in its hollow bottom sunk."" These are modeled like fosses around a castle, flanked by bridges. Flinty paths advance from the rock's base, crossing the moles and dikes to the gulf.
Dislodged from Geryon's back, they are in this place. Virgil holds his way to the left, and the narrator follows.
On their right, the narrator sees new misery and pains in the first chasm. Naked sinners come toward them from the middle point, moving with a larger stride beyond them. He compares this to Romans during Jubilee, who devise means for thronging multitudes on a bridge, one side fronting the castle, the other the mount.
He sees ""Horn’d demons"" on the grisly rock, with huge lashes, mercilessly striking the sinners' backs, making them bound at the first stripe. None wait for the second or third.
One sinner meets the narrator's sight. He fixes his gaze. Virgil pauses, allowing him to walk backward a space. The tormented spirit tries to hide his face, but the narrator exclaims, ""Thou who dost cast thy eye upon the ground, Unless thy features do belie thee much, Venedico art thou. But what brings thee Into this bitter seas’ning?""
The spirit replies, ""Unwillingly I answer to thy words. But thy clear speech... constrains me."" He reveals he was the one who led ""fair Ghisola To do the Marquis’ will,"" though fame has spread the shameful tale. He adds that Bologna sends many ""barterers"" here, more than tongues taught between the Reno and Savena. He says if the narrator needs proof, to remember their ""craving thirst for gold.""
A demon strikes him with his thong, exclaiming, ""Away! corrupter! here Women are none for sale."" The narrator joins Virgil, and they reach a rock issuing from the bank. Ascending it, they turn right, departing from the ""eternal barriers.""
Arriving where the ""gaping arch lets pass The scourged souls,"" Virgil tells the narrator to pause and look at these ""miserable others,"" whose faces he has not yet seen, though they have walked with them. From the old bridge, they eye the pack coming from the other side, excoriated from the lash.
Virgil, unasked, identifies a ""lofty shade"" tending their way, who seems too woe-begone to weep, yet retains a regal aspect. This is Jason, whose skill won the ram from Colchos. He went to the Lemnian isle, where pitiless women had slain all their males. There, he beguiled Hypsipyle, a young virgin, with ""tokens and fair witching words,"" leaving her pregnant and forlorn. This guilt condemns him. Medea's injuries are also avenged here. All who practiced similar deceit bear him company. Virgil says this much suffices for the first vale.
They reach the next pier, crossing to another arch. In the second chasm, they hear ghosts ""jibber in low melancholy sounds,"" snort with wide-stretched nostrils, and smite themselves with their palms. A scurf from the foul steam hangs encrusting the banks, combating sight and smell.
The depth is so hollow that the narrator can distinguish nothing except from the summit of the rocky span. From there, he sees a crowd immersed in ordure, appearing like ""Draff of the human body."" He marks one with a grimed head, hard to deem if clerk or layman, who cries, ""Why greedily thus bendest more on me, Than on these other filthy ones, thy ken?""
The narrator replies that if his memory is true, he has seen him with dry locks and he is Alessio of Lucca. The spirit, beating on his brain, says, ""Me thus low down my flatteries have sunk, Wherewith I ne’er enough could glut my tongue.""
Virgil tells the narrator to stretch his face a little to note the visage of a ""besotted, sluttish courtezan,"" who rends herself with defiled nails, now crouching, now risen. This is Thais, the harlot, whose false lip answered her paramour, ""Say rather wondrously"" to ""Thankest me much!"" Virgil says their view is satiated.

**CANTO XIX**
The narrator exclaims woe to Simon Magus and his followers, who prostitute ""the things of God"" for gold and silver. He declares this is the third chasm. They mount the following vault, where the rock impends directly over the chasm's center.
He praises ""Wisdom Supreme"" for its wonderful art and just allotment of punishment. He sees the ""livid stone"" full of circular apertures, equal in width, like baptismal fonts in Saint John's dome. He mentions breaking one of these fonts years past to save a drowning infant, wishing this to be a seal to undeceive doubters of his motive. From each aperture emerges a sinner's feet and legs up to the calf, the rest hidden. The soles of their feet are burning, causing their joints to quiver violently. Flames glide from heel to point.
The narrator asks who is ""Glancing in fiercer agony, on whom A ruddier flame doth prey?"" Virgil offers to carry him down where the bank is least steep, so the spirit can tell his story. The narrator agrees, trusting Virgil's will.
They descend to the depth of the fourth pier, a narrow, perforated strait. Virgil does not set him down until he reaches the orifice of the quivering limb. The narrator addresses the ""sad spirit,"" asking him to speak if he can. He stands like a friar shriving a condemned wretch.
The spirit shouts, ""Ha! already standest there? Already standest there, O Boniface! By many a year the writing play’d me false. So early dost thou surfeit with the wealth, For which thou fearedst not in guile to take The lovely lady, and then mangle her?""
The narrator, not understanding, feels mocked. Virgil admonishes him to quickly say, ""I am not he, not he, whom thou believ’st."" The narrator replies as enjoined.
The spirit wrenches his feet and sighs woefully, asking what the narrator requires. He then reveals that he was robed ""in the mighty mantle"" (Pope) and was the son of a ""she-bear,"" eager to advance his ""whelps"" (family), so he ""stow’d"" his wealth above and himself here. He says the rest, his ""predecessors in the guilt Of simony,"" are dragged under his head, lying along an opening in the rock. He will fall low when the one he mistook the narrator for arrives, but more time has passed since his soul kindled than is his doom to stand. He prophesies that after him, ""One yet of deeds more ugly shall arrive, From forth the west, a shepherd without law, Fated to cover both his form and mine."" He will be called a ""new Jason"" and receive favor from ""France’s monarch.""
The narrator, perhaps presuming too far, asks what treasures Christ demanded from St. Peter when giving him the keys, noting he asked only ""Follow me!"" and that Peter and the others took no gold or silver for Matthias's replacement. He tells the spirit his punishment is merited and to look well to the ""ill-gotten coin."" He says if reverence for the keys did not restrain him, he would use severer speech. He blames avarice for casting the world in mourning, treading good, and raising bad men. He says the Evangelist was aware of such shepherds when he saw ""her, who sits upon the waves, With kings in filthy whoredom,"" who ""with seven heads tower’d at her birth, And from ten horns her proof of glory drew."" He accuses them of making gold and silver their god, differing from idolaters only in worshipping a hundred gods instead of one. He laments, ""Ah, Constantine! to how much ill gave birth, Not thy conversion, but that plenteous dower, Which the first wealthy Father gain’d from thee!""
As the narrator sings, the spirit, whether from wrath or conscience, violently springs up, spinning on either sole. Virgil, pleased, catches the narrator in his arms and lifts him, retracing his descent. He carries him without weariness to the summit of the rock, their passage from the fourth to the fifth pier. He gently places his ""cherish’d burden"" on the rugged rock, a path difficult for a goat.
Thence, another vale appears to the narrator.

**CANTO XX**
The narrator now proceeds to new torments in the twentieth canto. He looks into the depth, moistened with tears, and sees a tribe weeping silently, advancing along the hollow vale like choirs chanting litanies.
As his eye descends, he sees each spirit ""wondrously seem’d to be revers’d At the neck-bone, so that the countenance Was from the reins averted."" Compelled to advance with backward gait, none can look before him. The narrator leans against a rock and weeps. Virgil exclaims, ""What, and art thou too witless as the rest? Here pity most doth show herself alive, When she is dead. What guilt exceedeth his, Who with Heaven’s judgment in his passion strives?""
Virgil tells him to raise his head and see Amphiaraus, before whose eyes earth gaped in Thebes, and who now makes his breast his shoulders, looking backward. He points out Tiresias, who changed from male to female and back.
Aruns comes next, ""with more his belly facing,"" who dwelt in a cavern in Luni's mountains, from which he viewed the stars and sea.
Next is Manto, whose ""loosen’d tresses overspread Her bosom."" She searched many regions and fixed her seat in Virgil's native land (Mantua). Virgil recounts her story: after her father's death, she wandered the world. In Italy, a lake called Benacus lies at the foot of an Alp. Where it drains, it forms the Mincius river, which flows to the Po. Manto saw a ""waste And naked"" territory amidst the fen, where she remained with her slaves, practicing her arts, and left her body there. Tribes gathered and built a city, calling it Mantua, for her sake. Virgil warns the narrator against other origins assigned to his country.
The narrator accepts Virgil's words as certain and asks if he sees any other spirits of note. Virgil points out Eurypilus, a seer in Aulis, who gave the sign to cut the cable when Greece was emptied of its males. He then points to Michael Scot, slender in shape, ""Practis’d in ev’ry slight of magic wile.""
He also points out Guido Bonatti and Asdente, who now repents not having tended his thread and cordwain. Next are ""wretches, who the needle left, The shuttle and the spindle, and became Diviners,"" working ""baneful witcheries with images and herbs.""
Virgil then says they must move on, as ""Cain with fork of thorns"" (the moon) now confines on either hemisphere, touching the wave beneath Seville's towers, and the moon was round yesternight, serving them well in the gloomy wood. Both move onward.

**CANTO XXI**
They pass from bridge to bridge, with other talk, reaching the summit to view another gap in Malebolge, with ""other bootless pangs."" Marvelous darkness shadows the place.
The narrator describes the scene like pitch boiling in the Venetian arsenal to smear unsound vessels. Here, by ""art divine,"" a ""glutinous thick mass"" boils, liming all the shore beneath. He distinguishes nothing but the surge of the boiling. Virgil draws him back, exclaiming, ""Mark! mark!""
The narrator turns and sees a ""devil black"" running up the rock, with fierce cruelty in his look, buoyant wings, and nimble feet. His shoulder is charged with a sinner, held by either haunch, gripping the foot's sinew.
The devil cries to his ""keen-talon’d fiends,"" ""Ye of our bridge! Lo! one of Santa Zita’s elders! Him Whelm ye beneath, while I return for more. That land hath store of such. All men are there, Except Bonturo, barterers: of ‘no’ For lucre there an ‘aye’ is quickly made.""
He dashes the sinner down, turns, and speeds back. The sinner sinks and then writhes to the surface. The dark demons, shrouded by the bridge, cry, ""Here the hallow’d visage saves not: here Is other swimming than in Serchio’s wave. Wherefore if thou desire we rend thee not, Take heed thou mount not o’er the pitch."" They grapple him with ""more than hundred hooks,"" shouting, ""Cover’d thou must sport thee here; So, if thou canst, in secret mayst thou filch."" The narrator compares this to a cook thrusting flesh into a cauldron.
Virgil tells the narrator to hide behind a craggy rock so they don't see him, and not to fear any force or insult, as he is ""well advis’d."" Virgil passes beyond the bridge's head to the sixth pier, needing a ""forehead terror-proof.""
The demons rush forth from beneath the arch like dogs on a poor man, pointing their weapons at Virgil. He cries, ""Be none of you outrageous: ere your time Dare seize me, come forth from amongst you one, Who having heard my words, decide he then If he shall tear these limbs."" They shout, ""Go, Malacoda!"" One demon advances, asking what this turn will avail Virgil.
Virgil replies, ""Believ’st thou, Malacoda! I had come Thus far from all your skirmishing secure, without will divine And destiny propitious?"" He states Heaven's pleasure is for him to lead another through this wilderness. Malacoda's pride falls, he drops his instrument of torture, and exclaims to the rest, ""We have no power To strike him.""
Virgil tells the narrator, who is crouching on the bridge, to return safely. The narrator rises and moves with speed, fearing the fiends might break their compact. He compares this to infantry dreading a foe breaking a covenant at Caprona.
The narrator adheres to Virgil's side, watching the fiends. They protrude their hooks, one asking another, ""Wilt thou I touch him on the hip?"" The reply is, ""Even so; nor miss thy aim.""
Malacoda, who was conferring with Virgil, turns and tells the demon, ""Stay, stay thee, Scarmiglione!"" He then tells them that the rock provides no further footing, being ""shiver’d to the base Of the sixth arch."" But if they wish to proceed, they must go up a cavern, where ""another rock will yield you passage safe."" He explains that ""Yesterday, later by five hours than now, Twelve hundred threescore years and six had fill’d The circuit of their course, since here the way Was broken."" He dispatches ten of his scouts to spy if any bask on the surface, telling them to go with the travelers, as they will find them ""nothing fell."" He names them: Alichino, Calcabrina, Cagnazzo, Barbariccia (to lead the troop of ten), Libicocco, Draghinazzo, Fang’d Ciriatto, Grafflacane, Farfarello, and Rubicant. He instructs them to search around the bubbling tar and safely lead the travelers where the other crag traverses the dens.
The narrator asks Virgil what a sight this is, wishing not to journey without escort, and noting their snarls and threats. Virgil tells him not to fear, as their gnarls are only ""in token of their spite Against the souls, who mourn in torment steep’d.""
The demons turn left over the pier, each pressing his tongue between his teeth, looking to their leader for a signal, which he gives with an ""obscene triumphant"" sound.

**CANTO XXII**
The narrator describes having seen various military maneuvers, but never such a strange formation of horse or foot, or ship, as the ten demons moving with their leader. He calls it a ""fearful company.""
He gazes earnestly at the pitch to mark everything in the chasm. Like dolphins showing their backs to mariners, some sinners show their backs to ease pain, then hide more nimbly than lightning. Like frogs at a moat's brink, with only jaws out, the sinners stand, but draw back under the wave when Barbariccia approaches.
The narrator sees one sinner who waits. Graffiacan, the nearest fiend, seizes his ""clotted locks"" and drags him up, making him appear like an otter. The narrator knew their names from when they were chosen. The crew shouts, ""O Rubicant! See that his hide thou with thy talons flay.""
The narrator asks Virgil who this wretched soul is. Virgil approaches and asks whence he came. The spirit replies he was born in Navarre, his mother placed him in a lord's retinue, as she bore him to a ""losel vile."" He served King Thibault, then turned to ""peculating,"" for which he gives account in this heat.
Ciriatto, with tusks like a boar, rips him with one. Barbariccia seizes him with both arms, crying, ""Stand thou apart, While I do fix him on my prong transpierc’d."" He tells Virgil to inquire further before the sinner is rent again. Virgil asks about his partners in guilt from Latian land. The spirit replies he just parted from one not far thence, wishing he were under shelter with him.
Libicocco cries, ""Too long we suffer,"" and seizes his arm with a prong, mangling the sinewy part. Draghinazzo tries to catch him by the thighs, but their chief restrains them. When the strife ceases, Virgil asks about the spirit from whom he parted.
The spirit replies it was ""the friar Gomita... He of Gallura, vessel of all guile,"" who had his master's enemies in hand and dismissed them for money, playing the part of a ""barterer to the height."" Michel Zanche, chief of Logodoro, herds with him. Sardinia is a constant theme for them. The spirit then trembles, seeing another fiend grin.
The captain rebukes Farfarello, who was about to strike. The quaking spirit then offers to cause Tuscan or Lombard spirits to appear if the fiends bate their fury, promising to make seven appear with his whistle.
Cagnazzo grins deridingly, wagging his head, saying, ""Hear his device, Mischievous as he is, to plunge him down."" The spirit replies it is ""Mischief forsooth extreme, Meant only to procure myself more woe!""
Alichino, gainsaying the rest, says if the spirit casts himself down, he will not chase on foot but beat his plumes above the pitch. He suggests they quit the vantage ground and use the bank as a shield to see if he can prevail.
The narrator notes the new sport. The fiends turn their eyes to the other shore. The spirit of Navarre chooses his time, plants his feet on land, and escapes in one leap. Resentment stings the fiends, especially Alichino, who pursues, crying, ""Thou art caught."" But terror outstrips him. The sinner plunges beneath, and Alichino raises his breast with upward pinion.
Calcabrina, enraged by the mockery, flies after Alichino and turns his talons on his comrade. They grapple over the dyke and fall into the boiling lake. The heat acts as umpire, but they cannot lift themselves, their pennons glued. Barbariccia dispatches four others from the other coast, armed with weapons. They descend to their posts, stretching hooks toward the floundering fiends. The narrator and Virgil depart, leaving them to the broil.

**CANTO XXIII**
They go in silence and solitude, like minor friars. The fray makes the narrator muse on Aesop's fable of the mouse and frog. He fears the demons, reasoning that they will pursue them more fiercely due to their recent foil and mockery. He feels his hair stand on end and looks back.
The narrator tells Virgil they must hide quickly from the ""evil talons,"" as imagination makes him feel them already. Virgil replies that his thoughts came before his own, and he has formed one design from both. If the right coast inclines enough to descend into the next chasm, they will escape.
Before Virgil finishes, the narrator sees the demons with spread wings approaching. Virgil catches him like a mother snatching her babe from climbing fires, casting himself supine down from the jutting beach to a pendent rock that closes one part of the chasm.
Virgil runs along the edge, carrying the narrator in his bosom. Scarcely had his feet reached the lowest bed when the demons reached the steep above them. But Virgil has no fear, as ""high Providence"" took from them the power to depart from the fifth foss.
In the depth, they see a ""painted tribe,"" pacing slowly, weeping, faint and toiled. They wear caps with hoods like Cologne monks, overlaid with dazzling gold but leaden within, so heavy that ""Frederick’s compar’d to these were straw."" The narrator calls it ""everlasting wearisome attire!""
They turn left with them, intent on their dismal moan. The fainting people move so slowly that their company changes with every step. The narrator asks Virgil to find a spirit whose name is known by his deeds.
One spirit, hearing the Tuscan voice, cries aloud, ""Hold in your feet, Ye who so swiftly speed through the dusk air. Perchance from me thou shalt obtain thy wish."" Virgil tells the narrator to pause and then proceed at their pace.
The narrator waits and sees two spirits eager to overtake him, but their load and the narrow path retard them. They eye him askance, then confer, saying, ""This one Seems, by the action of his throat, alive. And, be they dead, what privilege allows They walk unmantled by the cumbrous stole?""
They ask the narrator, ""Tuscan, who visitest The college of the mourning hypocrites, Disdain not to instruct us who thou art."" The narrator replies he was bred in Florence by the Arno and wears the body he has ever worn. He asks who they are and what torment causes their grief.
One answers that their ""bonnets gleaming bright with orange hue"" are so ""leaden gross"" that their weight makes balances crack. They were ""Joyous friars,"" natives of Bologna, Catalano and Loderingo. They were taken by Florence as arbiters to reconcile strifes, and Gardingo's vicinage can best declare how they fared.
The narrator begins to speak of their miseries but breaks off, seeing a spirit ""Fix’d to a cross with three stakes on the ground."" This spirit writhes distortedly, ruffling his beard. Catalano explains that this ""pierced spirit"" was he ""who gave the Pharisees Counsel, that it were fitting for one man To suffer for the people."" He lies transverse, and everyone must make ""feeling trial how each weighs"" by passing over him. The father of his consort and other partakers in that council are placed in similar straits. The narrator notes Virgil's wonder.
Virgil asks the friar if there is an opening on their right to exit without compelling the dark angels. The friar replies that ""Nearer than thou dost hope, there is a rock From the next circle moving, which o’ersteps Each vale of horror, save that here his cope Is shatter’d. By the ruin ye may mount: For on the side it slants, and most the height Rises below.""
Virgil stands with head bent, then says, ""He warn’d us ill, Who yonder hangs the sinners on his hook."" The friar replies that at Bologna, he heard many vices of the devil, including ""He is a liar, And the father of lies!"" Virgil then proceeds with large strides, disturbed with anger.
The narrator leaves the heavy-laden spirits and follows Virgil's footsteps.

**CANTO XXIV**
In the early part of the year, when the sun is in Aquarius and nights recede towards equal day, the rime whitens the plain. A village hind, lacking winter stores, smites his thighs in impatience, then finds new hope as the world changes countenance, grasps his crook, and drives his flock to pasture. Similarly, the narrator was disheartened by Virgil's troubled forehead, but this ill was cured when they arrived at the fallen bridge. Virgil turned back with a sweet look, like the one at the mountain's foot.
Regarding the ruin, and after some thought, Virgil opens his arm and takes the narrator up. Like one who computes his labor's issue, Virgil lifts him to the summit of one peak, then fixes his eye on another, saying, ""Grapple that... but first make proof, if it be such As will sustain thee."" The narrator notes that for one capped with lead, this would be no journey. Even for him, though light, and the narrator, pushed from crag to crag, it is difficult. If the precinct were not less ample than the last, his strength would have failed. Malebolge inclines toward the mouth of the nethermost abyss, so each valley slopes upward on one side and falls on the other.
They reach the point of descent from the last flag. The narrator is so exhausted he must sit. Virgil tells him, ""Now needs thy best of man; For not on downy plumes, nor under shade Of canopy reposing, fame is won, Without which whosoe’er consumes his days Leaveth such vestige of himself on earth, As smoke in air or foam upon the wave. Thou therefore rise: vanish thy weariness By the mind’s effort... A longer ladder yet remains to scale. From these to have escap’d sufficeth not. If well thou note me, profit by my words.""
The narrator rises, showing himself less spent than he feels, crying, ""On, For I am stout and fearless."" They hold their way up the rock, more rugged, narrower, and steeper. The narrator talks ceaselessly to appear least faint. A voice from the other foss issues forth, ""for utt’rance suited ill."" Though on the arch, the narrator cannot make out the words but perceives anger. He stoops to look but cannot see due to darkness. He asks Virgil to bend their steps to the next circle and dismount from the wall, as he cannot hear or see. Virgil replies, ""I answer not... but by the deed. To fair request Silent performance maketh best return.""
They descend from the bridge's head to the eighth mound. The chasm opens, revealing a crowd of ""serpents terrible, so strange of shape And hideous."" The narrator says Lybia cannot boast of such a brood.
Amid this ""dread exuberance of woe,"" naked spirits run, ""wing’d with horrid fear,"" with no hope of hiding. Serpents bind their hands behind them, their tails and heads twisted in folds before. An adder darts up and transpierces one spirit near them, where the neck joins the shoulders. More quickly than a pen writes O or I, he kindles, burns, and changes to ashes. The dust then spontaneously re-rolls and instantly resumes the self-same form. The narrator compares this to the Arabian Phoenix. The sinner stands aghast when he rises.
The narrator laments God's severe judgment. Virgil asks who he was. He replies, ""Vanni Fucci am I call’d, Not long since rained down from Tuscany To this dire gullet. Me the beastial life And not the human pleas’d, mule that I was, Who in Pistoia found my worthy den.""
The narrator tells Virgil to make him stay and ask his crime, as he knew him as ""choleric and bloody."" The sinner, hearing this, does not feign, but turns his face, depicting dismal shame. He says it grieves him more to be caught in this plight than when he was taken from life. He is doomed for rifling the sacristy of its ornaments and falsely charging another. But so the narrator may not joy, he forebodes: ""Reft of the Neri first Pistoia pines, Then Florence changeth citizens and laws. From Valdimagra, drawn by wrathful Mars, A vapour rises, wrapt in turbid mists, And sharp and eager driveth on the storm With arrowy hurtling o’er Piceno’s field, whence suddenly the cloud shall burst, and strike Each helpless Bianco prostrate to the ground. This have I told, that grief may rend thy heart.""

**CANTO XXV**
After speaking, the sinner raises his hands in mockery, crying, ""Take them, God! I level them at thee!"" From that day, the serpents become the narrator's friends. One serpent rolls around his neck, twisting as if saying, ""Be silent, tongue!"" Another glides up his arms, tying them and riveting itself so close it takes away their power to move.
The narrator laments Pistoia's evil. He notes he did not see any spirit swell so proudly against God, not even the one who fell headlong from Thebes. The sinner flees without another word. A centaur, full of fury, comes after him, shouting, ""Where Where is the caitiff?"" Serpents swarm on his haunch up to where his human face begins. Behind his head, on his shoulders, lies a dragon with open wings, breathing fire. Virgil identifies him as Cacus, who spread a lake of blood under the rock of Aventine. He is here for his ""fraudful theft Of the great herd,"" his deeds ended by Alcides' mace.
While Virgil speaks, the centaur speeds away. Three spirits come up from below, unnoticed until they exclaim, ""Say who are ye?"" They break off discourse. The narrator does not know them, but one names another, asking, ""Where Doth Cianfa lurk?"" The narrator puts a finger to his lips, signaling Virgil to be attentive. He tells the reader not to marvel if he doesn't credit what he tells, as he himself scarce allows his eyes' witness.
As he looks, a six-footed serpent springs onto one spirit, fastening upon him: its midmost feet grasp the belly, forefeet seize each arm, fangs flesh deep in cheeks, and hinder feet spread on thighs, tail curled on the reins. Ivy never clasped an oak as the monster entwines the spirit. Then, like burning wax, each melts into the other, mingling hues, so that ""which was either now was seen no more."" The other two exclaim, ""Ah, how dost thou change, Agnello! See! Thou art nor double now, Nor only one."" The two heads become one, and two figures blend into one form, where both are lost. Two arms are made of four lengths; belly, chest, thighs, and legs change into unseen members. All trace of former shape vanishes. The miscreated image passes on with tardy steps, seeming neither of the two.
As a lizard shifts from brake to brake, an adder all on fire, ""livid and swart,"" approaches the entrails of the other two. It transpierces one where life is first nourished. The pierced spirit falls, looks at the serpent, but speaks not, standing motionless and yawning. The serpent eyes him, and he the serpent. One breathes thick smoke from the wound, the other from the mouth, their vapory columns joining.
The narrator says Lucan and Ovid should be mute, as they never sang of two natures so transmuted face to face. The serpent splits its tail into a fork, and the pierced spirit draws his steps together, legs and thighs compacted, so no juncture is visible. The tail takes the figure the spirit lost, its skin softening, his indurated to a rind. Shoulders join the monster's armpits, its two shorter feet lengthen as the other's shrink. The feet behind twist up to become the part man conceals, which in the wretch is cleft in twain. The smoke veils both with new color, generating an excrescent pile on one, peeling it off the other. One rises upright, the other falls prone. Their ""glaring and malignant lamps"" (eyes) are not yet shifted, though features change. Of the one standing, the face retreats toward the temples, superfluous matter shoots out in ears from smooth cheeks, the rest shapes the nose, and lips swell. The one on the earth extends his sharpened visage, drawing down his ears like a slug. His continuous tongue severs, and the other's fork closes. The smoke lays. The soul, transformed into the brute, glides off, hissing. The other, talking, sputters, then turns his new-grown shoulders and says to another, ""Along this path Crawling, as I have done, speed Buoso now!""
The narrator saw the ""unsteady ballast of the seventh hold"" fluctuate in change. He notes that Sciancato alone of the first three did not change. He adds that Gaville still rues the other's fate.

**CANTO XXVI**
The narrator exclaims, ""Florence exult!"" for her thriving, but notes shame that three of her citizens are among the plunderers in hell. He foresees future woe for Florence, greater than Prato wishes.
They depart from the depth, Virgil remounting the flinty steps, drawing the narrator up. They proceed on their solitary way, using hands and feet among the crags.
Sorrow seizes the narrator as he recalls what he saw, and he curbs his nature lest it run where virtue guides not. He doesn't envy himself the boon of his gentle star.
In the season when the sun least veils its face, and gnats replace flies, a peasant sees innumerable fire-flies. Similarly, the eighth chasm shines with ""flames so numberless."" Like Elijah's chariot seen by the avenged bears, every flame moves along the gulf, a sinner ""enfolded close in each,"" so none shows ""token of the theft.""
The narrator bends forward on the bridge to look, grasping a flinty mass to avoid falling. Virgil, noting his gaze, says, ""Within these ardours are the spirits, each Swath’d in confining fire."" The narrator replies he understood this, but asks who is in the flame that comes ""so parted at the summit,"" like the Theban brothers' funeral pile. Virgil replies, ""Ulysses there and Diomede endure Their penal tortures, thus to vengeance now Together hasting, as erewhile to wrath."" They deplore the ambush of the horse that opened a portal for the seed of imperial Rome, and the guile that reft Achilles from Deidamia, and the stratagem that spoiled Troy of its Palladium.
The narrator asks if they can speak from within the sparks, begging Virgil to pause until the ""horned flame"" arrives. Virgil praises his prayer but tells him to refrain his tongue, as he will question them, divining his wish, and they, being Greeks, might shun discourse with him.
When the flame arrives, Virgil asks, ""O ye, who dwell two spirits in one fire! If living I of you did merit aught... Move ye not on, till one of you unfold In what clime death o’ertook him self-destroy’d.""
The greater horn of the old flame begins to roll, murmuring like a fire in the wind, then wags its top like a tongue, and speaks: ""When I escap’d From Circe, who beyond a circling year Had held me near Caieta... Nor fondness for my son, nor reverence Of my old father, nor return of love... Could overcome in me the zeal I had T’ explore the world, and search the ways of life, Man’s evil and his virtue."" He sailed into the ""deep illimitable main"" with one bark and a small band, seeing both shores of Iberia and Morocco, and Sardinia and other islands. He and his companions were old when they reached the ""strait pass, where Hercules ordain’d The bound’ries not to be o’erstepp’d by man."" He left Seville's walls to his right and passed Ceuta. He urged his brothers, who had reached the west through perils, not to refuse proof of the ""unpeopled world,"" following Phoebus, reminding them they were not formed to live like brutes but to pursue virtue and knowledge. With these words, he sharpened their minds. They turned their poop to the dawn, making their oars wings, gaining on the left. They saw the stars of the other pole, and theirs so low it rose not from the ocean floor. Five times the moon's light vanished since they entered the deep way, when a dim mountain appeared, the loftiest he ever beheld. Joy seized them, but soon changed to mourning. A whirlwind sprung from the new land, struck the vessel, whirled it thrice, lifted the poop, and sank the prow, and ""over us the booming billow clos’d.""

**CANTO XXVII**
The flame rises and stills its light, speaking no more. It passes on with Virgil's leave. Another flame follows, from whose top a confused sound draws their eyes.
The narrator compares the sound to the Sicilian bull, which made the tormented's cries sound as if the brazen monster itself was pierced. The dismal words turn into language, and then from the point of the flame, they hear: ""O thou! to whom I now direct my voice! That lately didst exclaim in Lombard phrase, ‘Depart thou, I solicit thee no more,’ Though somewhat tardy I perchance arrive Let it not irk thee here to pause awhile, And with me parley: lo! it irks not me And yet I burn."" He asks if those in Romagna have peace or war, as he was from the mountains between Urbino and the source of the Tiber.
The narrator listens, and Virgil touches his side, saying, ""Speak thou: he is a Latian."" The narrator replies that Romagna was never without war in its tyrants' bosoms, nor is it now, but he left no ""open war."" Ravenna's state is steadfast, ruled by Polenta's eagle. The ""green talons"" grasp the land that withstood the French host. The ""old mastiff of Verruchio and the young"" still make an auger of their fangs. Lamone's city and Santerno's range under the ""lion of the snowy lair,"" an inconstant partisan. The city washed by Savio's wave lives ""’twixt tyrant power and liberty."" The narrator asks who the spirit is.
The fire roars, its sharpened point waving, then breathes: ""If I did think, my answer were to one, Who ever could return unto the world, This flame should rest unshaken. But since ne’er... any from this depth Has found his upward way, I answer thee, Nor fear lest infamy record the words.""
He states he was ""A man of arms at first,"" then clothed himself in ""good Saint Francis’ girdle,"" hoping to make amends. His hope would not have failed, but ""the high priest again seduc’d me into sin."" He explains that while he lived, his deeds were more like a fox than a lion, knowing ""All ways of winding subtlety."" When he came to the part of life where one ""behoves To lower sails,"" he rued his past and turned to repentance and confession.
Meanwhile, ""The chief of the new Pharisees"" (Pope Boniface VIII) waged war near the Lateran, not against Saracens or Jews, but Christians. He did not reverence his charge or the cord (Franciscan habit) that marked leanness. Like Constantine seeking Sylvester's aid for leprosy, this man sought his counsel to cure his pride. The spirit was silent, for his words seemed drunken, but the Pope resumed, ""From thy heart banish fear: of all offence I hitherto absolve thee. In return, Teach me my purpose so to execute, That Penestrino cumber earth no more. Heav’n, as thou knowest, I have power to shut And open: and the keys are therefore twain, The which my predecessor meanly priz’d.""
Yielding to these arguments, the spirit deemed silence more perilous and answered, ""Father! since thou washest me Clear of that guilt wherein I now must fall, Large promise with performance scant, be sure, Shall make thee triumph in thy lofty seat.""
He continues: ""When I was number’d with the dead, then came Saint Francis for me; but a cherub dark He met, who cried: ‘Wrong me not; he is mine, And must below to join the wretched crew, For the deceitful counsel which he gave. E’er since I watch’d him, hov’ring at his hair, No power can the impenitent absolve; Nor to repent and will at once consist, By contradiction absolute forbid.’"" He describes his misery when the cherub seized him, saying, ""Thou haply thought’st me not A disputant in logic so exact."" He was borne to Minos, who twined his tail eight times, biting it in rage, saying, ""This is a guilty soul, that in the fire Must vanish."" Hence, he roves, ""A prey to rankling sorrow in this garb.""
The flame parts in dolour, beating and writhing its sharp horn. The narrator and Virgil move onward up the rock to another arch overhanging the foss, where the penalty for ""committed sin"" is paid.

**CANTO XXVIII**
The narrator states that no words can fully describe the wounds and blood he now saw in the ninth chasm, comparing it to the vast bloodshed in Apulia by Trojans, in the Punic wars, by Guiscard's Norman steel, and at Ceperano or Tagliacozzo. A rundlet (cask) does not gape so wide as one spirit he marks, torn from chin to ""hinder passage,"" his entrails dangling, midriff and ventricle open.
As the narrator gazes, the spirit eyes him, bares his breast with his hands, and cries, ""Now mark how I do rip me! lo! How is Mohammed mangled! before me Walks Ali weeping, from the chin his face Cleft to the forelock; and the others all Whom here thou seest, while they liv’d, did sow Scandal and schism, and therefore thus are rent."" He explains that a fiend behind them hacks them cruelly with a sword, slivering them again after their gashes close as they complete their dismal way. He asks who the narrator is, lingering to delay pain.
Virgil replies that death has not yet overtaken him, nor does sin conduct him to torment. He is dead and must conduct the narrator through hell to make ""Full trial of your state.""
More than a hundred spirits, amazed, stand in the foss to mark the narrator, forgetting their pangs. Mohammed, with foot upraised, speaks to the narrator: ""Thou, who perchance Shalt shortly view the sun, this warning thou Bear to Dolcino: bid him, if he wish not Here soon to follow me, that with good store Of food he arm him, lest impris’ning snows Yield him a victim to Novara’s power, No easy conquest else."" He then fixes his foot to depart.
Another shade, pierced in the throat, with mutilated nostrils and one ear lopt off, advances from the rest, baring his windpipe, smeared with crimson. He asks the narrator, whom sin condemns not, if he remembers Piero of Medicina, whom he saw in Latian ground. He asks him to instruct ""the twain, whom Fano boasts Her worthiest sons, Guido and Angelo,"" that if the future can be scanned, they will be cast forth from life and whelmed under the waves near Cattolica through a ""perfidy Of a fell tyrant."" He describes this injury as fouler than any Neptune has seen. He says that ""one-ey’d traitor"" (Malatestino) will bring them to conference and shape their end so they will need no prayers against Focara's wind.
The narrator asks who the one is who wakes such sad remembrance in him. The spirit lays his hand on another's cheek-bone, expanding his jaws, and cries, ""Lo! this is he I wot of; He speaks not for himself: the outcast this Who overwhelm’d the doubt in Caesar’s mind, Affirming that delay to men prepar’d Was ever harmful."" The narrator notes how terrified Curio seemed, whose tongue was cut. Then one ""Maim’d of each hand"" lifts his bleeding stumps, which sully his face, and cries, ""Remember thee Of Mosca, too, I who, alas! exclaim’d, “The deed once done there is an end,” that prov’d A seed of sorrow to the Tuscan race."" The narrator adds, ""Ay, and death to thine own tribe."" Mosca hurries off, grief-stung.
The narrator lingers to behold the troop and sees things he fears to tell without more proof, but conscience makes him firm. He sees a headless trunk, pacing onward, bearing its severed head ""lantern-wise Pendent in hand,"" which looks at them and says, ""Woe’s me!"" The spirit lights himself thus, and ""two there were in one, and one in two."" When he stands at the bridge's foot, he rears his arm aloft, thrusting the head into view so they might hear its words: ""Now behold This grievous torment... behold if any else Be terrible as this. And that on earth Thou mayst bear tidings of me, know that I Am Bertrand, he of Born, who gave King John The counsel mischievous. Father and son I set at mutual war... For parting those so closely knit, my brain Parted, alas! I carry from its source, That in this trunk inhabits. Thus the law Of retribution fiercely works in me.""

**CANTO XXIX**
The narrator's eyes are so ""inebriate with view Of the vast multitude"" that he longs to stay and weep. Virgil rouses him, asking why he gazes below among the maimed shades, noting he has not shown this weakness in other chasms. He explains the valley winds ""two and twenty miles,"" and the moon is already beneath their feet, so time is short.
The narrator replies that if Virgil had weighed the cause for his looking, he might have excused his tarrying. He adds that he deems a spirit of his blood dwells in that cave, wailing his crime.
Virgil tells him not to afflict himself for him. He says that at the bridge's foot, he marked the spirit point with a menacing look at the narrator and heard him named Geri of Bello. The narrator was so busy with the spirit who once ruled Hautefort that he did not look that way before he was gone. The narrator explains that Geri's ""violent death yet unaveng’d"" made him contemptuous, so he passed speechless, making the narrator more compassionate.
They discourse to where the rock first shows the other valley, which would have more light if it were there. As they reach the ""last cloister"" of Malebolge, a ""many a dart Of sore lament"" assails the narrator, so he closes his ears.
He describes the torment as if all the lazar-houses of Valdichiana, Sardinia, and Maremma's fen had heaped their maladies in one foss, with a dire stench.
They descend to the left on the utmost shore of the long rock. The narrator's sight is livelier to explore the depth where ""All-searching Justice"" dooms forgers. He compares the scene to the nation in Aegina drooping from a pestilent air, but more rueful. He sees spirits languishing, piled on many a stack, confused, one over another, some crawling sideling.
They journey step by step, silently looking and listening to the diseased, who strive in vain to lift their forms. Two sit propped against each other, ""as two brazen pans Set to retain the heat."" From head to foot, a tetter barks them round. Each quickly plies his keen nails due to ""furiousness Of ne’er abated pruriency,"" drawing crust from underneath in flakes.
Virgil asks one, who is rending off his ""coat of proof"" with his fingers, if any Latian is among them, wishing his nails serve him forever. The spirit, weeping, replies that both are of Latium, then asks who Virgil is. Virgil replies he descends with the narrator, who lives, to show him hell's abyss.
They start asunder and turn trembling toward them. Virgil tells the narrator to speak. The narrator asks who they are and their race, hoping their ""unseemly and disgustful"" punishment will not deter them.
One answers, ""Arezzo was my dwelling, And me Albero of Sienna brought To die by fire; but that, for which I died, Leads me not here. True is in sport I told him, That I had learn’d to wing my flight in air. And he admiring much, as he was void Of wisdom, will’d me to declare to him The secret of mine art: and only hence, Because I made him not a Daedalus, Prevail’d on one suppos’d his sire to burn me. But Minos to this chasm last of the ten, For that I practis’d alchemy on earth, Has doom’d me. Him no subterfuge eludes.""
The narrator asks Virgil if any race is as light as Sienna's. The other leprous spirit hears and replies, ""Be Stricca from this charge Exempted, he who knew so temp’rately To lay out fortune’s gifts; and Niccolo Who first the spice’s costly luxury Discover’d in that garden, where such seed Roots deepest in the soil: and be that troop Exempted, with whom Caccia of Asciano Lavish’d his vineyards and wide-spreading woods, And his rare wisdom Abbagliato show’d A spectacle for all."" He then tells the narrator to bend his sight to see his face, so he will know he is Capocchio's ghost, who forged transmuted metals by alchemy, and will remember how he aped ""Creative nature by my subtle art.""

**CANTO XXX**
The narrator describes the frenzies of Athamas (who killed his son Learchus) and Hecuba (who barked like a dog after seeing Polyxena and Polydorus slain), stating that the Furies were never seen with such cruelty as two pale, naked ghosts he now sees. They scamper wildly like swine. One reaches Capocchio, sticks his fangs in his neck-joint, and drags him, his belly rubbing the pavement. The other ghost, from Arezzo, left trembling, says, ""That sprite of air is Schicchi; in like mood Of random mischief vents he still his spite.""
The narrator asks who the other spirit is. The trembling spirit replies, ""That is the ancient soul Of wretched Myrrha... who burn’d With most unholy flame for her own sire, And a false shape assuming, so perform’d The deed of sin."" He adds that the other spirit, passing onward, ""dar’d to counterfeit Donati’s features, to feign’d testament The seal affixing, that himself might gain, For his own share, the lady of the herd.""
The two furious shades vanish. The narrator turns to other cursed spirits. He sees one ""In fashion like a lute, had but the groin Been sever’d."" Swollen with dropsy, his limbs disproportionate, his paunch not suiting his visage, he gasps with wide lips. He addresses the narrator, asking him to regard ""Adamo’s woe."" He says he never lacked what he coveted in life, but now craves ""One drop of water."" The rills of Casentino are ever in his view, and their ""pictur’d semblance dries me up"" more than his disease. Justice urges him to quicken his sighs. He states he falsified metal with the Baptist's form in Romena, for which his body was burnt on earth. He wishes to see the sorrowing souls of Guido, Alessandro, or their brother, which he would not exchange for Branda's spring. He says one is within if mad spirits tell truly, but his limbs are fettered. If he were light enough to move an inch every hundred years, he would seek him out. These spirits brought him down here, inducing him to stamp florens with three carats of alloy.
The narrator asks about ""that abject pair"" bounding him on his right, smoking like a band in a chill stream. Adamo replies he found them there when he dropped into the gulf, and they will not turn till time runs its course. One is ""that dame The false accuser of the Hebrew youth"" (Potiphar's wife, though not named), and the other is Sinon, ""that false Greek from Troy."" Sharp fever drains their moisture, steaming up in a cloud.
One of them, galled by being darkly named, smites Adamo on his paunch, which resounds like a drum. Adamo smites him back on the face. Adamo says, though his limbs are heavy, he has an arm for such employ. Sinon replies he did not have it so ready when he went to the fire, but readier when he coined ""th’ impostor gold."" Adamo replies, ""Ay, now speak’st thou true. But there thou gav’st not such true testimony, When thou wast question’d of the truth, at Troy."" Sinon replies, ""If I spake false, thou falsely stamp’dst the coin... I am here but for one fault, And thou for more than any imp beside."" Adamo retorts, ""Remember... The horse remember, that did teem with death, And all the world be witness to thy guilt."" Sinon returns, ""To thine... witness the thirst Whence thy tongue cracks, witness the fluid mound, Rear’d by thy belly up before thine eyes, A mass corrupt."" Adamo replies, ""Thy mouth gapes wide as ever to let pass Its evil saying. Me if thirst assails, Yet I am stuff’d with moisture. Thou art parch’d, Pains rack thy head, no urging would’st thou need To make thee lap Narcissus’ mirror up.""
The narrator is fixed to listen. Virgil admonishes him, ""Now beware: a little more, And I do quarrel with thee."" The narrator perceives Virgil's anger and turns with poignant shame. He feels like one who dreams of harm and wishes it were a dream, wanting to excuse himself but unable to speak. Virgil says, ""More grievous fault than thine has been, less shame... might expiate. Therefore cast All sorrow from thy soul; and if again Chance bring thee, where like conference is held, Think I am ever at thy side. To hear Such wrangling is a joy for vulgar minds.""

**CANTO XXXI**
The same tongue that reproved the narrator now ministers his cure, like Achilles' javelin. They turn their back on the ""vale of woe"" and cross the mound in silence. In the dim twilight, the narrator hears a horn sounded aloud, whose peal makes thunder feeble. Following its course, his eyes are bent on that spot. He thinks Orlando did not blow such a blast.
He raises his head and sees many lofty towers. He asks Virgil what land this is. Virgil replies that his eye has too long a space of darkness to traverse, so he has erred in imagining. He will see how distance can delude the sense and urges him on.
Virgil tenderly catches his hand and explains that these are not towers but ""giants,"" immersed in the pit from their navel downward, around the bank. As a fog disperses, the narrator's error flees, and fear comes over him. Like Montereggion crowned with turrets, the shore is ""turreted with giants,"" half their length rearing up, horrible.
He discerns the face, shoulders, breast, and much of the huge belly, and both arms of one giant. He notes nature's wisdom in framing these monsters for ""mad War,"" and if she repents not the elephant and whale, she is wiser, for ""when brute force And evil will are back’d with subtlety, Resistance none avails."" This giant's visage is as long and bulky as the pine that tops St. Peter's Roman fane. His stature is so great that three Friezelanders could not reach his hair. He is exposed ""Full thirty ample palms"" downward.
The giant shouts, ""Raphel bai ameth sabi almi."" Virgil addresses him, ""O senseless spirit! let thy horn for thee Interpret: therewith vent thy rage... Search thy neck, There shalt thou find the belt that binds it on. Wild spirit! lo, upon thy mighty breast Where hangs the baldrick!"" Virgil then tells the narrator, ""He doth accuse himself. Nimrod is this, Through whose ill counsel in the world no more One tongue prevails. But pass we on, nor waste Our words; for so each language is to him, As his to others, understood by none.""
They turn left and speed forth, finding another shade ""Far fiercer and more huge"" at a sling's throw. The narrator cannot say what hand girded him, but he holds his right arm fettered behind and the other with a chain from neck down, meeting five times around his form. Virgil says, ""This proud one Would of his strength against almighty Jove Make trial... Ephialtes him they call."" He notes Ephialtes' prowess when giants brought fear on the gods, but now he moves those arms never.
The narrator wishes to see Briareus. Virgil replies that not far from hence they will see Antaeus, who speaks and is unfettered, and will place them where guilt is at its depth. Briareus, whom he wishes to see, stands further on, in chains, and seems more fell. Ephialtes shakes like a tower rocked by an earthquake. The narrator fears death, but the cords holding him fast reassure him.
They journey on to Antaeus, who issues from the cave ""five ells complete Without the head."" Virgil addresses Antaeus, recalling his strength in the fortunate vale where Scipio triumphed over Hannibal, and how he carried a hundred lions as spoil. He asks Antaeus to place them down where ""numbing cold Locks up Cocytus,"" not forcing them to crave Tityus' or Typhon's help, as the narrator can bestow renown on him in the upper world.
Antaeus stretches his hands and catches Virgil. Virgil tells the narrator to clasp him, then catches him up so they are ""both one burden."" Antaeus seems like the leaning tower of Carisenda. The narrator wishes he could have passed another way. Antaeus lightly places them in the abyss, where Lucifer ingulfs Judas, then rises like a mast.

**CANTO XXXII**
The narrator wishes for ""rough rhimes and hoarse"" to suit this ""hole of sorrow,"" as describing the depth of the universe is no jest. He invokes the Muses. He laments the ill-starred folk, wretched beyond others.
They stand in the dark pit beneath the giants' feet, but lower. A voice tells the narrator, ""Look how thou walkest. Take Good heed, thy soles do tread not on the heads Of thy poor brethren."" He turns and sees a lake whose frozen surface seems more like glass than water, thicker than the Danube or Tanais in winter. If Tabernich or Pietrapana fell on it, not even its rim would creak. Like frogs croaking above the wave, the spirits stand ""Blue pinch’d and shrin’d in ice,"" moving their teeth like storks. Their faces are held downward, their mouths cold, their eyes expressing dolour.
The narrator sees two spirits so strictly joined that their hairs are mingled. He asks who they are. They bend their necks, and their eyes, moist within, distill tears onto their lips, which the frost binds. They clash together like enraged goats.
One, from whom the cold has reft both ears, exclaims, ""Why on us Dost speculate so long? If thou wouldst know Who are these two, the valley, whence his wave Bisenzio slopes, did for its master own Their sire Alberto, and next him themselves."" They issued from one body, and in Caina, one would not find a shade more worthy of congealment, not even him whose breast and shadow Arthur's land dissevered, nor Focaccia, nor the spirit whose head obstructs his view (Mascheroni). He reveals his own name was Camiccione and he awaits his kinsman Carlino, whose deep guilt will wash out his own.
The narrator then marks a thousand visages shaped into a ""doggish grin"" by the cold, causing a shivering horror. As they journey toward the middle, where all heavy substance unites, the narrator, trembling, accidentally strikes the face of one spirit.
The spirit, weeping, exclaims, ""Wherefore dost bruise me? Unless thy errand be some fresh revenge For Montaperto, wherefore troublest me?"" The narrator asks Virgil to wait so he can rid himself of doubt. Virgil pauses. The narrator asks the spirit, who curses him, who he is. The spirit asks who the narrator is, roaming through Antenora and striking others' cheeks with such force.
The narrator replies he is living, hoping fame is dear to the spirit, so he can enroll his name. The spirit says the narrator offers the contrary of what he covets most and tells him to vex him no more. The narrator seizes his ""hinder scalp,"" crying, ""Name thee, or not a hair shall tarry here."" The spirit replies, ""Rend all away... yet for that I will not tell nor show thee who I am.""
The narrator grasps his tresses and strips off more than one tuft, the spirit barking. Another cries, ""What ails thee, Bocca? Sound not loud enough Thy chatt’ring teeth, but thou must bark outright? What devil wrings thee?"" The narrator tells the ""Accursed traitor"" (Bocca) to be dumb, as he will bear true tidings of him. Bocca replies to tell what he lists, but to speak of ""him whose tongue hath been so glib"" (Buoso da Duera) who wails for the Frenchman's gold. He adds that Beccaria, whose red gorge was stained by Florence's axe, is at his side. Further on, Soldanieri, Ganellon, and Tribaldello (who opened Faenza) bide.
They leave him and see two spirits pent in one hollow by the ice, one's head serving as a cowl for the other. The uppermost applies his fangs to the other's brain, where the spine joins it, more furiously than Tydeus gnawed Menalippus'. The narrator asks the cause of such hate, promising to repay him in the world above if his grievance is warranted.

**CANTO XXXIII**
The sinner lifts his jaws from his repast, wipes them on the mangled hairs of the head, and begins: ""Thy will obeying, I call up afresh Sorrow past cure, which but to think of wrings My heart, or ere I tell on’t. But if words... shall prove seed to bear Fruit of eternal infamy to him, The traitor whom I gnaw at, thou at once Shalt see me speak and weep."" He says he does not know who the narrator is or how he came, but he seems Florentine. He reveals he was Count Ugolino, and the archbishop he gnaws is Ruggieri. He explains that through Ruggieri's ill thoughts, reposing trust in him, he was taken and murdered. He will tell what the narrator cannot have heard: how cruel the murder was.
He describes a ""small grate Within that mew, which for my sake the name Of famine bears,"" where others must pine. Several moons had shown through its opening when he slept an ""evil sleep,"" which tore the curtain off the future. He dreamed Ruggieri, as master of the sport, rode forth to chase the gaunt wolf and his whelps (Ugolino and his sons) to the mountain that forbids the sight of Lucca to the Pisan. Lanfranchi, Sismondi, and Gualandi were ranged before him with lean brachs. After a short course, the father and sons seemed tired, and he saw sharp tusks gore their sides.
He awoke before dawn, hearing his sons (who were with him) weep and ask for bread. He calls the narrator cruel if he feels no pang. They had awakened, and the hour for food drew near. Each son had misgivings from his dream. He heard the horrible tower locked up from its outlet. He looked at his sons' visages, weeping not, feeling ""all stone within."" They wept, and his little Anslem cried, ""Thou lookest so! Father what ails thee?"" He shed no tear, nor answered all that day or the next night.
When a faint beam made its way to their prison, and he descried his own image in four countenances, he bit his hands through agony. His sons, thinking he did it from hunger, rose and cried, ""Father, we should grieve Far less, if thou wouldst eat of us: thou gav’st These weeds of miserable flesh we wear, And do thou strip them off from us again."" To avoid making them sadder, he kept his spirit still. That day and the next, they were silent. He laments, ""Ah, obdurate earth! Why open’dst not upon us?"" On the fourth day, Geddo flung himself at his feet, crying, ""Hast no help For me, my father!"" There he died. Ugolino saw the three fall one by one between the fifth and sixth day. Then, grown blind, he groped over them for three days, calling on them, then ""fasting got The mastery of grief.""
Having spoken, he fastens his teeth once more on the wretched skull. The narrator then curses Pisa, calling it a shame to all people, wishing Capraia and Gorgona would rise and dam up the Arno's mouth so every soul in Pisa might perish. He argues that even if Ugolino betrayed castles, Pisa had no right to rack his children, as Brigata, Ugaccione, and the two gentle ones were ""Uncapable of guilt"" due to their tender years.
They pass onward, where others are ""skarf’d in rugged folds of ice,"" reversed, not on their feet. Here, ""weeping suffers not to weep,"" as grief finds impediment at their eyes, rolling inward for increased anguish. The first tears hang clustered like crystal visors.
Though the cold has dislodged all feeling from his face, the narrator feels a breath of wind. He asks Virgil whence it comes, as he thought all vapor was quenched below. Virgil replies he will soon see the cause of this ""airy shower.""
One spirit in the chill crust cries out, ""O souls so cruel! that the farthest post Hath been assign’d you, from this face remove The harden’d veil, that I may vent the grief Impregnate at my heart, some little space Ere it congeal again!"" The narrator replies he will aid him if he reveals who he was, promising to descend to the lowest ice if he fails.
The spirit answers, ""The friar Alberigo Am I, who from the evil garden pluck’d Its fruitage, and am here repaid, the date More luscious for my fig."" The narrator exclaims, ""Hah! Art thou too dead!"" Alberigo replies he is ignorant of how his body fares in the world above. He explains that ""Ptolomea"" has the privilege that the soul drops here before Atropos divorces it. To make the narrator wipe his glazed tear-drops, he says that the moment a soul betrays, as he did, it yields its body to a fiend who moves and governs it until its time is rounded, and the soul falls to this cistern. He says the body of a ghost who winters behind him might still appear above, and the narrator knows him if he is newly arrived. Many years have passed since Branca Doria came to this fastness.
The narrator replies he thinks Alberigo mocks him, as Branca Doria has not died but performs all natural functions. Alberigo replies that Michael Zanche had not yet reached the ""upper foss"" where pitch boils when Branca Doria left a demon in his stead in his own body, and one of his kin who wrought treachery with him did the same. He asks the narrator to open his eyes. The narrator refuses, deeming ""Ill manners were best courtesy to him.""
The narrator then curses the Genoese, asking why they are not canceled from earth, as he found one of them with Romagna's darkest spirit, whose soul is plunged in Cocytus even now, yet seems alive in body on earth.

**CANTO XXXIV**
Virgil says, ""The banners of Hell’s Monarch do come forth Towards us; therefore look... If thou discern him."" As a windmill appears from afar through a dense cloud, such was the ""fabric"" the narrator thought he saw. He draws behind Virgil to shield himself from the wind.
The narrator comes to a place where souls are whelmed underneath, transparent like glass. Some are prone, others upright, some on their soles, some on their heads, a third arched like a bow. When they reach the point where Virgil wishes him to see the ""creature eminent in beauty once,"" Virgil steps before him and makes him pause.
Virgil exclaims, ""Lo! lo! Dis! and lo the place, Where thou hast need to arm thy heart with strength."" The narrator becomes frozen and faint, unable to describe his state. He says he was ""not dead nor living.""
That ""emperor, who sways The realm of sorrow"" (Lucifer), stands forth from the ice mid-breast. The narrator is more like a giant compared to the giants in Lucifer's arms. He notes the immense size of the whole. If Lucifer were as beautiful as he is hideous now, and dared to scowl at his Maker, all misery might flow from him.
Lucifer has ""three faces"": one in front, vermilion; the other two joined midway each shoulder and at the crest. The right face seems ""’twixt wan and yellow,"" the left ""such as come from whence old Nile Stoops to the lowlands."" Under each face shoot forth ""Two mighty wings, enormous as became A bird so vast."" They have no plumes but are like a bat's texture. He flaps them, creating ""three winds, wherewith Cocytus to its depth Was frozen."" He weeps from six eyes, tears distilling down three chins with bloody foam. At every mouth, his teeth champ a sinner, bruised as with a ponderous engine, so three are tormented. But the foremost sinner is ""far more Than from that gnawing... pang’d By the fierce rending, whence ofttimes the back Was stript of all its skin.""
Virgil explains that the ""upper spirit, Who hath worse punishment,"" is Judas, with his head within and feet without. Of the other two, whose heads are under, the one hanging from the murky jaw is Brutus, who writhes and speaks not. The other is Cassius, ""large of limb."" Virgil states that night re-ascends, and it is time for parting, as ""All is seen.""
The narrator clips Virgil around the neck as bidden. Virgil, noting time and place, catches fast the shaggy sides when the wings are open enough, and steps down ""from pile to pile... Between the thick fell and the jagged ice.""
When he reaches the point where the thigh turns on the haunches' swelling, Virgil, with pain and struggle, turns his head where his feet stood before and grapples at the fell, ""as one who mounts,"" making the narrator think they are turning into hell again.
Virgil, panting, says, ""Expect that by such stairs as these... We must depart from evil so extreme."" He issues forth at a rocky opening and places the narrator on a brink to sit, then joins his side. The narrator raises his eyes, expecting to see Lucifer where he was left, but now sees him ""With legs held upward."" He asks the ""grosser sort"" to consider if he was toiled.
Virgil cries, ""Arise... upon thy feet. The way is long, and much uncouth the road; And now within one hour and half of noon The sun returns."" They are in a natural dungeon with ill footing and scant light. The narrator asks Virgil, before they separate, to free him from error. He asks, ""Where is now the ice? How standeth he in posture thus revers’d? And how from eve to morn in space so brief Hath the sun made his transit?""
Virgil replies that the narrator deems he is still on the other side of the center where he grasped the ""abhorred worm."" He was on the other side as Virgil descended; when Virgil turned, the narrator ""didst o’erpass That point, to which from ev’ry part is dragg’d All heavy substance."" He is now under the hemisphere opposed to the great continent, and under whose canopy ""The Man, that was born sinless, and so liv’d"" expired. His feet are planted on the smallest sphere, whose other aspect is Judecca. Morning rises here when evening sets there. Lucifer, whose ""shaggy pile was scal’d,"" still stands fixed as at first. He fell down from heaven on this part, and the earth, prominent before, veiled herself with the sea through fear of him, retiring to their hemisphere. Perhaps the vacant space here was left by the firm land that sprang aloof to shun him.
Beneath, a place exists, distant from Beelzebub, discovered not by sight but by the sound of a brooklet descending through a rock, which the wave has eaten. By that hidden way, Virgil and the narrator enter to return to the ""fair world."" Heedless of repose, they climb, Virgil first, then the narrator, until the ""beautiful lights of heav’n Dawn’d through a circular opening in the cave: Thus issuing we again beheld the stars.""

**PURGATORY**

**CANTO I**
The narrator's ""light bark of my genius"" now lifts its sail ""O’er better waves,"" pleased to leave the cruel sea of Hell behind. He will sing of the ""second region,"" where the human spirit is purged of sin and prepares for Heaven. He invokes the Muses, especially Calliope, to aid his song.
A ""sweet hue of eastern sapphire"" spreads over the serene, pure air, renewing his joy after escaping the ""deadly gloom"" of Hell. The sun, the ""radiant planet, that to love invites,"" makes the orient laugh, veiled beneath the light of Pisces.
He turns to the right and fixes his mind on the other pole, where he sees ""Four stars ne’er seen before save by the ken Of our first parents."" Heaven seems joyous from their rays. He laments the northern site, bereft and widowed without these stars.
As he ceases gazing, an old man stands by his side, alone, worthy of reverence. His beard and locks, mixed with hoary white, descend in a double fold upon his breast. The beams of the four luminaries shine brightly on his face, making him appear like the sun.
The old man asks, ""Say who are ye, that stemming the blind stream, Forth from th’ eternal prison-house have fled?"" He asks who conducted them or lit their way from the ""depth of night"" that makes the infernal valley black. He questions if the ""firm statutes of the dread abyss"" are broken or if new laws are ordained in heaven for them to approach his caves.
Virgil, laying hold of the narrator, makes him pay reverence with bent knees and submissive eye. Virgil replies that he does not come of himself, but a ""Dame from heaven"" (Beatrice) asked him to bring the narrator. He explains that the narrator, a mortal, never saw the ""farthest gloom"" but erred by folly and came so near perdition that little space was left to turn. Virgil was dispatched to rescue him, and this was the only way. He has shown the narrator all the regions of the bad and now intends to show the spirits purged from sin under the old man's command. He says ""From high descends the virtue, by whose aid I to thy sight and hearing him have led."" He hopes their coming pleases him, as the narrator journeys ""In the search Of liberty,"" which is dear to those who refused life for it. He acknowledges the old man (Cato) knows this, having found death sweet in Utica, where he left his ""weeds"" (body) that will shine bright on the last day. Virgil assures him the ""eternal edicts are unmov’d,"" the narrator breathes, and he (Virgil) is free of Minos' power, abiding in the circle where Cato's ""chaste Marcia"" beams, praying him to own her. Virgil implores Cato by Marcia's love to let them pass through his ""sev’n regions,"" promising to thank Marcia if Cato does not disdain mention of her below.
Cato replies that Marcia was pleasing to his sight while he was there, and he granted all she asked. But now that she dwells beyond the ""accursed stream,"" she can no longer move him by the law ordained when he issued thence. However, if a ""Dame from heaven"" directs Virgil, no flattery is needed; her name is enough. He instructs them to go and ""with a slender reed See that thou duly gird him, and his face Lave, till all sordid stain thou wipe from thence."" He says it would not be seemly for the narrator to come before the ""foremost minister in heaven"" with eyes obscured. He explains that the islet produces reeds on its oozy bed, and no other plant lives there. He tells them not to return this way but to let the rising sun show them the easiest ascent of the mountain.
Cato disappears. The narrator rises, speechless, and turns to Virgil, who tells him to follow his steps, as they must retreat backward, for that way the ""champain to its low extreme declines.""
Dawn has chased the morning prime. The narrator spies the trembling of the ocean stream. They traverse the deserted plain like one who, lost, thinks every step is in vain until he regains the path.
When they reach a place where the tender dew still strives with the sun and the wind breathes fresh, Virgil places both hands on the watery grass. The narrator, aware of his intent, stretches out his tear-suffused cheeks. Virgil restores the hue that Hell's shades concealed. Then, on the solitary shore, Virgil girds him as instructed. The narrator notes, strangely, that as Virgil plucks each humble reed, another resembling it immediately arises in its place.

**CANTO II**
The sun has reached the horizon that covers Salem's walls, and night, opposite to the sun, has issued from the Ganges, holding the scales that drop when she reigns highest. Where the narrator is, Aurora's cheek has turned to orange.
They linger by the water's brink, like men musing on their road. As Mars glares with fiery beam over the ocean floor near dawn, a light comes swiftly through the sea, no winged course equaling its career. The narrator withdraws his eyes to inquire of Virgil, then looks again and sees it grown in size and brightness. Something bright appears on either side, and then another from underneath. Virgil stands silent. The brightness reveals wings. Virgil, recognizing the pilot, cries, ""Down, down; bend low Thy knees; behold God’s angel: fold thy hands: Now shalt thou see true Ministers indeed.""
Virgil notes how the angel sets human means at naught, needing no oar or sail but his wings. He holds them straight up to heaven, winnowing the air with ""eternal plumes.""
As the ""bird of God"" comes nearer, he appears brighter, his splendor unbearable to the eye. The narrator bends his eyes down. The angel drives ashore in a small, swift, light bark. The ""heav’nly steersman"" is seen at the prow, ""Visibly written blessed in his looks.""
Within the bark sit ""a hundred spirits and more."" They all sing ""In Exitu Israel de Aegypto"" with one voice. As soon as the angel blesses them with the sign of the cross, they leap out on land. The angel returns swiftly as he came. The crew, left astounded, gaze around.
The sun darts its beams from every side. The strange tribe, lifting their eyes, ask, ""If ye know, Declare what path will Lead us to the mount."" Virgil replies they are strangers here, having come by another, rougher road. The spirits, perceiving the narrator is alive from his breathing, grow pale with wonder. Like a multitude flocking to a herald, they fix on the narrator, forgetting their errand.
One spirit darts before the rest with fond ardor to embrace the narrator. The narrator tries to embrace him thrice, but his hands return empty. The shadow smiles and draws back. The narrator hastens to follow, but the spirit enjoins him to desist with a sweet voice. The narrator recognizes him as Casella and asks him to pause and talk.
Casella replies he loves the narrator as in his mortal frame and still loves him, pausing for him. He asks why the narrator walks there. The narrator replies he journeys to return to a better life, asking how Casella lost so much time. Casella answers that the one who ""when and whom he chooses takes"" has often denied him passage, as his will is just. He says that three months past, the angel took those he chose, and Casella gained ""kind Admittance"" at the Tiber's mouth, where the angel points his wings, for ""there always throng All such as not to Archeron descend.""
The narrator asks if new laws have not destroyed the memory of a ""sweet song of love"" that used to assuage his cares, asking Casella to console his spirit, overcome by travel. Casella then begins to sing ""Love that discourses in my thoughts"" in such soft accents that the sweetness still thrills the narrator. Virgil and all the spirits are so pleased that nothing else seems to occupy their thoughts.
They stand fixed in mute attention. The venerable old man (Cato) exclaims, ""How is this, ye tardy spirits? What negligence detains you loit’ring here? Run to the mountain to cast off those scales, That from your eyes the sight of God conceal."" Like a flock of pigeons suddenly alarmed, the new-come troop deserts the song and hastens to the mountain's side. The narrator and Virgil depart with no less hurried step.

**CANTO III**
The sudden flight scatters the spirits over the plain toward the mountain. The narrator adheres to Virgil, wondering how he would have fared without him. Virgil seems smitten with ""bitter pang of self-remorse.""
As Virgil's feet cease hastening, the narrator's mind expands with joy. He sets his face against the steep ascent. The sun, flaring behind, is broken by his form. He turns aside, fearing to be left, seeing only the ground obscured before him. Virgil kindly asks why he distrusts, assuring him he is his guide. He explains that it is evening where his body lies buried in Naples, and the narrator should not marvel if no shadow falls before him, just as one ray does not obstruct another in the sky. He says that to endure ""Torments of heat and cold extreme,"" frames are disposed by a virtue whose working God ""Wills not to us should be reveal’d."" He calls insane anyone who hopes reason can explore the space holding ""three persons in one substance knit."" He warns against seeking the ""wherefore,"" reminding them that they have seen men desiring fruitlessly (Plato, Stagyrite, and others), whose desires now serve for eternal grief. Virgil then bends his forehead and breaks off his speech in troubled mood.
They reach the mountain's foot, finding the rock so steep that even the nimblest steps would be vain. Virgil asks, ""Who knows on which hand now the steep declines... so that he may Ascend, who journeys without aid of wine?"" As he explores the pathway, the narrator gazes upward and sees spirits moving toward them, yet seeming not to move, so slow is their approach.
The narrator tells Virgil to raise his eyes, as some spirits might offer counsel. Virgil looks and replies, ""Let us tend thither: they but softly come. And thou be firm in hope, my son belov’d.""
The spirits are a thousand paces distant when they draw backward on the crags and stand unmoved, like one walking in doubt. Virgil addresses them, ""O spirits perfect! O already chosen!... Instruct us where the mountain low declines, So that attempt to mount it be not vain. For who knows most, him loss of time most grieves.""
Like sheep stepping from their fold, one by one or in small groups, while the rest stand fearfully, the first of the fortunate crew move to advance, with modest mien. When they see the light from the narrator's right side fall broken on the ground, casting a shadow, they stop and retire. All who follow do the same, unaware of the cause.
Virgil confesses that the narrator is a human body and that the sun's light is broken by him. He tells them not to marvel but to believe that they aspire to climb ""Over this wall"" not without ""Virtue deriv’d from Heaven."" The virtuous tribe replies, ""Turn, and before you there the entrance lies,"" signaling with bent hands.
One spirit begins, asking the narrator to turn his visage and think if he has ever seen him elsewhere. The narrator turns and beholds a comely, fair, gentle spirit, but with a gash marked on one brow. The narrator humbly disclaims ever seeing him. The spirit says, ""Now behold!"" and shows a wound high on his breast, then smiling, speaks.
He identifies himself as Manfredi, grandson to Queen Costanza. He asks the narrator, when returned, to go to his ""fair daughter"" (parent of Aragon and Sicily's pride) and inform her of the truth, if anything else is told of him. He says that when his frame was shattered by two mortal blows, he betook himself weeping to God, ""who of free will forgives."" His sins were horrible, but ""goodness infinite"" receives all who turn to it. He believes if ""Cosenza’s shepherd"" (the Pope's agent) had better scanned this divine text, his bones would have lain near Benevento, protected. Instead, rain drenches them and wind drives them ""out of the kingdom’s bounds, Far as the stream of Verde,"" where they were removed with lights extinguished. He says that their curse does not destroy them so much that ""the eternal love may turn, while hope Retains her verdant blossoms."" He states that one who dies in contumacy against the holy church, though repenting, must wander ""thirty-fold for all the time In his presumption past,"" unless prayers of good men shorten it. He asks the narrator to advance his bliss by revealing to Costanza how he beheld him and the terms of the interdict, for ""here By means of those below much profit comes.""

**CANTO IV**
The narrator explains that when any sensation seizes a faculty, the soul collects itself, intent on that power alone, disproving the error that the soul is not singly lighted in the breast. Thus, when something heard or seen firmly turns the soul, time passes unperceived. He found this true, hearing the spirit and wondering, for the sun had measured fifty steps aloft unobserved by him when they arrived where spirits shouted, ""Here is what ye ask.""
A path, narrower than a villager's thorn-forked stake for grapes, is the one by which Virgil and the narrator ascended, solitary after the troop departed. He compares it to the steep roads of Sanleo or Bismantua, requiring flight with ""swift wing and plumes of high desire.""
They ascend through broken rock, close-pent, needing hands and feet. Near the highest ridge, where the plain opens, the narrator exclaims, ""O master! say which way can we proceed?"" Virgil replies, ""Let no step of thine recede. Behind me gain the mountain, till to us Some practis’d guide appear."" The eminence is so lofty no eye can reach its point, and the side rises more steeply than a line from the mid-quadrant to the center.
Wearied, the narrator asks Virgil to turn and behold him, as he remains alone if Virgil does not stay. Virgil replies, ""My son! Thus far put forth thy strength;"" and points to a track that circles the hill. Spurred on, the narrator climbs until his feet press the plain circuit beneath. Seated together, they turn eastward, whence they ascended, a view many have looked back on with delight.
First, the narrator looks at the nether shores, then raises his eyes to the sun, wondering that it smites them from the left. Virgil, perceiving his amazement at the sun's course, explains that if Leda's offspring (Castor and Pollux, constellations) were with the sun, the ""ruddy zodiac"" would wheel nearer the bears. He asks the narrator to imagine Sion and this mount placed on earth with one horizon, and the path Phaeton ill knew. He will see how the sun passes by this (Purgatory) on one side and by that (Jerusalem) on the other.
The narrator exclaims, ""Of truth, kind teacher! so clear Aught saw I never, as I now discern Where seem’d my ken to fail."" He now understands that the ""mid orb Of the supernal motion"" (the Equator) departs toward the north from here when those in the Hebrew land see it toward the warmer part. He asks how far they have to journey, as the hill mounts higher than his sight.
Virgil replies that the ascent is always difficult at first but grows easier. When it seems pleasant, like going down a tide, he will have reached the end. There, he can hope to rest. Virgil says he will answer no more on this.
A voice sounds near, ""Yet ye first perchance May to repose you by constraint be led."" They turn and see a huge stone on the left, unnoticed before. They draw near and find some spirits standing behind the rock, as if idle. One, very wearied, sits down, folding his knees and bending his face between them.
The narrator cries, ""Sweet Sir! behold that man, who shows Himself more idle, than if laziness Were sister to him."" The spirit turns, lifts his face over his thigh, and says, ""Up then, proceed Thou valiant one."" The narrator recognizes Belacqua. Despite his breathlessness, he approaches. Belacqua barely lifts his head, saying, ""Well hast thou discern’d, How from the left the sun his chariot leads.""
Belacqua's lazy acts and broken words make the narrator smile. He says he grieves for Belacqua no more but asks why he is seated there, waiting for escort, or if it's just his accustomed ways. Belacqua replies, ""My brother, of what use to mount, When to my suffering would not let me pass The bird of God, who at the portal sits?"" He says he must wait as long as he delayed repentance in life, unless prayer from a heart in grace aids him first.
Virgil, ascending, cries, ""Haste thee, for see the sun Has touch’d the point meridian, and the night Now covers with her foot Marocco’s shore.""

**CANTO V**
The narrator leaves the spirits and follows Virgil. He hears one spirit exclaim, pointing at him, ""See how it seems as if the light not shone From the left hand of him beneath, and he, As living, seems to be led on."" The narrator turns and sees them gazing in wonder at him and the broken light. Virgil exclaims, ""Why are thy thoughts thus riveted... that thou hast slack’d thy pace? or how Imports it thee, what thing is whisper’d here? Come after me, and to their babblings leave The crowd. Be as a tower, that, firmly set, Shakes not its top for any blast that blows! He, in whose bosom thought on thought shoots out, Still of his aim is wide, in that the one Sicklies and wastes to nought the other’s strength."" The narrator replies, ""I come,"" with a tinge of color that merits pardon.
Meanwhile, some spirits come along the hill, singing ""Miserere."" When they perceive the narrator's body blocks the rays, their song changes to a long, hoarse exclaim. Two run to meet them, asking about their condition. Virgil tells them to return and report that his frame is ""real flesh."" If they paused to view his shade, that is enough answer, and they should honor him.
The spirits return swiftly, like fiery vapors or August clouds. They wheel back on them. Virgil exclaims, ""Many... are these, who throng Around us: to petition thee they come. Go therefore on, and listen as thou go’st.""
The spirits shout, ""O spirit! who go’st on to blessedness With the same limbs, that clad thee at thy birth... a little rest thy step. Look if thou any one amongst our tribe Hast e’er beheld, that tidings of him there Thou mayst report. Ah, wherefore go’st thou on? Ah wherefore tarriest thou not? We all By violence died, and to our latest hour Were sinners, but then warn’d by light from heav’n, So that, repenting and forgiving, we Did issue out of life at peace with God, Who with desire to see him fills our heart.""
The narrator replies he scans their visages but remembers none. He offers to perform any service they wish, by the peace he seeks. One spirit replies none distrusts his kindness. He, speaking first, entreats the narrator, if he ever sees the land between Romagna and Charles's realm, to pray those in Fano to offer adorations for him to purge his sins. He came from there. He says the deep passages where his blood issued were made on his bosom in Antenor's land, where he thought to be more secure. The deed's author was Este's prince, who pursued him with wrath. He says he might have breathed if he had fled toward Mira when overtaken at Oriaco, but he sped to the marsh, fell, and saw his life-blood float the plain.
Another spirit says, ""Ah! so may the wish, That takes thee o’er the mountain, be fulfill’d, As thou shalt graciously give aid to mine. Of Montefeltro I; Buonconte I: Giovanna nor none else have care for me, Sorrowing with these I therefore go."" The narrator asks what force or chance drew him from Campaldino's field, as his sepulture was unknown. Buonconte replies that a stream called Archiano runs at Casentino's foot. He came there, pierced in the heart, fleeing on foot, bloodying the plain. Sight and speech failed him, and finishing with Mary's name, he fell, his flesh tenantless. He will report the truth for the narrator to tell the living. God's angel took him, while the angel of hell exclaimed, ""O thou from heav’n! Say wherefore hast thou robb’d me? Thou of him Th’ eternal portion bear’st with thee away For one poor tear that he deprives me of. But of the other, other rule I make."" He explains that evil will, following evil, raised wind and smoky mist, covering the valley with cloud from Pratomagno to the mountains. The air changed to water, rain fell, and all that the land contained rushed to the fosses and the great river. The Archiano found his ""stiffen’d frame"" at its mouth, dashed it into the Arno, loosening the cross he made when overcome with pain, then wrapped him in its muddy spoils.
A third spirit speaks, ""Ah! when thou to the world shalt be return’d, And rested after thy long road... then remember me. I once was Pia. Sienna gave me life, Maremma took it from me. That he knows, Who me with jewell’d ring had first espous’d.""

**CANTO VI**
The narrator describes how men separate from a game of dice: the loser remains sad, while the company goes with the winner, one running before, one twitching his mantle, one asking to be remembered. The winner stops not, but bids each aside. The narrator was like this, escaping the throng with pain by turning his face and promising.
He saw him of Arezzo, who fell by Ghino's arm, and him swallowed by the stream in his chase. Frederic Novello entreated with outstretched hand. He saw the Pisan who tested Marzuco's constancy. He beheld Count Orso. He saw a soul dismissed from its frame for spite and envy, not crime, Peter de la Brosse, and warns the Lady of Brabant to beware lest she herd with worse.
Freed from these spirits praying for others' prayers, the narrator asks Virgil why his text denies that heaven's decree can bend to supplication, yet these entreat. He asks if their hope is vain. Virgil replies that both his writing is plain and their hope is not deceived if the narrator considers that ""the sacred height Of judgment doth not stoop, because love’s flame In a short moment all fulfils, which he Who sojourns here, in right should satisfy."" He adds that in his time, prayer had no access to God. He tells the narrator not to rest content unless Beatrice assures him, as she infuses light between truth and mind. He says Beatrice is above, on the mountain's crown.
The narrator asks to mend their speed, as he is not tired and the hill stretches its shadow far. Virgil replies their progress will be as much as they can dispatch that day, but the truth is otherwise. He says the narrator cannot be there until he sees the sun return, which is now hidden behind the steep. He points out a solitary spirit looking at them, who will instruct them.
They approach the spirit. The narrator notes his ""high abstracted mood,"" scarce moving his eyes. It speaks not, but eyes them like a lion on watch. Virgil asks it to show the best ascent. It returns no answer but asks of their country and life. When Virgil begins, ""Mantua,"" the solitary shadow quickly rises and cries, ""Mantuan! I am thy countryman Sordello."" Each embraces the other.
The narrator then laments ""slavish Italy!"" calling her an inn of grief, a vessel without a pilot, no longer lady of provinces but a brothel. He notes Sordello's glad cheer at the sound of his dear land, while Italy's living ones war among themselves, even those within the same walls. He urges Italy to look around her coasts and within her bosom to see if any part enjoys peace. He questions the use of Justinian's laws if her saddle is unpressed, saying it only aggravates her shame. He says the people should obey and let Caesar sit in the saddle. He blames ""German Albert"" for abandoning Italy, which has grown savage, and calls for ""Just judgment from the stars"" to fall on his blood and strike his successor with dread, because Albert and his father, detained by greed for other realms, allowed the ""garden of the empire"" to run waste.
He urges Albert to ""Come see the Capulets and Montagues, The Philippeschi and Monaldi!"" and behold the oppression of nobles and their injuries, and what safety Santafiore can supply. He calls on Albert to see Rome, a ""Desolate widow!"" crying day and night, ""My Caesar, why dost thou desert my side?"" He asks him to behold the love among his people and to blush for his own report.
The narrator then asks if it is lawful for him to question ""Almighty Power"" why His just eyes are turned elsewhere, or if this is a preparation for some good end cut off from human thought. He notes that Italian cities are ""o’erthrong’d With tyrants,"" and every villager is a ""great Marcellus."" He addresses Florence, saying she may remain unmoved by this digression, thanks to her people who ""so wisely speed."" He notes many have justice in their heart but wait for counsel, while Florence's people answer uncalled, crying, ""Behold I stoop!"" He ironically tells Florence to be glad, for she is wealthy, at peace, and wisdom-fraught, and facts will witness if he speaks truth. He says Athens and Lacedaemon made little progress compared to Florence, who uses such ""nice subtlety"" that she weaves a thread in October that scarce reaches mid-November. He asks how many times Florence has renewed customs, laws, coins, and offices, and changed people. If she remembers well, she will perceive herself like a sick wretch, shifting sides for short respite from pain.

**CANTO VII**
After seven joyful greetings, Sordello draws back, exclaiming, ""Who are ye?"" Virgil replies that his bones were buried by Octavius before this mount was sought by spirits. He is Virgil, deprived of heaven only for ""lack of faith."" Sordello appears to waver in belief, then bends his eyes, approaches reverentially, and clasps Virgil. He exclaims, ""Glory of Latium! In whom our tongue its utmost power display’d! Boast of my honor’d birth-place! what desert Of mine, what favour rather undeserv’d, Shows thee to me? If I to hear that voice Am worthy, say if from below thou com’st And from what cloister’s pale?""
Virgil replies that he has arrived through every orb of that sad region, led by heavenly influence. He describes a place below, not made by torments but by ""dun shades alone,"" where mourning breathes in sighs, not anguish. There he abides with ""little innocents"" bitten by death's fangs before being exempt from human taint, and with those who did not put on the ""three holy virtues"" but understood and followed the rest without blame. He asks Sordello to direct them to where Purgatory truly begins.
Sordello replies they have no certain place assigned, and he can go up or around, joining them as guide. But he notes day declines, and they cannot ascend by night. He suggests choosing a ""place of pleasant sojourn,"" where some spirits sit apart to the right, whom they will know with delight. Virgil asks why ascending by night is impossible. Sordello, trailing his finger on the ground, says, ""Only this line Thou shalt not overpass, soon as the sun Hath disappear’d; not that aught else impedes Thy going upwards, save the shades of night. These with the wont of power perplex the will."" He warns they might return beneath or wander around the mountain if they try.
Virgil, wondering, asks Sordello to lead them quickly to the delightful place. They move a little space, and the narrator perceives the mountain hollowed out like large valleys. Sordello says they go ""Where in a bosom the high bank recedes,"" and they must await the renewal of day.
A crooked path leads them between the steep and plain into the ridge's side. Refulgent gold, silver, scarlet grain, ceruse, Indian wood, and fresh emeralds surpass the herbs and flowers in color. Nature not only lavishes hues but creates a rare fragrance from a thousand smells.
The narrator sees spirits sitting on the grass and flowers, chanting ""Salve Regina."" Virgil tells him not to desire to be led on among them before sunset, as from this eminence, they will better discern the acts and visages of all.
He points out the one sitting highest, who seems to have neglected his duty and moves not his lip to the others' song: Emperor Rodolph, who might have healed Italy's wounds. The one comforting him with a kindly visage is Ottocar, who swayed the country where the Moldaw springs. Ottocar was worth more in his swaddling clothes than his son Winceslaus, a bearded man pampered with luxury. The one with the ""nose depress,"" counseling with the gentle-looking one, expired flying, withering the lily's flower. He knocks against his breast. The other, making a couch for his cheek with his hand, sighs frequently. These are the father and father-in-law of ""Gallia’s bane,"" grieving for his vicious life.
He points out one ""so robust of limb,"" who keeps measure in song, with him of prominent feature, both braced with every virtue. If the stripling behind him had lived as king, his virtue would have poured into him, which cannot be said of the other heirs. James and Frederick hold his realms, neither obtaining the better heritage. Human worth rarely mounts the branches of the tree, as God ordains it as his free gift. Virgil's words apply to Charles no less than his brother, which Pouille and Provence now confess with grief, as that plant degenerates from its seed. Costanza still boasts of her valorous spouse more than Beatrice and Margaret.
He points out ""the king of simple life and plain, Harry of England, sitting there alone,"" who spreads better issue through his branches. The one sitting lowest, yet gazing aloft, is William, the brave Marquis, for whose cause Alexandria's deed and his war make Conferrat and Canavese weep.

**CANTO VIII**
It is the hour that wakens fond desire in men at sea and pilgrims, making them mourn for the expiring day. The narrator, no longer listening, sees one spirit rise from its seat, imploring audience with its hand. It joins both palms and raises them, fixing its gaze eastward, as if telling God, ""I care for naught beside."" ""Te Lucis Ante"" comes from its lip in such a soft strain that the narrator's sense is lost. The rest follow devoutly through the hymn, gazing upward at the ""bright supernal wheels.""
The narrator urges the reader to make his eyes keen, for the veil is subtle. He sees the gentle band silently look up, pale and lowly, as if in expectation. From on high, he sees two angels descend, with ""flame-illumin’d swords, Broken and mutilated at their points."" Their vesture is green as new leaves, beaten by green wings. One stands a little over them, the other on the opposing hill, so the troop is contained in the middle. The narrator discerns the whiteness on their heads but their faces are lost to his dazzled eye. Sordello exclaims that both are from Mary's bosom, a guard ""Over the vale, ganst him, who hither tends, The serpent."" The narrator, not knowing the serpent's path, turns and presses frozen to Virgil's side.
Sordello says, ""To the valley now (For it is time) let us descend; and hold Converse with those great shadows: haply much Their sight may please ye."" The narrator measures only three steps before he is beneath and notes one spirit who looks desirous to know him. The air is dim, but not so dim that it conceals what was before hidden. They advance toward each other. The narrator recognizes Nino, calling him ""courteous judge!"" and expressing joy that he is not with the bad. They exchange kind salutations. Nino asks how long since the narrator arrived at the mountain's foot. The narrator replies he came that morning through the ""sad seats of woe,"" still in his first life, journeying to gain the other.
Hearing his words, Nino and Sordello draw back, amazed. Nino turns to Virgil, the other to a seated spirit, crying, ""Conrad! up with speed: Come, see what of his grace high God hath will’d."" Nino then turns to the narrator, saying, ""By that rare mark Of honour which thou ow’st to him, who hides So deeply his first cause, it hath no ford, When thou shalt be beyond the vast of waves. Tell my Giovanna, that for me she call There, where reply to innocence is made. Her mother, I believe, loves me no more; Since she has chang’d the white and wimpled folds, Which she is doom’d once more with grief to wish. By her it easily may be perceiv’d, How long in women lasts the flame of love, If sight and touch do not relume it oft. For her so fair a burial will not make The viper which calls Milan to the field, As had been made by shrill Gallura’s bird."" He speaks, and his visage takes the stamp of that right seal.
The narrator's eyes travel to heaven, where the bright stars are slowest. Virgil asks what caught his gaze. The narrator replies, ""The three torches, with which here The pole is all on fire."" Virgil explains the four stars seen that morning are beneath, and these have risen instead.
While Virgil speaks, Sordello draws him to himself and cries, ""Lo there our enemy!"" pointing the way. Along the side, where no barrier rises, a serpent lies, ""such haply as gave Eve the bitter food."" It comes between the grass and flowers, reverting its lifted head, licking its back. The narrator does not see how the celestial falcons move from their seat, but discerns them in motion, hearing the air cut by their green plumes. The serpent flees, and the angels return to their stations.
The spirit who came to Nino does not loosen his sight from the narrator. He begins, ""So may the lamp, which leads thee up on high, Find, in thy destin’d lot, of wax so much, As may suffice thee to the enamel’s height."" He asks for news of Valdimagra and the neighbor part, identifying himself as Conrad Malaspina, not the old one, but from him he sprang. His love for his people is now refined. The narrator replies he has never been in their dominions, but their glory is manifest throughout Europe. He swears their honored nation does not impair ""The value of her coffer and her sword."" Nature and use give her such privilege that while the world is twisted by a bad head, she alone walks aright and scorns evil. Conrad then says, ""Now pass thee on: sev’n times the tired sun Revisits not the couch, which with four feet The forked Aries covers, ere that kind Opinion shall be nail’d into thy brain With stronger nails than other’s speech can drive, If the sure course of judgment be not stay’d."" He says he must away, as the angel comes. He would not hear more.

**CANTO IX**
Tithonus' fair consort (Aurora) looks palely over the eastern cliff, her jewel-lucent brow glittering in the sign of the ""chill animal"" (Scorpion). Two steps of her ascent have passed, and the third is closing its wing. The narrator, heavy with Adam's nature, sinks upon the grass, overcome with sleep, where all five (including Virgil and Sordello) are seated.
At the hour near dawn, when the swallow renews her sad lay, and minds are more wandering from the flesh, the narrator dreams he sees a ""golden-feather’d eagle"" in the sky, hovering for descent. He thinks he is in the place from where young Ganymede was snatched aloft. He thinks the eagle strikes its quarry only here. The eagle wheels, rushes down like lightning, and snatches him upward ""even to the fire."" He dreams both he and the eagle burn, and the intense flames break his sleep.
He shakes himself like Achilles, waking and wondering where he is. His comfort (Virgil) stands at his side, the sun more than two hours aloft. He looks to the sea. Virgil says, ""Fear not: assur’d we are at happy point. Thy strength Shrink not, but rise dilated. Thou art come To Purgatory now. Lo! there the cliff That circling bounds it! Lo! the entrance there, Where it doth seem disparted!"" He explains that before dawn, when the narrator slept, a lady named Lucia came to him in the flowery vale and asked to take the narrator, saying his way would speed easier. Sordello and the other spirits waited while she carried the narrator up to this summit, and Virgil followed her steps. She placed the narrator here, showed Virgil the entrance, then vanished with his sleep.
The narrator's doubts are replaced by certainty, and terror turns to comfort. Virgil, seeing him fearless, moves up the cliff, and the narrator follows. The narrator notes his theme rises, asking the reader not to wonder if he props the structure more artfully.
They draw near the part where a breach like a wall appears. He discerns a portal and three steps beneath it, each of different color, and one who watches silently. As he looks, he marks the watcher seated on the highest step, his visage unbearable. He holds a naked sword, whose rays glance back, making the narrator often direct his sight in vain. The watcher cries, ""Speak from whence ye stand: What would ye? Where is your escort? Take heed your coming upward harm ye not.""
Virgil replies that a ""heavenly dame"" (Lucia) told them to pass this way, as ""here the gate is."" The ""courteous keeper of the gate"" (an angel) wishes their ascent to prosper and bids them come before his steps. They go there.
The lowest stair is smooth, polished white marble, reflecting his form. The next is darker than sable grain, a rough, singed block, cracked lengthwise and across. The third, massy above, seems porphyry, flaming red like life-blood. On this, God's angel sustains either foot, seated on a diamond threshold. Virgil cheerily draws the narrator up the steps, telling him to ask with a humble heart to unbar the bolt.
The narrator casts himself piously at the angel's feet, praying for pity and to open to him, first falling thrice on his bosom. The angel inscribes seven P's (denoting inward stain) on his forehead with the blunt point of his drawn sword, crying, ""Look... When enter’d, that thou wash these scars away."" The angel's robe is the color of ashes or dry earth. From beneath his vestment, he draws two keys, one gold, one silver. With the pale one first, then the burnished, he plies the gate. He says if either key fails to turn, access to this alley is in vain. One key is more precious, but the other needs skill and sagacity to disengage the knot. He holds these keys from Peter, instructed to err rather in opening than keeping fast, if the suppliant implores. He thrusts open the door, exclaiming, ""Enter, but this warning hear: He forth again departs who looks behind.""
The hinges of the sacred ward turn with a strong, harsh grating sound, not so surlily as the Tarpeian roared when bereft of Metellus. The narrator listens to the thunder that issues forth and thinks he hears ""We praise thee, O God,"" blended with sweet melody, like choral voices with an organ.

**CANTO X**
Having passed the threshold of the gate (which the soul's ""ill affection doth disuse, Making the crooked seem the straighter path""), the narrator hears it close. He wonders what plea would have availed if he had turned his eyes back.
They mount the riven rock, winding alternately. Virgil says, ""Here some little art Behooves us... that our steps Observe the varying flexure of the path."" They speed so slowly that the moon once more o'erhangs her watery couch before they thread the strait. When they are free and open where the mount retires, the narrator is spent with toil, and both are uncertain of the way, standing on a plain more lonesome than desert roads.
From the brink to the foot of the steep bank, the space measures thrice a man's stature. The cornice appears equal in extent as far as the eye can see. Before their feet move on the summit, the narrator discovers the bank is white marble, so exquisitely sculpted that not only Polycletus but nature itself would be shamed.
The angel who came to earth with tidings of peace, opening heavenly gates, appears before them, sculpted to life in a sweet act. One would have sworn he said, ""Hail!"" for she (Mary) is imaged there, by whom the key opened to God's love, and her act impresses the words, ""Behold the handmaid of the Lord.""
Virgil tells the narrator not to fix his mind on one place only. The narrator turns and marks another story graven on the rock behind the virgin mother's form. He passes Virgil and draws near. There, the sacred ark is engraved, drawn by a cart and kine, awing mankind. Many people come before it, parted in seven choirs. One sense cries ""Nay,"" another ""Yes, they sing."" Doubt arises between eye and smell from the curled fume of incense. Preceding the vessel, ""Sweet Israel’s harper"" (David) comes leaping with a light dance, girt in humble guise, seeming less and yet more than kingly. Opposite, at a great palace, Michol looks from a lattice, full of scorn and sorrow.
The narrator moves to behold the next tablet, shining whitely behind Michol. There, the ""exalted glory of the Roman prince"" (Trajan) is storied, whose worth moved Gregory. A widow stands at his bridle, attired in tears and mourning. A throng of knights troops around them, and eagles float overhead. The wretch appears to say, ""Grant vengeance, sire! for... My son is murder’d."" Trajan seems to reply, ""Wait now till I return."" She, hasty with grief, asks, ""O sire, if thou Dost not return?"" He replies, ""Where I am, who then is, May right thee."" She asks, ""What to thee is other’s good, If thou neglect thy own?"" At length, he answers, ""Now comfort thee... It beseemeth well My duty be perform’d, ere I move hence: So justice wills; and pity bids me stay.""
Virgil, whose ken surveys nothing new, produced that ""visible speaking, new to us and strange."" The narrator gazes fondly on these patterns of meek humbleness. Virgil whispers, ""Lo... a multitude advance. These to the lofty steps shall guide us on."" The narrator turns his eyes. He warns the reader not to miss his good purpose, hearing how God cancels debts, and not to ponder the form of suffering, but to think on what succeeds.
The narrator asks what is tending hither, as it bears no trace of human semblance. Virgil replies that they are ""courb’d to earth, beneath their heavy teems Of torment stoop,"" so his eye struggled at first. He tells the narrator to look intently and discern their pangs. He addresses ""Christians and proud! O poor and wretched ones!"" who lean their trust on ""unstaid perverseness."" He reminds them they are worms made to form ""winged insect, imp’d with angel plumes That to heaven’s justice unobstructed soars."" He asks why they buoy up their unfledged souls, remaining ""Abortive then and shapeless.""
He describes them like corbels supporting a floor, crumpling their knees to their breast, stirring ruth. Each is more or less contracted by his burden. One, showing most patience, wails, ""I can endure no more.""

**CANTO XI**
The spirits chant ""O thou Almighty Father,"" praying for God's kingdom, daily manna, and forgiveness, and asking God not to let their virtue be easily subdued by the adversary. They pray not for themselves, but for those who remain after them.
The narrator notes that these spirits go beneath a weight like that felt in dreams, all beset with unequal anguish, purging the world's darkness. He asks if their vows are offered on their behalf, what can be vowed and done by those with ""root of goodness."" He says it beseems them to help wash away their stains.
He addresses them, ""Ah! so may mercy-temper’d justice rid Your burdens speedily, that ye have power To stretch your wing... as ye show us on which hand Toward the ladder leads the shortest way. And if there be more passages than one, Instruct us of that easiest to ascend; For this man who comes with me... but slowly mounts.""
The answer comes from an unseen spirit: ""Along the bank to rightward come with us, And ye shall find a pass that mocks not toil Of living man to climb: and were it not That I am hinder’d by the rock, wherewith This arrogant neck is tam’d... him, who yet lives, Whose name thou speak’st not him I fain would view. To mark if e’er I knew him? and to crave His pity for the fardel that I bear."" He identifies himself as Omberto, ""of Latiun, of a Tuscan horn A mighty one."" His ""old blood and forefathers’ gallant deeds"" made him so haughty that he forgot the ""common mother"" and fell. Sienna's sons can tell his fate. Pride injured not only him but his kindred. He groans under this weight to appease God's justice.
The narrator bends his visage down, listening. One spirit (not the speaker), twisted beneath the weight, sees and recognizes him, calling out, holding his eyes fixed with difficulty. The narrator exclaims, ""Art thou not Oderigi, art not thou Agobbio’s glory, glory of that art Which they of Paris call the limmer’s skill?""
Oderigi replies, ""Brother! with tints that gayer smile, Bolognian Franco’s pencil lines the leaves. His all the honour now; mine borrow’d light. In truth I had not been thus courteous to him, The whilst I liv’d, through eagerness of zeal For that pre-eminence my heart was bent on. Here of such pride the forfeiture is paid. Nor were I even here; if, able still To sin, I had not turn’d me unto God."" He laments the vanity of human glory, nipped if a less bright age does not succeed. Cimabue thought to lord over painting, but now Giotto's name eclipses his. One Guido snatched the prize from another, and perhaps one is born who will drive both from their nest. Worldly fame is a blast of wind that shifts its name. He asks if the narrator will live longer in men's mouths if his flesh shrivels, than if he had died before childhood, or before a thousand years pass, which is briefer than an eye's twinkling compared to eternity. He points to the one treading leisurely before him, Provenzano, who once resounded through Tuscany but is now scarce named in Sienna. He was sovereign when Florence's maddening rage was caught, proud as she is now loathsome. Renown is like an herb whose hue comes and goes.
The narrator tells Oderigi his sayings are true, breathing meekness and allaying his ""tumours."" He asks who the spirit Provenzano is. Oderigi replies he is there because he presumptuously grasped sway of all Sienna, and thus goes never-resting since he died. This is the acquittance for his daring.
The narrator asks that if souls delaying repentance linger in the lower space, how Provenzano gained admittance. Oderigi explains that ""When at his glory’s topmost height... Respect of dignity all cast aside, Freely He fix’d him on Sienna’s plain, A suitor to redeem his suff’ring friend, Who languish’d in the prison-house of Charles, Nor for his sake refus’d through every vein To tremble."" He says he will not say more, and his words are dark, but the narrator's neighbors will soon help him comment on the text. ""This is the work, that from these limits freed him.""

**CANTO XII**
The narrator journeys with the laden spirit at an equal pace as oxen in a yoke, as long as Virgil permits. When Virgil bids him quit and proceed, saying ""here... behooves with sail and oars Each man, as best he may, push on his bark,"" the narrator raises his body upright, but his thought remains submissive.
He pursues Virgil's track. Virgil warns him to bend his eyesight down, as it will be good to ruminate the bed beneath his feet.
Like sculptured forms on earth-level tombs, the narrator sees, but with more curious skill, whatever space stretches from the mountain. He beholds Lucifer, once noblest, falling from heaven. On the other side, Briareus, pierced by celestial bolt, lies cumbering earth. He sees the Thymbraean god with Mars and Pallas, armed, gazing on the giant's limbs. He sees Nimrod, standing bewildered at the foot of the stupendous work, looking at the crowd leagued in his proud attempt on Sennaar's plain.
He sees Niobe in a trance of woe, her seven sons slain on either side. He sees Saul, ghastly, expiring on his sword in Gilboa. He sees Arachne, half spider, crawling up her unfinished web. He sees Rehoboam, no longer louring defiance, but fear-smote, whirled in his chariot with none to chase him.
He also sees how Alcmaeon forced his mother to rate her ornament, how Sennacherib's sons fell on him in the temple, how Tomyris mangled Cyrus, and how the Assyrians fled after Holofernes was slain. He marks Troy in ashes and caverns, lamenting its fallen semblance.
He wonders what master could have traced these shades and lines. The dead seem dead, the living alive. His eye sees the truth on what he treads. He tells the proud sons of Eve to swell out with stiff necks, not to veil their looks, lest they descry the evil of their path.
The narrator, so busied, does not note how much of the mount they have circled, or how much more of the sun's course has passed. Virgil admonishes him to raise his head, for it is not a time for slow suspense. He points to an angel hastening toward them, saying, ""Lo Where duly the sixth handmaid doth return From service on the day."" He tells the narrator to wear ""seemly grace of reverent awe"" so the angel may gladly forward them, considering that this day never dawns again.
The narrator, warned often against time's loss, understands. The ""goodly shape"" approaches, snowy white in vesture, with a visage casting streams of tremulous lustre like the morning star. He opens his arms and wings, and speaks: ""Onward: the steps, behold! are near; and now Th’ ascent is without difficulty gain’d.""
He notes that few hasten upon hearing such tidings. He asks, ""O ye race of men Though born to soar, why suffer ye a wind So slight to baffle ye?"" The angel leads them where the rock parts, beats his wings against the narrator's front, then promises he will fare safely. He compares the acclivity to steps carved in the steep above Rubaconte, relieved from the precipitous fall of the other circuit, but with tall cliffs pressing close on each hand.
As they enter, ineffable voices sing, ""Blessed are the poor In spirit."" The narrator notes how unlike this is to the shrieks of hell. They climb the holy stairs. The narrator feels lighter and asks Virgil what heavy thing he has been lightened of. Virgil replies that when sin's broad characters on his temples are all erased, his feet will be so overcome by heartiness of will that they will feel no labor, but delight.
The narrator, like one who finds something on his head by others' becks, stretches forth his right hand and finds only six of the seven P's traced by the angel's sword. Virgil smiles.

**CANTO XIII**
They reach the summit of the scale and stand on the second buttress of the mount. This cornice, like the former, girdles the hill, but its arch bends with a less ample sweep.
No shadow or image is seen; the rampart and path are smooth, reflecting only the rock's sullen hue. Virgil fears delay if they wait to question someone. He fixes his eyes on the sun, making his right the central point, and turns his left aside. He cries, ""O pleasant light, my confidence and hope, Conduct us thou... on this new way... The universal world to thee Owes warmth and lustre. If no other cause Forbid, thy beams should ever be our guide.""
They journey a mile in brief space, impelled by prompt will. Invisible spirits are heard flying toward them, courteously inviting them to ""love’s table."" The first voice cries, ""They have no wine,"" passing behind them. Another comes crying, ""I am Orestes."" The narrator asks Virgil what tongues these are. A third exclaims, ""Love ye those have wrong’d you.""
Virgil explains, ""This circuit... knots the scourge For envy, and the cords are therefore drawn By charity’s correcting hand. The curb Is of a harsher sound... ere thou reach the pass, Where pardon sets them free."" He tells the narrator to look intently through the air, and he will see a multitude seated along the shelving grot.
The narrator opens his eyes wider and sees shadows with garments dark as the rock. As they pass, he hears a crying, ""Blessed Mary! pray for us, Michael and Peter! all ye saintly host!""
The narrator thinks no man on earth is so remorseless as not to yearn with pity at the sight. His eyes teem with sorrow as he stands near enough to see their semblances clearly. Their covering seems vile sackcloth. Each leans on another's shoulder, and all lean against the cliff, like blind and poor people begging near confessionals. Heaven is a niggard of its light to them, for a wire impierces and knits up the orbs of all their eyes, like taming a hawk.
The narrator thinks it wrong to pass and look without being seen himself. He turns to Virgil, who knows his mute appeal and says, ""Speak; and be brief, be subtle in thy words.""
Virgil comes to the part of the cornice with no rim. On the other side are the spirits, bathing their cheeks with penitential tears forced through the ""dread impalement.""
The narrator turns to them and says, ""O shades!... Assur’d that to your eyes unveil’d shall shine The lofty light, sole object of your wish, So may heaven’s grace clear whatsoe’er of foam Floats turbid on the conscience... As ye declare... if any soul Of Latium dwell among ye; and perchance That soul may profit, if I learn so much.""
A voice replies, ""My brother, we are each one citizens Of one true city. Any thou wouldst say, Who lived a stranger in Italia’s land.""
The narrator notes a spirit with an expectant look, chin raised as in one reft of sight. He asks the spirit, if it was the one who answered, to disclose itself by place or name.
It answers, ""I was... of Sienna: here I cleanse away with these the evil life, Soliciting with tears that He, who is, Vouchsafe him to us. Though Sapia nam’d In sapience I excell’d not, gladder far Of others’ hurt, than of the good befell me."" She offers proof of her folly: when her years were waning, her fellow citizens met enemies near Colle. She prayed God to grant what He had willed (their defeat). They were vanquished, and she, watching the hunt, waxed out of bounds in gladness, lifting her shameless brow, crying, ""It is over. Heav’n! I fear thee not."" At her life's verge, she wished for peace with God, but repentance would not have supplied her lack of duty if the hermit Piero had not thought of her in his prayers.
She asks who the narrator is, who questions their state ""with lids unclos’d, And breathest in thy talk?"" The narrator replies his eyes may yet be taken, but not long, for they have not offended grievously with envious glances. But the woe beneath urges his soul with dread, and that nether load already weighs him down.
She asks who brought him aloft if he intends to return. The narrator replies, ""He... who standeth mute beside me. I live: of me ask therefore, chosen spirit, If thou desire I yonder yet should move For thee my mortal feet."" She replies, ""Oh! This is so strange a thing, it is great sign That God doth love thee. Therefore with thy prayer Sometime assist me: and by that I crave, Which most thou covetest, that if thy feet E’er tread on Tuscan soil, thou save my fame Amongst my kindred. Them shalt thou behold With that vain multitude, who set their hope On Telamone’s haven, there to fail Confounded, more shall when the fancied stream They sought of Dian call’d: but they who lead Their navies, more than ruin’d hopes shall mourn.""

**CANTO XIV**
Two spirits, bending toward each other, talk of the narrator: ""Say who is he around our mountain winds, Or ever death has prun’d his wing for flight, That opes his eyes and covers them at will?"" They then both address him, leaning backward, and one asks, ""O soul, who yet Pent in the body, tendest towards the sky! For charity, we pray thee’ comfort us, Recounting whence thou com’st, and who thou art: For thou dost make us at the favour shown thee Marvel, as at a thing that ne’er hath been.""
The narrator begins, ""There stretches through the midst of Tuscany... a brooklet, whose well-head Springs up in Falterona, with his race Not satisfied, when he some hundred miles Hath measur’d. From his banks bring, I this frame. To tell you who I am were words misspent: For yet my name scarce sounds on rumour’s lip.""
The first spirit replies, ""If well I do incorp’rate with my thought The meaning of thy speech... thou dost speak of Arno’s wave."" The other asks why he concealed the river's title, as if it were horrible. The questioned spirit replies he knows not, but ""’tis fitting well the name Should perish of that vale; for from the source Where teems so plenteously the Alpine steep Maim’d of Pelorus... even to the point Whereunto ocean is restor’d... Throughout the space is virtue worried down, As ’twere a snake, by all, for mortal foe, Or through disastrous influence on the place, Or else distortion of misguided wills, That custom goads to evil: whence in those, The dwellers in that miserable vale, Nature is so transform’d, it seems as they Had shar’d of Circe’s feeding.""
He describes the Arno's course: first, it finds ""brute swine, Worthier of acorns,"" then ""Curs, snarlers more in spite than power,"" then ""dogs turning into wolves,"" and finally, ""A race of foxes, so replete with craft."" He says it will be well for the narrator if he remembers what this ""erring Spirit"" reveals. He foresees the narrator's grandson becoming a hunter of those wolves on the fierce stream's shore, cowing them with dread, selling their living flesh, then dooming them like an aged beast. He will reave many of life, himself of worth, leaving such havoc that it will not spread to prime lustihood again in a thousand years.
The listening spirit changes his looks, struck with sadness. The narrator, desiring to know their names, meekly inquires. The spirit who spoke replies, ""Thy wish imports that I vouchsafe to do For thy sake what thou wilt not do for mine. But since God’s will is that so largely shine His grace in thee, I will be liberal too. Guido of Duca know then that I am. Envy so parch’d my blood, that had I seen A fellow man made joyous, thou hadst mark’d A livid paleness overspread my cheek. Such harvest reap I of the seed I sow’d. O man, why place thy heart where there doth need Exclusion of participants in good?""
He identifies the other spirit as Rinieri, ""the boast And honour of the house of Calboli,"" where no heritage of his worth remains. He laments that not only his blood, but many others in that region, have been stripped of all that truth or fancy asks for bliss, and a growth of ""rank and venom’d roots"" has sprung. He asks, ""Where is good Lizio? where Manardi, Traversalo, and Carpigna? O bastard slips of old Romagna’s line!"" He notes that in Bologna, the artisan, and in Faenza, Bernardin sprout, a gentle scion from ignoble stem. He tells the narrator not to wonder if he weeps, recalling loved names: Guido of Prata, Azzo, Tignoso, Traversaro's house, Anastagio's (each disinherited), and ladies and knights who bewitched them into love and courtesy, where now malice reigns. He questions Brettinoro for tarrying, as its family has gone forth, and many hating evil have joined their steps. He praises Bagnacavallo for letting its lineage cease, and criticizes Castracaro and Conio for propagating a race of Counties. He says the Pagani will do well when their ""demon child"" tries from amongst them. He assures Hugolin of Fantolini's line that his name is safe, as none is looked for after him to cloud its lustre. He then tells the narrator to go, as he takes more delight in weeping than in words, such pity has wrung his heart.
They knew the gentle spirits heard their steps, so their silence assured them. As they quit them, a voice like lightning meets them, shouting, ""Whosoever finds Will slay me,"" then flees. Another voice follows with a crash as loud as thunder, ""Mark in me Aglauros turn’d to rock."" The narrator retreats closer to Virgil.
All the air rests in mute stillness. Virgil says, ""There was the galling bit. But your old enemy so baits his hook, He drags you eager to him. Hence nor curb Avails you, nor reclaiming call. Heav’n calls And round about you wheeling courts your gaze With everlasting beauties. Yet your eye Turns with fond doting still upon the earth. Therefore He smites you who discerneth all.""

**CANTO XV**
As much of heaven's sphere appears between the close of the third hour and dawn, so much remains of the sun's journey toward the western goal. Evening is there, and here noon of night. The sun's beams strike full on their forehead. Their path has circled the mountain so they journey directly toward sunset. The narrator feels a weight of ""more exceeding splendour"" press on his front. Amazed, he lifts both hands as a screen, clipping the diminished orb of light. Like a ray striking a mirror, refracted light seems to smite the ground before him, making his sight recoil. He cries, ""What is this, sire belov’d! ’Gainst which I strive to shield the sight in vain? And which towards us moving seems?""
Virgil replies not to marvel if the ""family of heav’n"" dims his sense with dazzling radiance, as it is a messenger inviting ascent. Such sights will soon impart delight as his perception is wrought up to their pitch. The angel, as they reach him, hails them with glad voice: ""Here enter on a ladder far less steep Than ye have yet encount’red."" Ascending, they hear ""Blessed the merciful"" and ""happy thou! That conquer’st"" chanted sweet behind them.
The narrator and Virgil pursue their upward way. The narrator asks Virgil what Romagna's spirit meant by ""bliss exclusive with no partner shar’d."" Virgil replies it is no wonder, as he knows the sorrow of his own worst defect, if he chides others so they may mourn less. He explains that because humans point their wishes at a mark where, by communion, part is lessened, envy causes sighs. No fear of that would touch them if love of a higher sphere exalted their desire, for there, the more they call it ours, the more each's propriety in good increases, and heightened charity wraps the cloister in brighter flame.
The narrator says he lacks more satisfaction than if Virgil had been silent, and doubt gathers. He asks how good distributed makes many possessors richer than if shared by few. Virgil answers, ""Thy mind, reverting still to things of earth, Strikes darkness from true light. The highest good Unlimited, ineffable, doth so speed To love, as beam to lucid body darts, Giving as much of ardour as it finds. The sempiternal effluence streams abroad Spreading, wherever charity extends. So that the more aspirants to that bliss Are multiplied, more good is there to love, And more is lov’d; as mirrors, that reflect, Each unto other, propagated light."" He says if his words do not allay his thirst, Beatrice will rid him of this want, but he must ensure the five scars on his temples are erased.
The narrator says Virgil contents him when he sees the next round gained. He is mute with wonder. Suddenly, he seems rapt away by an ecstatic vision. In a temple, he sees a crowd and a dame at the entrance, expressing a mother's love, saying, ""Child! why hast thou Dealt with us thus? Behold thy sire and I Sorrowing have sought thee;"" then she holds her peace, and the vision flees. Next, a female appears, tears coursing down her visage, saying, ""If thou, Pisistratus, be lord indeed Over this city... Avenge thee of those arms, whose bold embrace Hath clasp’d our daughter."" Her sovereign replies benignly, ""How shall we those requite, Who wish us evil, if we thus condemn The man that loves us?"" After that, he sees a multitude furiously stone a stripling youth, shouting, ""Destroy, destroy!"" The youth, heavy with death, bows to the ground, yet lifts his eyes to heaven, praying forgiveness for his foes with compassionate looks.
As his spirit returns from its airy flight, he observes it roved to no unreal scenes. Virgil, seeing him move like one shaking off sleep, exclaims, ""What ails thee, that thou canst not hold Thy footing firm, but more than half a league Hast travel’d with clos’d eyes and tott’ring gait, Like to a man by wine or sleep o’ercharg’d?""
The narrator tells Virgil what appeared before him. Virgil replies that even with a hundred vizards, no thought of his could elude him. He says what the narrator saw was shown so he might freely open his heart to the ""waters of peace."" He asked not what ailed him to see only with the eye that sees no more when the body is spiritless, but to give fresh vigor to his foot, as ""Such goads The slow and loit’ring need.""
They journey through the evening sky, gazing intent at the bright vespertine ray. Slowly, a fog gathers, dark as night. There is no room for escaping, and the mist bereaves them of sight and pure air.

**CANTO XVI**
The narrator describes the fog as thicker and more palpable than Hell's gloom or any dark night. Entering its shade, his eye cannot endure it with unclosed lids. Virgil draws near, offering his shoulder.
Like a blind man following his leader, the narrator journeys through the ""bitter air and foul,"" listening to Virgil's warning, ""Look that from me thou part not."" He hears voices, each praying for peace and compassion to the ""Lamb of God That taketh sins away."" Their prelude is ""Agnus Dei,"" and through the choir, one voice, one measure runs. The narrator asks if these are spirits. Virgil confirms they ""loose the bonds of wrath.""
One voice asks, ""Now who art thou, that through our smoke dost cleave? And speak’st of us, as thou thyself e’en yet Dividest time by calends?"" Virgil tells the narrator to reply and ask if the passage leads upward.
The narrator addresses the spirit, asking him to come along to hear and wonder. The spirit replies his steps will follow as long as lawful, and since the smoke forbids seeing, hearing will keep them joined. The narrator explains he ascends to higher regions in his mortal body, having come through Hell's agony. He asks the spirit to reveal who he was and if he correctly tends to the pass, directing him.
The spirit replies, ""I was of Lombardy, and Marco call’d: Not inexperienc’d of the world, that worth I still affected, from which all have turn’d The nerveless bow aside. Thy course tends right Unto the summit."" He asks the narrator to pray for him when he comes aloft. The narrator pledges his faith.
He then expresses a doubt that sorely wrings him, now doubled by Marco's opinion and one declared elsewhere. He agrees the world is forlorn of good and swarms with evil, but asks Marco to point out the cause, as some place it in heaven, others on earth.
Marco sighs deeply and begins, ""Brother! the world is blind; And thou in truth com’st from it. Ye, who live, Do so each cause refer to heav’n above, E’en as its motion of necessity Drew with it all that moves. If this were so, Free choice in you were none; nor justice would There should be joy for virtue, woe for ill."" He explains that movements have their primal bent from heaven, but not all. Humans still have light to follow evil or good and ""free power"" of will, which, if firm, conquers. They are subject to mightier force and better nature, but remain free, ""not constrain’d by that, which forms in you The reasoning mind uninfluenc’d of the stars."" If mankind errs, the cause is in themselves.
He explains that the soul comes from God like a babe, artless and ignorant, save that its Maker dwells with gladness. It tastes ""some slight good"" and pursues it, if no guide or rein directs it. Hence, law and a sovereign were needed to mark the ""fortress and main tower Of the true city."" Laws exist, but none observe them, not even the shepherd of the flock, who ""chews the cud but doth not cleave the hoof"" (a metaphor for not distinguishing good from evil). The multitude, seeing their guide strike at the good they covet, feed there and look no further. Thus, the cause is not corrupted nature but ""ill-conducting.""
He says Rome once boasted two suns (Empire and Papacy) that cast light on both the world's and God's way. One has since quenched the other, and the sword is grafted on the crook, so both decline, unawed by fear. He tells the narrator to mark the blade, as each herb is judged by its seed. He says the land between Adice and Po was once courteous and valorous, but now those who for shame have left talking with good men can pass its limits securely. Three aged ones remain: Gherardo, Conrad of Palazzo, and Guido of Castello (called the plain Lombard), who lament the new times. He concludes that the Church of Rome, mixing two governments, has missed its footing and defiled itself and its burden.
The narrator replies that Marco's arguments convince him, and he discerns why Levi's offspring received no heritage. He asks who Gherardo is. Marco replies that either the narrator's words deceive or try him, as he, speaking Tuscan, appears not to have heard of good Gherardo, the only addition being his daughter Gaia's name. He bids them farewell, as dawn glimmers, and he must away before the angel appears. He would not hear more.

**CANTO XVII**
The narrator recalls being taken by a cloud on a mountain top, seeing no better than a mole. Then, as vapors melted, the sun's sphere seemed to wade faintly. He images how he re-beheld the sun, now overhanging its bed.
He describes the ""quick and forgetive power"" that robs them of themselves. He wonders what moves it if the senses stir not, whether light kindled in heaven or gliding down by divine will. Before him came the traces of the impiety of Procne (whose form changed into a bird), and his mind was so wrapped it gave no place to outside thoughts.
Next, a shape like one crucified (Haman) appeared in his fantasy, his visage speaking fell rancor and malice. Around him were Ahasuerus, Esther, and Mordecai. As that ""unsubstantial coinage of the brain"" burst like a bubble, a damsel (Lavinia) weeping loudly arose, crying, ""O queen! O mother! wherefore has intemperate ire Driv’n thee to loath thy being? Not to lose Lavinia, desp’rate thou hast slain thyself. Now hast thou lost me. I am she, whose tears Mourn, ere I fall, a mother’s timeless end.""
Like sleep breaking off when new radiance strikes closed lids, the imagery vanishes as light, outshining earthly beams, strikes his face. As he turns to survey his location, a voice exclaims, ""Here ye mount,"" leaving him no other purpose than to gaze at the speaker. His virtue fails, unequal to the light. Virgil explains this is a ""Spirit from above, Who marshals us our upward way, unsought; And in his own light shrouds him."" He says they should not refuse to lend a ready foot, but hasten to ascend before it darkens.
Virgil leads them to a ladder. Approaching the first stair, the narrator perceives the waving of a wing that fans his face and whispers, ""Blessed they The peacemakers: they know not evil wrath.""
The last beams of the sun are now raised high, followed by hooded night, and many stars shine out. The narrator feels his sinews slacken and asks himself, ""Why partest from me, O my strength?"" They reach the summit and are fixed like a bark at land. Waiting for a short space, the narrator asks Virgil what guilt is purged on this circle.
Virgil replies, ""The love of good, whate’er Wanted of just proportion, here fulfils. Here plies afresh the oar, that loiter’d ill."" He tells the narrator to listen to understand more clearly.
He explains that ""Creator, nor created being, ne’er... was without love, Or natural, or the free spirit’s growth."" Natural love is without error, but the other swerves if bent on an ill object or through excess or defect. While it seeks primal blessings or inferior ones with due measure, no delight from it partakes of ill. But if it warps to evil, or pursues good with too much or too little ardor, the created thing works against its Maker. Hence, love is the ""germin of each virtue... And of each act no less, that merits pain.""
Since love intends the welfare of the loved thing, all are secure from self-hatred. And since no being can exist apart from the first, a bar restrains from hating that.
Granting this, the evil loved must be another's. Such love is gendered three ways: one hopes for preeminence by depressing a neighbor's worth; another fears loss of power, fame, or favor, sickening at the thought of a fellow rising above him; and a third thirsts for vengeance from wrong or insult. This threefold love is mourned here.
He then instructs on the other sort, which follows good with disordered course. All indistinctly apprehend a bliss on which the soul may rest, yearning after it. If they behold or seek it with ""a love remiss and lax,"" this cornice lays its penal torment on them. Other good exists where man finds not happiness; it is not true fruition. Love too lavishly bestowed on this is mourned along three circles above them. He says not to expect account of that tripartite division, as it is fitter for the narrator's own research.

**CANTO XVIII**
Virgil ends his discourse, inquiring if the narrator is content. The narrator, still thirsty to hear him, is mute, but inwardly fears his questioning offends. Virgil, a true father, marks his secret wish and gives him boldness to speak. The narrator says his sight gathers lively virtue from Virgil's beams, so all his words are distinct. He asks Virgil to unfold ""that love, from which as from their source thou bring’st All good deeds and their opposite.""
Virgil tells him to direct his clear ken to what he discloses, and he will plainly behold how much the blind guides of men have erred. The soul, created apt to love, moves whichever way anything pleasing prompts her, once wakened by pleasure. Apprehension forms a counterfeit of true substance, presenting the ideal shape, which attracts the soul. If she inclines toward it, that inclining is love, a new nature knit by pleasure. As fire points up, seeking its birthplace, so the captive soul enters desire, a spiritual motion that rests not before enjoying the loved thing. This shows how truth is hidden from those who aver all love is praiseworthy in itself, though its substance seems good. Yet, if the wax is good, the impression need not be.
The narrator replies that Virgil's words and his docile mind reveal what love is, but new doubts have sprung. If love is offered from without, and the spirit knows no other footing, whether she tends right or wrong is not her desert. Virgil replies he can show what reason discovers, but what lies beyond, he must expect from Beatrice, as it is faith's task, not reason's.
He explains that the spirit, a substantial form joined with matter, has a specific virtue born of that union, felt only when it works, and proved only through effect, like vegetable life by the green leaf. Man knows not whence his intellect deduced its primal notices or his appetites their first affections; such in them is like zeal in bees to gather honey, a volition meriting neither blame nor praise. But supreme over each lower faculty, which are summoned to her bar, they have a virtue whose just voice utters counsel and whose word should keep the threshold of assent. Here is the source of merit, as affections are taken or severed. Those who reasoned to profound depths marked this innate freedom and left their moral teaching to the world. He grants that all love arises from necessity, but the power to dismiss or harbor it is in themselves. He reminds him that Beatrice calls free choice ""The noble virtue.""
The moon, belated near midnight, makes stars wink and fade, her disk like a crag on fire. The weight on the narrator's thought is lightened by Virgil.
The narrator, his questions answered, stands musing in dreary slumber, but not long. Suddenly, a multitude rushes from behind, turning the steep. With fury and random rout, like Ismenus and Asopus echoing for Thebes, they come tumultuous, curving their rapid steps, impelled by eagerness of holy love.
They overtake them swiftly. Two spirits at their head cry weeping, ""Blessed Mary sought with haste The hilly region. Caesar to subdue Ilerda, darted in Marseilles his sting, And flew to Spain."" The others shout, ""Oh tarry not: away; let not time be lost Through slackness of affection. Hearty zeal To serve reanimates celestial grace.""
Virgil addresses them, saying the narrator, who yet lives, desires to ascend, and asks which hand leads nearest to the rifted rock. A shade replies, ""Come after us, and thou shalt find the cleft. We may not linger: such resistless will Speeds our unwearied course. Vouchsafe us then Thy pardon, if our duty seem to thee Discourteous rudeness."" He identifies himself as an abbot of San Zeno in Verona during Barbarossa's reign. He foresees one with one foot in his grave who will weep for that monastery, having misused his power by setting his ill-compacted son in place of its true pastor. The narrator does not know if he spoke more, as he sped far beyond them.
Virgil, who never failed him, cries, ""Hither turn. Lo! two with sharp remorse Chiding their sin!"" In the rear, these two shout, ""First they died, to whom the sea Open’d, or ever Jordan saw his heirs: And they, who with Aeneas to the end Endur’d not suffering, for their portion chose Life without glory."" As they flee from sight, new thoughts rise in the narrator, until his eye closes, and meditation changes to dream.

**CANTO XIX**
It is the hour near dawn when the geomancer sees his ""Greater Fortune"" ascend. Before the narrator in his dream comes a woman's shape with stammering lips, aslant eyes, distorted feet, maimed hands, and pale color. He looks at her, and his look, like sunshine cheering numb limbs, loosens her tongue, raises her decrepit form, and illumines her faded face with love's hue. Recovering speech, she sings, ""I... am the Siren, she, whom mariners On the wide sea are wilder’d when they hear: Such fulness of delight the list’ner feels. I from his course Ulysses by my lay Enchanted drew. Whoe’er frequents me once Parts seldom; so I charm him, and his heart Contented knows no void.""
Before her mouth closes, a dame of holy semblance appears at her side to shame her. With stern voice, she asks Virgil, ""Say, O Virgil, who is this?"" Virgil approaches. The dame seizes the Siren, tearing her robes, opening her before the narrator, and showing her belly, from which a loathsome smell exhales, waking him.
The narrator turns his eyes, and Virgil says, ""At the least Three times my voice hath call’d thee. Rise, begone. Let us the opening find where thou mayst pass."" The narrator rises. Day fills the circuits of the mount, and the early ray smites their shoulder. The narrator follows, stooping his forehead like a man overcharged with thought. He hears, ""Come, enter here,"" in a soft, mild tone.
An angelic shape with swan-like wings marshals them along where the sloping walls retire. Fanning them, he affirms that those who mourn are blessed, for comfort shall be theirs.
Virgil asks, ""What aileth thee, that still thou look’st to earth?"" The narrator replies that a ""New vision"" has raised strange surmises and anxious doubts, allowing no other thought. Virgil asks if he saw the ""old enchantress"" for whom the spirits weep, and how man may free himself. He tells him to spurn the earth and fix his ken on the lure of heaven's King. Like a falcon looking down then stretching for food, the narrator follows the call as far as the dividing rock gives way, reaching the plain.
On the fifth circle, a race of spirits appears, lying prone on the ground, weeping sorely. He hears, ""My soul hath cleaved to the dust,"" with sighs. They ask, ""O ye elect of God, whose penal woes Both hope and justice mitigate, direct Tow’rds the steep rising our uncertain way."" They are told, ""If ye approach secure from this our doom, Prostration—and would urge your course with speed, See that ye still to rightward keep the brink.""
The narrator notes what remains hidden from them, then looks at Virgil, who interprets their suit and beckons assent. The narrator draws near and stands over the shade whose words he marked. He asks the spirit who he was, why they grovel prone, and if he wishes his service in the living world.
The spirit replies he will know why Heaven reverses their back toward its cope, but first to know him. He identifies himself as a successor of Peter, his lineage from the stream between Chiaveri and Siestri. He learned in a month and little more the weight of the robe of sovereignty. He says his conversion was late, but when he became Rome's pastor, he discerned the dream and cozenage of life, saw that the heart rested not there, and no prouder height lured him. So, enamored no more of that life, love of purer being kindled in his bosom. Until then, he was a soul in misery, alienated from God and covetous of earthly things. Now, he is punished for his doting. Such cleansing from avarice is what converted spirits need. This mount inflicts no direr penalty. As their eyes were fastened below and never lifted, justice has leveled them on earth. As avarice quenched their love of good, justice holds them prisoned, hand and foot chained, as long as heaven's Lord pleases.
The narrator stoops his knees to speak, but the spirit perceives his reverence and asks, ""What cause... Hath bow’d thee thus!"" The narrator replies, ""Compunction... And inward awe of your high dignity.""
The spirit exclaims, ""Up... upon thy feet Arise: err not: thy fellow servant I... of one Sovran Power."" He says if the narrator has marked the gospel truth, ""nor shall be given ill marriage,"" he may discern the reasons of his speech. He tells him to go and linger no more, as his tarrying lets his tears, with which he hastens what the narrator spoke of. He has a kinswoman on earth, Alagia, worthy in herself if ill example does not corrupt her, and she is all that remains of him there.

**CANTO XX**
The narrator moves onward, Virgil leading, coasting along the rock wherever vacant, like a man on narrow battlements. Those on the other part, who wring out their malady drop by drop, press the verge too closely. The narrator curses the ""Inveterate wolf!"" (avarice) whose maw is bottomless. He asks the spheres of heaven when the one for whom fate reserves to chase her hence will appear.
They pass with wary, slow steps. The narrator is attentive to the shades, hearing them lament and wail. Amidst the wailing, one cries out, ""O blessed Virgin!"" like a dame in childbed, adding, ""How poor Thou wast... witness that low roof Where thou didst lay thy sacred burden down. O good Fabricius! thou didst virtue choose With poverty, before great wealth with vice.""
The narrator is pleased by the words and wishes to know the spirit. It speaks of Nicholas's gift to maidens to save their prime unblemished. The narrator asks who he is and why he renews such praise with a single voice, hoping for reward if he returns to life.
The spirit replies he will tell, not for hell, but because ""Grace so exceeding shines"" in the narrator. He identifies himself as the ""root Of that ill plant, whose shade such poison sheds O’er all the Christian land, that seldom thence Good fruit is gather’d."" He calls for vengeance, saying it should come if Ghent, Douay, Lille, and Bruges had power, and he implores it from Heaven's Judge. He reveals he was Hugh Capet, from whom the Philips and Louis of France descend, born of one who plied the slaughterer's trade. When the ancient kings vanished, he found the reins of empire and powers of new acquirement, so the crown was soon girt on his son's temples, from whom the anointed race begins.
He says until the ""great dower of Provence"" removed the stains from their lowly blood, their sway was narrow but wrought no evil. There, with force and lies, rapine began. Then, for amends, Poitou, Navarre, and Gascony were seized. Charles came to Italy and slew young Conradine, ""an innocent victim,"" still for amends. He foresees another Charles from France, unarmed save with the lance the ""arch-traitor"" tilted with, who will thrust it into Florence's bowels, gaining no territory but sin and shame. He sees another, a prisoner, exposing his daughter to the market like corsairs sell slaves. He laments avarice, which subdues their blood so they care not for their own flesh. He sees the ""flower-de-luce"" (French royal emblem) enter Alagna to hide past and future ill, making Christ a captive in his Vicar, mocking him, applying vinegar and gall to his holy lip, and dooming him to bleed among living robbers. He sees the ""new Pilate"" pushing on into the temple.
He asks the ""sovran Master"" when he will rejoice to see vengeance. He explains that during daylight, what the narrator heard of Mary is the general theme of their prayers. But when it darkens, they utter a different strain, recording Pygmalion (made traitor, robber, parricide by gold), Midas (whose greedy wish brought derision), and Achan (who stole prey, pursued by Joshua's ire). They blame Sapphira and her husband and praise the forefeet that spurned Heliodorus. The mountain rings with the infamy of Thracia's king (Polymnestor), who slew his Phrygian charge. Last, a shout ascends: ""Declare, O Crassus! for thou know’st, The flavour of thy gold."" Each voice, high or low, is led through many a pitch. He says he rehearsed that blessedness not singly, but none near him raised his accent.
They part from him and try to surmount the way. The narrator feels the mountain tremble, seizing him with an icy chill, like one conveyed to death. Delos did not shake so much. A vehement shout arises from every side. Virgil draws near, crying, ""Doubt not, while I conduct thee."" All shout, ""Glory! Glory in the highest be to God."" They stand suspended like the shepherds who first heard that song in Bethlehem. When the trembling and song cease, they resume their hallowed path, eyeing the prostrate shadows who renew their mourning. The narrator's ignorance struggles with desire for knowledge, but he dares not question.

**CANTO XXI**
The narrator's ""natural thirst,"" unquenched save from the well of the Samaritan woman, impels him to haste along the path after Virgil. Pity moves him for the vengeful deed, though just.
Like Luke's account of Christ appearing to two on their way, a shade appears behind them, contemplating the crowd beneath its feet. Unaware, they hear it say, ""God give you peace, my brethren!"" They turn, and Virgil returns a fitting salute, crying, ""Peace in the blessed council be thy lot Awarded by that righteous court, which me To everlasting banishment exiles!""
The shade exclaims, without stopping, ""How! If that ye be spirits, whom God Vouchsafes not room above, who up the height Has been thus far your guide?"" Virgil replies that if the narrator's tokens (the P's) are observed, it is plain he must share in the kingdom of the just. But since Clotho has not yet drawn the yarn of his mortal life, his soul, sister to theirs, cannot mount by itself. Virgil was taken from Hell's gulf to lead him as far as his lore avails. He asks the shade to instruct them why the mount shook and trembled and why all shouted.
The narrator's thirst for knowledge abates from expectance. The shade replies that this mount witnesses nothing irregular or unsanctioned. No influence other than what heaven receives can reach them. No tempest, shower, hail, snow, frost, or dew falls higher than the ""threefold steps"" (of the gate). No thick clouds, lightning, or rainbow are seen. Vapor never mounts above the highest of Peter's stairs. Lower, the soil may tremble with various motion, but here, through wind pent in earth's hollow, it never trembles except ""when any spirit feels itself So purified, that it may rise, or move For rising, and such loud acclaim ensues."" Purification is proved by the will alone, which, free to change society, seizes the soul rejoicing in her will. Desire for bliss is present from the first, but strong propension (to sin) hinders it, opposed by heaven's ordinance. Now, propension is eager to fulfill the allotted torment.
The shade says he has lain in this punishment for ""Five hundred years and more,"" but now feels a ""Free wish for happier clime."" Therefore, the narrator felt the mountain tremble and heard the spirits utter praise to their Liege Lord. The narrator is full of content.
Virgil says he now sees the net that takes them and how the toils are loosed, why the mountain rocks and why they rejoice. He asks the shade who he was on earth and why he was prostrate for so many ages.
The shade replies that in the time when Titus avenged the wounds from which Judas's blood issued, he was renowned by the ""Most lasting and most honour’d name,"" though ""not yet with faith endued."" His ""vocal Spirit"" drew him from Tolosa to Rome, where he merited a myrtle garland. His name is Statius. He sang of Thebes and Achilles but fell with the second burden (the Aeneid). The sparks of his flame (inspiration) derived from the ""bright fountain of celestial fire"" (Virgil's Aeneid), which was his nurse and authority. He says to have lived coeval with Virgil, he would bide the revolution of another sun beyond his stated years in banishment.
Virgil turns to the narrator, enjoining silence by his countenance. But the will does not bear supreme control, and laughter and tears follow passion closely. The narrator smiles, ""as one who winks."" Statius breaks off, peers into his eyes, and asks why a smile beamed across his visage.
The narrator is straitened, one conjuring him to speak, the other to silence. He sighs. Virgil tells him to speak and tell Statius what he asks. The narrator says Statius marvels at his smiling, but there is room for more wonder. He reveals that Virgil, who guides his ken, is the Mantuan by whom Statius sang of men and gods. He tells Statius to believe this is the true cause of his smile.
Satius bends down to embrace Virgil's feet, but Virgil forbids him, ""Brother! do it not: Thou art a shadow, and behold’st a shade."" Statius rises and replies, ""Now hast thou prov’d The force and ardour of the love I bear thee, When I forget we are but things of air, And as a substance treat an empty shade.""

**CANTO XXII**
They leave the angel, who has erased one P from the narrator's forehead, and ascend to the sixth circle. Those whose wishes tend to justice shout, ""Blessed!"" and end with, ""I thirst."" The narrator, more nimble, journeys without toil, following the swift-footed shades.
Virgil begins, ""Let its pure flame From virtue flow, and love can never fail To warm another’s bosom’ so the light Shine manifestly forth."" He explains that since the spirit of Aquinum's bard (Thomas Aquinas) came among them in the deep and told of Statius's affection, his goodwill for Statius has been strong. He says the stairs will seem short. He asks Statius, as a friend, how covetous desire found place in his bosom, amidst such wisdom.
Statius, somewhat moved to laughter, replies that each syllable of Virgil's is a dear pledge of love. Things often appear to minister false matters to doubts when true causes are removed. Virgil's question assures him that he believes Statius was covetous, perhaps because he found him in that circle. Statius reveals he was too far from avarice, and for that excess, thousands of moons have passed. If he had not noted Virgil's exclamation against the ""cursed thirst Of gold,"" he would have met the ""fierce encounter of the voluble rock."" He then became aware that hands may hasten to lavishment with too ample wing and turned from this evil in penitence. Many will rise from their grave with shorn locks who did not repent this offense through ignorance. He explains that the fault directly opposite to any sin wastes its rankness on a common heap here. Therefore, his lot was to be with those who wail their avarice, to cleanse himself through the reverse of their transgression.
Virgil then asks Statius, ""While thou didst sing that cruel warfare wag’d By the twin sorrow of Jocasta’s womb, From thy discourse with Clio there, it seems As faith had not been shine: without the which Good deeds suffice not. And if so, what sun Rose on thee, or what candle pierc’d the dark That thou didst after see to hoist the sail, And follow, where the fisherman had led?""
Statius replies, ""By thee conducted first, I enter’d the Parnassian grots, and quaff’d Of the clear spring; illumin’d first by thee Open’d mine eyes to God."" He says Virgil was like one who, journeying through darkness, hears a light behind that profits not himself but makes his followers wise, when he exclaimed, ""Lo! A renovated world! Justice return’d! Times of primeval innocence restor’d! And a new race descended from above!"" Statius owes both poet and Christian to Virgil. He will stretch his hand to inform the lines with livelier coloring. Soon, the true belief teemed over the world by messengers from heaven, and Virgil's word accorded with the new instructors. Induced by this, Statius resorted to them, and their sanctity won him over. During Domitian's rage, he mixed his tears with theirs and succored them, and their righteous customs made him scorn all other sects. Before he led the Greeks in tuneful fiction to Thebes, he was baptized, but secretly, through fear, remained a Christian and conformed to Pagan rites. For that lukewarmness, he was fain to pace round the fourth circle for five centuries and more.
He asks Virgil, who has raised the covering hiding this blessing from him, if he knows where Terence, Caecilius, Plautus, and Varro bide, and if they are condemned. Virgil replies that these, with Persius, himself, and many others, are with ""that Greek, Of mortals, the most cherish’d by the Nine"" (Homer) in the first ward of darkness. There, they often converse of the mount where their nurses live. They have the bard of Pella (Alexander), the Teian (Anacreon), Agatho, Simonides, and other Greeks. Of Statius's train, Antigone, Deiphile, Argia, Ismene, and she who showed Langia's wave (Hypsipyle), Deidamia with her sisters, and blind Tiresias's daughter, and the sea-born bride of Peleus (Thetis) are there.
Both poets are silent. Four handmaids of the day have finished their office, and the fifth is at the chariot-beam. Virgil says, ""Methinks, it well behooves us to the brink Bend the right shoulder’ circuiting the mount, As we have ever us’d."" Custom guides them.
They go before the narrator, who follows, listening to their speech conveying ""Mysterious lessons of sweet poesy."" They cease, for midway a tree is found with goodly fruitage, pleasant to smell, spreading less amply downward, so none may climb aloft. A liquid crystal falls from the steep rock by the side that closes their path. The bards draw near the plant, and a voice from the leaves says, ""Ye shall be chary of me;"" adding, ""Mary took more thought For joy and honour of the nuptial feast, Than for herself who answers now for you. The women of old Rome were satisfied With water for their beverage. Daniel fed On pulse, and wisdom gain’d. The primal age Was beautiful as gold; and hunger then Made acorns tasteful, thirst each rivulet Run nectar. Honey and locusts were the food, Whereon the Baptist in the wilderness Fed, and that eminence of glory reach’d And greatness, which the’ Evangelist records.""

**CANTO XXIII**
The narrator's eyes are fixed on the green leaf, like one idly chasing the diminutive, when Virgil warns him, ""Son! our time Asks thriftier using. Linger not: away.""
The narrator turns his face and steps toward the sages, cheered by their converse, feeling no toil. He hears a sound of weeping and a song, ""My lips, O Lord!"" mingled to create pleasure and pain. He asks Virgil what he hears. Virgil replies, ""Spirits... who as they go, perchance, Their debt of duty pay.""
Like thoughtful pilgrims overtaking strangers, a crowd of silent, devout spirits, moving with speedier motion, eyes them as they pass. Their eyes are dark and hollow, their visages pale and lean, bones staring through the skin. The narrator thinks Erisicthon was not so dry and meager.
He muses, ""Lo! the race, who lost Jerusalem, when Mary with dire beak Prey’d on her child."" Their eye sockets seem like rings without gems. He wonders who would deem that the scent of water and an apple could cause such pining want. A spirit turns his deep-sunken eyes on the narrator and cries, ""What grace is this vouchsaf’d me?"" The narrator does not recognize him by his looks, but his voice reveals Forese. Forese implores, ""Ah! respect This wan and leprous wither’d skin... this macerated flesh. Speak to me truly of thyself. And who Are those twain spirits, that escort thee there? Be it not said thou Scorn’st to talk with me.""
The narrator replies that Forese's face, which he once bewailed dead, disposes him to weep now. He asks by Heaven what blasts them thus, saying he is unapt to speak while wondering.
Forese replies, ""The water and tee plant we pass’d, Virtue possesses, by th’ eternal will Infus’d, the which so pines me. Every spirit, Whose song bewails his gluttony indulg’d Too grossly, here in hunger and in thirst Is purified. The odour, which the fruit, And spray, that showers upon the verdure, breathe, Inflames us with desire to feed and drink. Nor once alone encompassing our route We come to add fresh fuel to the pain: Pain, said I? solace rather: for that will To the tree leads us, by which Christ was led To call Elias, joyful when he paid Our ransom from his vein.""
The narrator asks Forese how he came so soon, as not five years have passed since he changed worlds, and he thought to find him lower, where time is recompense for time. Forese replies that Nella's tears and prayers brought him early from the coast where expectance lingers, freeing him from other circles. His widow is dearer in God's sight as she is more eminent for virtuous deeds. He says Sardinia has more chaste dames than Florence. He foresees a time when Florence's unblushing dames will be warned from the pulpit not to bare unkerchiefed bosoms. He asks what savage women needed such discipline to cover their limbs. He says if they saw Heaven's swift wing approaching, their mouths would open for howling, and they shall taste sorrow before the cheek of one now rocked asleep is clothed with down. He asks the narrator to hide himself no more, as all gaze where he veils the sun.
The narrator replies that remembrance of their past together might grieve him. He says his forsaking that life was due to Virgil, who preceded him a few evenings past. He points to the sun, saying Virgil brought him through the ""profoundest night Of he true dead... with this flesh As true, that follows."" Virgil's comfort drew him to climb this mountain-steep, which rectifies what the world made crooked. He has Virgil's word that he will bear him company until he comes where Beatrice dwells, but must leave him there. He points to Virgil. The other shade, for whom their realm shook, is Statius.

**CANTO XXIV**
Their journey and talk are not slackened. The shadowy forms, appearing dead and dead again, show rare wonder at the narrator's life. The narrator continues, saying he journeys perhaps more tardily for others' sake. He asks Forese where Piccarda is and if he sees any notable spirits among the multitude.
Forese replies, ""My sister (she for whom, ’Twixt beautiful and good I cannot say Which name was fitter ) wears e’en now her crown, And triumphs in Olympus."" He adds that because spare diet has worn out their semblance, it is lawful to name each one. He points out Buonaggiuna of Lucca. He points to the face beyond him, pierced to a leaner fineness, who had keeping of the church, from Tours, purging Bolsena's eels and muscadel by abstinence.
He shows many others, all seeming content when named. The narrator sees Ubaldino grind his teeth on emptiness, and Boniface wave the crozier. He sees the Marquis, who had time to swill at Forli. The narrator singles out the one from Lucca, who seemed to note him most. He hears him whisper of Gentucca, the sound indistinct where justice fixes her sting.
The narrator asks the spirit to speak, as mutual wish prompts conversation. The spirit answers that a woman is born whose brow no wimple shades yet, who will make his city please the narrator. He tells the narrator to go with this forewarning, and if his whisper implied anything false, the event will tell. He asks if the narrator is the inventor of the ""new lay"" beginning with ""Ladies, ye that con the lore of love.""
The narrator replies he is ""the scribe of love; that, when he breathes, Take up my pen, and, as he dictates, write.""
The spirit replies that the hindrance that held the notary, Guittone, and himself short of that ""new and sweeter style"" is now disclosed. He sees how they stretch their plumes as the inditer guides them, which theirs did not. He who seeks a grace beyond sees not the distance between styles. He then holds his peace, contented.
Like birds wintering near the Nile, the tribe of spirits turn their visage, deaf, nimble alike through leanness and desire. Like a man tired from a trotting steed, Forese lets the holy crew proceed, lingering at the narrator's side, asking, ""When shall I again behold thee?""
The narrator replies he knows not how long his life will last, but his wishes will arrive before him, as his place of living is daily scooped of good and threatened by ruin.
Forese cries, ""Go now: lo! he, whose guilt is most, Passes before my vision, dragg’d at heels Of an infuriate beast."" He describes it speeding toward the vale of no redemption, each step increasing swiftness, until it strikes a blow that leaves him a ""corse most vilely shatter’d."" He looks up to heaven, saying, ""No long space Those wheels have yet to roll... ere thou shalt plainly see That which my words may not more plainly tell. I quit thee: time is precious here: I lose Too much, thus measuring my pace with shine.""
Like a knight pricking forth from chivalry, he parts with lengthened strides, leaving the narrator with Virgil and Statius.
When Forese is out of sight, branches of another fruit, thick hung and blooming fresh, appear. As they turn thither, a multitude beneath it raises their hands, shouting to the boughs, like greedy children begging. He at arm's length holds the object of their wish above them.
At length, undeceived, they go their way. They approach the tree, which vows and tears sue to in vain. Sounds from the thickets say, ""Pass on, And come not near. Stands higher up the wood, Whereof Eve tasted, and from it was ta’en This plant."" The narrator passes forth with both bards.
Next, they hear, ""Remember... those noblest creatures of the clouds, How they their twofold bosoms overgorg’d Oppos’d in fight to Theseus: call to mind The Hebrews, how effeminate they stoop’d To ease their thirst; whence Gideon’s ranks were thinn’d.""
Coasting near one border, they still hear the sins of gluttony, with woe requited. Then, along the lonely path, they travel a thousand paces, contemplative and mute.
Suddenly, a voice exclaims, ""Why pensive journey thus ye three alone?"" The narrator shakes and raises his head. He sees a shape as bright and glowing red as glass or metal in a furnace. The shape cries, ""If ye desire to mount... here must ye turn. This way he goes, Who goes in quest of peace."" His countenance dazzles the narrator, who faces backward to his guides, walking as sound directs.
A gentle wind, like May's air, breathes on his front, and he perceives the moving of a wing shedding ambrosial smell. Then a voice says, ""Blessed are they, whom grace Doth so illume, that appetite in them Exhaleth no inordinate desire, Still hung’ring as the rule of temperance wills.""

**CANTO XXV**
It is an hour when one climbing needs to walk uncrippled, as the sun has left Taurus and the night the Scorpion. They enter their way, one before the other, as only singly can one climb the steep, narrow scale.
Like a young stork lifting its wing to fly but not venturing to quit the nest, the narrator's desire to question his guide arises and falls. Virgil, not restrained by their haste, says, ""Fear not to speed the shaft, that on thy lip Stands trembling for its flight."" Encouraged, the narrator asks, ""How there can leanness come, Where is no want of nourishment to feed?""
Virgil replies that if he had remembered Meleager wasting with the brand, or how his reflected form vibrates in a mirror, this would not trouble him. But to fully repose his will in certainty, he calls on Statius to heal his wound.
Statius replies, ""If in thy presence I unfold to him The secrets of heaven’s vengeance, let me plead Thine own injunction, to exculpate me."" He then begins, ""Attend my words, O son, and in thy mind Receive them: so shall they be light to clear The doubt thou offer’st. Blood, concocted well, Which by the thirsty veins is ne’er imbib’d, And rests as food superfluous... in the heart Derives effectual virtue, that informs The several human limbs, as being that, Which passes through the veins itself to make them.""
He explains that more concocted, it descends where shame forbids mention, and from there distills into a natural vessel on another's blood. Then each unites, one to endure, the other to act, through the recipient mold. It begins to coagulate, then vivifies what its substance caused to bear. With animation, the active virtue (differing from a plant only in being on the way or at its limit) continues to operate, moving and feeling like a sea sponge, assuming organic powers. This is the period when the virtue from the generating heart is pliable and expansive, for each limb is planned in the heart by nature. He explains how an animal becomes a babe, saying that the narrator erred in making the soul disjoined from passive intellect because he saw no organ for the latter.
He tells the narrator to open his bosom to the truth: as soon as articulation is complete in the embryo's brain, the ""primal Mover"" turns with a smile of joy on such work and imbreathes a new spirit replete with virtue, which draws what it finds active to its own substance, forming an individual soul that lives, feels, and reflects on itself. To make the narrator marvel less, he points to the sun's heat changing wine, mixed with moisture filtered through the vine.
When Lachesis has spun the thread, the soul takes with her both human and divine, memory, intelligence, and will, keener than before, other powers inactive. Self-moving, it falls to one strand where the departed roam, learning its destined path. As the place receives her, the plastic virtue beams, distinct as in living limbs. As air, saturated with showers, refracts a beam and decks itself with hues, so the ambient air wears the form imprinted by the soul. Like a flame following fire, the new form follows the spirit. Hence, it has semblance and is called shadow, endowed with every sense, even sight. Hence, speech, laughter, tears, and sighs are theirs, which the narrator may have witnessed on the mount. The obedient shadow presents whatever passion moves within them. This is the cause of what the narrator marvels at.
They reach the last flexure of their way and turn right, where ""other care Awaits us."" The rocky precipice hurls forth flames, and a blast drives them back. They must pass one by one along the side bordering the void. The narrator fears fire on one hand and falling headlong on the other. Virgil warns, ""Strict rein must in this place direct the eyes. A little swerving and the way is lost.""
From the burning mass, the narrator hears ""O God of mercy!"" sung and feels desire to turn. He sees spirits proceeding along the flame and wishes to share his view between their footsteps and his own. At the hymn's close, they shout, ""I do not know a man;"" then in low voice again take up the strain, which ends with, ""To the wood... Ran Dian, and drave forth Callisto, stung With Cytherea’s poison."" Then they return to their song, extolling many pairs who lived chastely and the bands of wedded love. They do not cease this task as long as the fire clasps them, as such skill is needed to medicine the last-healing wound.

**CANTO XXVI**
As they walk singly along the rim, Virgil often warns the narrator to look well. The sun has changed the western clime from azure to white. The narrator's passing shadow makes the umbered flame burn ruddier. Many spirits marvel at this strange sight.
This gives occasion to speak of the narrator: ""He seems... no insubstantial frame."" To gain certainty, they stretch toward him, careful not to overpass the burning pale. One spirit asks, ""O thou, who followest The others, haply not more slow than they, But mov’d by rev’rence, answer me, who burn In thirst and fire: nor I alone, but these All for thine answer do more thirst, than doth Indian or Aethiop for the cooling stream. Tell us, how is it that thou mak’st thyself A wall against the sun, as thou not yet Into th’ inextricable toils of death Hadst enter’d?""
The narrator would have declared himself, but his attention turns to a new appearance. Meeting these, a crowd comes midway the burning path. The narrator sees the shadows press forward, each snatching a hasty kiss, then moving away. He compares this to ants peering at each other.
After this friendly greeting, before the first step onward, loud clamor rises from either tribe. Those newly come shout ""Sodom and Gomorrah!"" These shout, ""The cow Pasiphae enter’d, that the beast she woo’d Might rush unto her luxury."" Like cranes flying to Riphaean mountains or Lybic sands, one crowd hastens off, the other advances, resuming their song and shout.
The same spirit who asked before draws near, eager to listen. The narrator, having noted their will twice, speaks: ""O spirits secure, Whene’er the time may be, of peaceful end! My limbs, nor crude, nor in mature old age, Have I left yonder: here they bear me, fed With blood, and sinew-strung. That I no more May live in blindness, hence I tend aloft. There is a dame on high, who wind for us This grace, by which my mortal through your realm I bear. But may your utmost wish soon meet Such full fruition, that the orb of heaven, Fullest of love, and of most ample space, Receive you, as ye tell (upon my page Henceforth to stand recorded) who ye are, And what this multitude, that at your backs Have past behind us.""
Each spirit appears confounded and struck dumb, like a rustic entering a city. But when rid of that amaze, the one who questioned before resumes: ""O blessed, who, for death preparing, tak’st Experience of our limits, in thy bark! Their crime, who not with us proceed, was that, For which, as he did triumph, Caesar heard The snout of ‘queen,’ to taunt him. Hence their cry Of ‘Sodom,’ as they parted, to rebuke Themselves, and aid the burning by their shame. Our sinning was Hermaphrodite: but we, Because the law of human kind we broke, Following like beasts our vile concupiscence, Hence parting from them, to our own disgrace Record the name of her, by whom the beast In bestial tire was acted."" He says the narrator now knows their deeds and sin. He says time permits not to tell their names, but the narrator can learn what he wishes of him: ""Guinicelli I, Who having truly sorrow’d ere my last, Already cleanse me.""
The narrator feels pious joy, like two sons gazing on their mother rescued from Lycurgus, when he hears the name of him who was a father to him and his betters in sweet rhymes of love. He listens thoughtfully, gazing on him, approaching not nearer only for the fire. When his eyes are fed, he devotes himself to Guinicelli's service. Guinicelli replies that what he hears is deeply engraved and Lethe will not wash it off. He asks what cause impels the love his looks and speech betray.
The narrator answers, ""Those dulcet lays... which, as long As of our tongue the beauty does not fade, Shall make us love the very ink that trac’d them.""
Guinicelli cries, ""Brother!"" and points to a shade before him, saying there is one whose mother tongue owes him a fairer ornament. He stands unrivaled in love ditties and prose tales, letting fools talk who think the songster of Limoges (Giraut de Bornelh) overtops him. He says rumor and popular voice are looked to more than truth. He notes many of the elder time cried up Guittone until truth vanquished by strength of numbers. He asks the narrator, if he has gained free entrance to the cloister where Christ is Abbot, to say one Paternoster for him. Guinicelli then vanishes through the fire like a fish.
The narrator draws a little onward to the spirit Guinicelli showed him and asks his name. The spirit frankly begins, ""Thy courtesy So wins on me, I have nor power nor will To hide me. I am Arnault; and with songs, Sorely lamenting for my folly past, Thorough this ford of fire I wade, and see The day, I hope for, smiling in my view. I pray ye by the worth that guides ye up Unto the summit of the scale, in time Remember ye my suff’rings."" With such words, he disappears in the refining flame.

**CANTO XXVII**
The sun is stationed as when its early radiance quivers on the heights where Christ's blood streamed, while Libra hangs above Hesperian Ebro, and new fires flash on Ganges' tide.
Day is sinking when the angel of God appears before them, joy in his mien. He stands forth from the flame on the brink and sings, ""Blessed are the pure In heart,"" in a voice of lively clearness. As they come near, he cries, ""Go ye not further, holy spirits! Ere the fire pierce you: enter in; and list Attentive to the song ye hear from thence.""
The narrator, hearing this, is like one laid in the grave. He clasps his hands, stretches them upward, and looks at the fire, his fancy conjuring forms consumed in flames.
The escorting spirits turn with gentle looks. Virgil says, ""My son, Here torment thou mayst feel, but canst not death. Remember thee, remember thee, if I Safe e’en on Geryon brought thee: now I come More near to God, wilt thou not trust me now? Of this be sure: though in its womb that flame A thousand years contain’d thee, from thy head No hair should perish. If thou doubt my truth, Approach, and with thy hands thy vesture’s hem Stretch forth, and for thyself confirm belief. Lay now all fear, O lay all fear aside. Turn hither, and come onward undismay’d."" The narrator, though conscience urged, does not advance.
When Virgil sees him fixed and obstinate, he cries, ""Mark now, my son, From Beatrice thou art by this wall Divided."" Like Pyramus's eye opening at Thisbe's name, the narrator turns to Virgil, relenting, when he hears the name that springs forever in his breast.
Virgil shakes his forehead and says, ""How long Linger we now?"" then smiles like one smiling at a child eyeing fruit. He walks into the fire before the narrator, and asks Statius, who had parted them, to come behind.
The narrator would have cast himself into molten glass to cool, so intense is the conflagrant mass. Virgil, to comfort him, talks of Beatrice, saying, ""Her eyes... E’en now I seem to view."" From the other side, a voice singing guides them, and following it, they issue forth where the path leads upward. They hear, ""Come... Come, blessed of my Father."" These sounds hail them from a light so radiant the narrator cannot endure the view. The voice adds, ""The sun... hastes: and evening comes. Delay not: ere the western sky is hung With blackness, strive ye for the pass.""
Their way rises upright within the rock, facing a part of heaven that shrouds the sinking sun's beams from his steps. Not many stairs are passed when they perceive the sun behind them by the fading shadow. Before one face of darkness involves the horizon, each has made a stair his pallet, not from failing will but power, forbidden further travel by the mountain's nature. Like goats ruminating under shade, or a swain lodging by his flock, all three abide, the narrator as a goat, Virgil and Statius as shepherds, close-pent by shelving rock.
A little glimpse of sky is seen above, showing stars in magnitude and lustre with more than wonted glory. As he lies gazing, sleep overcomes him, bringing tidings of future hap. About the hour when Venus lightens the mountain from the east, the narrator dreams a young, beautiful lady is passing over a lea, bending to cull flowers, singing, ""Know ye, whoever of my name would ask, That I am Leah: for my brow to weave A garland, these fair hands unwearied ply. To please me at the crystal mirror, here I deck me. But my sister Rachel, she Before her glass abides the livelong day, Her radiant eyes beholding, charm’d no less, Than I with this delightful task. Her joy In contemplation, as in labour mine.""
As glimmering dawn appears, darkness flees, and with it his slumber. He rises and sees Virgil already risen. Virgil says, ""That delicious fruit, Which through so many a branch the zealous care Of mortals roams in quest of, shall this day Appease thy hunger."" The narrator finds this greeting pleasant. Desire to mount grows within him, and at each step, he feels wings increasing for flight.
When they reach the topmost round of the ladder, Virgil fixes his eyes on the narrator and says, ""Both fires, my son, The temporal and eternal, thou hast seen, And art arriv’d, where of itself my ken No further reaches. I with skill and art Thus far have drawn thee. Now thy pleasure take For guide. Thou hast o’ercome the steeper way, O’ercome the straighter. Lo! the sun, that darts His beam upon thy forehead! lo! the herb, The arboreta and flowers, which of itself This land pours forth profuse! Till those bright eyes With gladness come, which, weeping, made me haste To succour thee, thou mayst or seat thee down, Or wander where thou wilt. Expect no more Sanction of warning voice or sign from me, Free of thy own arbitrement to choose, Discreet, judicious. To distrust thy sense Were henceforth error. I invest thee then With crown and mitre, sovereign o’er thyself.""

**CANTO XXVIII**
Through the ""celestial forest,"" whose thick shade tempers the new-springing day, the narrator eagerly leaves the bank, pursuing his way leisurely along the champaign, which breathes delicious odor. A pleasant, unvarying air smites his temples, making the sprays lean trembling toward where the mountain casts its shade. Yet, the feathered quiristers still apply their art, welcoming the hours of prime and warbling amid the leaves. His slow steps have carried him so far into the wood that he cannot see where he entered when his path is bounded by a rill. The water flows to the left, rippling the grass, and is transpicuous and clear, unlike any earthly wave, yet it rolls darkly beneath perpetual gloom, admitting neither sun nor moon.
His feet do not advance, but his eyes pass over the streamlet to survey the tender May-bloom. Suddenly, he beholds a lady all alone, singing and culling flowers. He addresses her, ""Lady beautiful! Thou, who... with love’s own beam Dost warm thee... Ah! please thee hither towards the streamlet bend Thy steps so near, that I may list thy song. Beholding thee and this fair place, methinks, I call to mind where wander’d and how look’d Proserpine, in that season, when her child The mother lost, and she the bloomy spring.""
Like a lady turning in a dance, she turns at his suit, maiden-like, veiling her sober eyes, and comes so near that he distinctly catches her dulcet sound. Arriving where the limpid waters lave the sward, she raises her eyes, which shoot splendor. She stands on the opposite bank and smiles, shifting the intermingling dyes (flowers) with her graceful fingers, which the lofty land unbosoms without seed. Only three paces separate them, yet the flood is more hateful to the narrator than the Hellespont was to Leander, because it gives no passage.
She says, ""Strangers ye come, and haply in this place, That cradled human nature in its birth, Wond’ring, ye not without suspicion view My smiles: but that sweet strain of psalmody, ‘Thou, Lord! hast made me glad,’ will give ye light, Which may uncloud your minds. And thou, who stand’st The foremost, and didst make thy suit to me, Say if aught else thou wish to hear: for I Came prompt to answer every doubt of thine.""
The narrator replies he knows not how to reconcile this wave and rustling sound with what he heard of opposite report (from Statius). She answers she will unfold the cause and purge the cloud. She explains that the ""First Good,"" whose joy is only in himself, created man for happiness and gave this place as a pledge of eternal peace. Man fell through his own defect, changing laughter and delight to bitterness. To prevent vapors from earth or waters from ascending to vex man's state, this mountain rose high toward heaven, exempt from elemental rage where the gate bars its limit. Because the circumambient air circles with its first impulse, it strikes the summit, making the wood resound. The shaken plant impregnates the voyaging breeze, which flies abroad, and the other land receives it, conceiving and producing many trees of various virtue. This explains why some plants on earth are found without apparent seed.
She further explains that this holy plain is filled with ""prolific foison of all seeds"" and bears fruit never plucked elsewhere. The water he beholds does not spring from a vein but issues from a ""fountain, solid, undecaying, sure,"" and by God's will, feeds whatever it pours on either side. On one side, it takes away remembrance of offense (Lethe); on the other, it brings back remembrance of good deeds (Eunoe). Both must be tasted. She says though his thirst may be content, she will give a corollary: those whose verse recorded the golden age on Parnassus perhaps dreamed of this place. Here was man guiltless, here perpetual spring and every fruit, and this the ""far-fam’d nectar.""
Turning to the bards, the narrator notes a smile at her conclusion, then directs his face to the lady.

**CANTO XXIX**
Singing as if enamored, she resumes and closes her song with ""Blessed they whose sins Are cover’d."" Like wood-nymphs, she moves against the current up the verdant rivage, and the narrator follows.
Not a hundred paces between them, the bank bends to face the orient. She turns to him and cries, ""My brother! look and hearken."" A sudden lustre runs across the forest, so bright he doubts it is lightning. But it endures and waxes, and a sweet melody runs through the luminous air. The narrator chides the hardihood of ""our first parent"" for not enduring restraint of any veil, which would have brought ineffable joys.
Walking in suspense through that wilderness of sweets, expectant of higher beatitude, he sees the air glow like a blazing fire under green boughs, and hears distinct melody. He invokes the ""thrice holy virgins"" (Muses) to aid him, as the verse unfolds things that mock thought.
A space onward, what seem seven trees of gold appear, but closer, he discerns them as ""tapers of gold"" and traces the sound ""Hosanna"" in the singing. Their garniture flames with more ample lustre than the moon.
The narrator turns to Virgil, who shows no less amazement. His view reverts to the lofty things moving so slowly that a bride would outstrip them. The lady (Matilda) calls aloud, ""Why thus yet burns Affection in thee for these living, lights, And dost not look on that which follows them?""
The narrator marks a tribe walking behind them, attendant on their leaders, clothed in white raiment. The watery gleam on his left reflects his left side like a mirror.
He stands on the river's edge, separated only by the stream, for a clearer prospect. He beholds the flames go onward, painting the air behind them with ""liveliest pencils,"" distinctly marked with the seven listed colors of the sun's bow and Cynthia's zone. These streaming gonfalons flow beyond his vision. Ten paces separate the outermost.
Beneath this beautiful sky, ""foul and-twenty elders"" come, two by two, crowned with flower-de-luces. All sing one song: ""Blessed be thou among The daughters of Adam! and thy loveliness Blessed for ever!"" After these, four animals come, each crowned with verdurous leaf, with six wings full of eyes. The narrator says he will not waste more rhymes on their form, but refers the reader to Ezekiel, who paints them coming from the north by Chebar's flood, in whirlwind, cloud, and fire, and such as he describes them, here they are, save for the pennons, where John accords with him.
The space surrounded by the four encloses a triumphal car on two wheels, drawn by a Gryphon. The Gryphon stretches either wing uplifted between the middle and the three listed hues on each side, so the wings cleave none. Its bird-like members are golden, the rest white with vermeil. The narrator says no car in Rome graced Augustus' or Africanus' pomp like this, not even the sun's chariot that fell at Tellus' prayer.
Three nymphs circle at the right wheel, one ruddy, one emerald, one snow-white. Now the white, now the ruddy leads, and the others take their treasure from her song. At the other wheel, a quaternion band, each in purple, advances with festive step, one conducting the rest, one with three eyes on his front. In the rear, two old men, dissimilar in raiment but alike in port and gesture, solid and grave. One shows himself a favored counselor of the ""great Coan"" (Hippocrates). His fellow marks an opposite intent, bearing a sword whose glitter and keen edge appall the narrator. Next, four others of humble seeming, and behind them all, one single old man, sleeping as he comes, with a shrewd visage. These seven are habited like the first troop but wear no lilies, rather roses and vermeil flowers, appearing as if on fire above their brow.
When the car is opposite him, a thundering is heard, at which the chosen multitude halts, making a solemn halt with the first ensigns.

**CANTO XXX**
As the polar light, which knows no setting or rising, stands firmly fixed, convoying each to duty, the saintly tribe in the van turn to the car. One, as if commissioned, thrice shouts, ""Come, spouse, from Libanus!"" and all the rest take up the song. The narrator compares this to the blessed rising at the last audit. A hundred ministers and messengers of eternal life spring from the sacred litter at the elder's voice. They cry, ""Blessed thou! who com’st!"" and scatter ""Unwith’ring lilies"" overhead and around.
The narrator has seen the eastern clime roseate at daybreak. Thus, in a cloud of flowers from angelic hands, falling within and outside the car, a virgin appears in his view, veiled in white with an olive wreath, beneath a green mantle, robed in the hue of living flame.
No shuddering terror creeps over his spirit, which had long abode in her presence. His eyes no longer recognize her, yet a hidden virtue moves from her, awakening the power of ancient love within him.
No sooner does the heavenly influence, which thrilled him in childhood, smite his vision than he turns leftward to Virgil, panting like a babe seeking refuge. He would have cried, ""There is no dram of blood, That doth not quiver in me. The old flame Throws out clear tokens of reviving fire:"" but Virgil has left them, his ""best-lov’d father,"" to whom he gave himself for safety. Nothing could save his undewed cheeks from tears.
A voice says, ""Dante, weep not, that Virgil leaves thee: nay, Weep thou not yet: behooves thee feel the edge Of other sword, and thou shalt weep for that.""
Like an admiral pacing the deck, inspiring his crew, the narrator sees the virgin stationed on the left side of the car, turning at the sound of his own name. She bends her eyes toward him across the stream. Though her veil, bound with Minerva's foliage, prevents him from seeing her clearly, she adds with royal act, ""Observe me well. I am, in sooth, I am Beatrice. What! and hast thou deign’d at last Approach the mountain? knewest not, O man! Thy happiness is whole?""
His eyes fall on the clear fount, but seeing himself, he recoils to the greensward, such is the shame on his forehead. She looks with stern majesty, like a mother to her awe-struck child, a flavor of bitterness mingled in her pity. Her words break off, and the angels sing, ""In thee, O gracious Lord, my hope hath been:"" but go no farther than, ""Thou Lord, hast set My feet in ample room.""
Like snow melting in the sun-thaw, the narrator is without sigh or tear until the angels sing, their warbling chiming with heaven's sphere. When their ""dulcet symphony"" expresses soft compassion for him, the ice congealed about his bosom turns to spirit and water, gushing forth from his lips and eyelids.
Beatrice stands immovable on the chariot's right edge and addresses the bright semblances, ""Ye in th’ eternal day your vigils keep... thence with more heed I shape mine answer, for his ear intended, Who there stands weeping, that the sorrow now May equal the transgression."" She explains that not only through the mighty orbs but through ""benign Largess of heav’nly graces,"" the narrator was in his freshness ""so gifted virtually, that in him All better habits wond’rously had thriv’d."" The more kindly strength in the soil, the more evil seed and lack of culture mar it. Her looks sometimes upheld him, as she showed her youthful eyes and led him by their light. But as she reached the threshold of her second age and changed her mortal for immortal, he left her and gave himself to others. When she rose from flesh to spirit, with increased beauty and virtue, she was less dear to him. His steps turned to deceitful ways, following false images of good. Her inspirations, in dreams and otherwise, availed not to call him back. He fell so deep that only his viewing the ""children of perdition"" could preserve him. To this end, she visited the ""purlieus of the dead,"" and Virgil received her supplications. It would be a breaking of God's decree if Lethe were passed and its food tasted ""Without the cost of some repentant tear.""

**CANTO XXXI**
Beatrice turns her words to the narrator, asking him, ""Say thou, who stand’st beyond the holy stream, If this be true. A charge so grievous needs Thine own avowal."" Such amazement hangs on his faculty that his voice expires imperfectly.
After a little space, she asks, ""What dost thou muse on? Answer me. The wave On thy remembrances of evil yet Hath done no injury."" A mingled sense of fear and confusion produces an imperfect ""Yea"" from his lips. Like a cross-bow bent beyond its pitch, the narrator bursts beneath the heavy load with tears and sighs, his voice slackened.
She asks, ""When my desire invited thee to love The good, which sets a bound to our aspirings, What bar of thwarting foss or linked chain Did meet thee, that thou so should’st quit the hope Of further progress, or what bait of ease Or promise of allurement led thee on Elsewhere, that thou elsewhere should’st rather wait?""
The narrator draws a bitter sigh, then wails, ""Thy fair looks withdrawn, Things present, with deceitful pleasures, turn’d My steps aside."" She replies that even if he had been silent or denied, he would not have hidden his sin, as her eye observes it. But when the sinner's cheek breaks into tears of self-accusing, justice's wheel runs counter to the edge. She tells him to lay aside his grief and listen as she unfolds how her buried flesh should have impelled him. He never saw anything in art or nature so sweet as her limbs, which are now dust. If the sweetest thing failed him with her death, what mortal thing should have tempted his wish? When he first felt the dart of perishable things, upon her departing for better realms, he should have pruned his wing to follow her, not stooped again for a slight girl or other transient gaud. The new bird awaits the fowler's aim twice or thrice, but for one with full plumes, the net is spread in vain.
The narrator stands silent and ashamed like a child, acknowledging his fault. She resumes, ""If, but to hear thus pains thee, Raise thou thy beard, and lo! what sight shall do!""
With less reluctance than a sturdy holm torn by a blast, the narrator raises his visage. By ""the beard,"" he notes the secret sting of her words.
No sooner does he lift his aspect than the vision of goodly creatures vanishes. His eyes, wavering, bend their light on Beatrice. She turns toward the Gryphon, and even under her veil, parted by the verdant rill, she appears more lovely than her former self, surpassing all others on earth. Remorseful goads shoot through him. Everything else that had beguiled him is now loathsome. The bitter consciousness smites his heart, and he falls to the ground.
When his strength returns, he finds the lady he first saw (Matilda) above him. She cries, ""Loose me not... Loose not thy hold;"" and drags him up to his neck into the stream, sweeping along swiftly like a shuttle.
Approaching the blessed shore, ""Tu asperges me"" is heard so sweetly that the narrator cannot remember or tell the sound. The beautiful dame, expanding her arms, clasps his temples and immerses him where the wave should drench him. Raising him up, she presents him, so laved, to the ""fourfold dance of lovely nymphs,"" who cover him with their arms. They say they are nymphs, and in heaven are stars, appointed as Beatrice's handmaids before earth was visited by her. They will lead him to her eyes, but the three nymphs of deeper ken will quicken his sight to scan the gladness in them. They begin their song and lead him to the Gryphon's breast, where Beatrice stands turned toward them.
They say, ""Spare not thy vision. We have stationed thee Before the emeralds, whence love erewhile Hath drawn his weapons on thee."" A thousand fervent wishes rivet his eyes on her beaming eyes, fixed toward the motionless Gryphon. As the sun strikes a mirror, the Gryphon's twofold being shines within Beatrice's orbs, varying in one figure now, now in another. The narrator muses how wondrous it seems to mark a steadfast thing mutable in its imaged semblance.
Full of amaze and joy, his soul feeding on the viand, the other three nymphs advance with a loftier line, dancing in a festive angelic ring to their own carol. Their song is, ""Turn, Beatrice! O turn Thy saintly sight on this thy faithful one, Who to behold thee many a wearisome pace Hath measur’d. Gracious at our pray’r vouchsafe Unveil to him thy cheeks: that he may mark Thy second beauty, now conceal’d."" The narrator exclaims about the splendor, saying no bard could represent her as she seemed when she revealed her charms under the ""still-chiming heaven.""

**CANTO XXXII**
The narrator's eyes are bent with eager coveting to rid them of their ten years' thirst, no other sense waking. His eyes are fenced from heed of aught, so tangled in the smile of saintly brightness. Forcibly, the sacred virgins turn his sight left, warning, ""Too fix’d a gaze!""
His vision labors, like eyes strained by the sun. But"
The Great Gatsby-F. Scott Fitzgerald,"Nick Carraway, the narrator, begins by recounting advice his father gave him about reserving judgments, a habit he generally maintains, except for Jay Gatsby, the man who gives his name to the book. Nick describes Gatsby as having an ""extraordinary gift for hope"" and ""romantic readiness.""

In the spring of 1922, Nick, a graduate of New Haven and a veteran of the Great War, moves East from the Middle West to learn the bond business. He rents a small, weather-beaten bungalow in West Egg, Long Island, situated between two enormous mansions. One of these belongs to Jay Gatsby. Across the bay, in the more fashionable East Egg, live his second cousin, Daisy Buchanan, and her wealthy, former football player husband, Tom Buchanan, whom Nick knew from college.

Nick visits the Buchanans for dinner. Tom is a physically imposing and arrogant man who expresses racist views about ""The Rise of the Coloured Empires"" and the ""Nordic race."" Daisy is charming but seems restless and cynical. Also present is Jordan Baker, a professional golfer, whom Nick finds intriguing. During dinner, the telephone rings for Tom, and Jordan reveals to Nick that Tom has a mistress in New York. Daisy, aware of Tom's infidelity, expresses a desire for her young daughter to be a ""beautiful little fool."" After dinner, Nick observes Tom and Daisy in a moment of strained intimacy. Upon returning home, Nick sees Gatsby for the first time, standing alone on his lawn, stretching his arms towards a distant green light across the bay.

Some time later, Nick travels with Tom to New York. On the way, they stop in the ""valley of ashes,"" a desolate industrial wasteland. There, Tom forces Nick to meet his mistress, Myrtle Wilson, the wife of George B. Wilson, a ""spiritless"" garage owner. Tom treats George dismissively while arranging to meet Myrtle in the city. Myrtle, a sensuous woman in her mid-thirties, joins them on the train (in a separate car to maintain discretion). In New York, they go to an apartment Tom keeps. Myrtle insists on buying a dog, which Tom buys. Nick gets drunk at the apartment as Myrtle's sister, Catherine, and a couple named McKee arrive. Myrtle's personality becomes more affected as she changes into an elaborate dress. Catherine tells Nick that Gatsby is rumored to be a relative of Kaiser Wilhelm and that Tom and Myrtle despise their spouses and wish to marry, but Daisy, she claims, is Catholic and doesn't believe in divorce. Myrtle recounts her first meeting with Tom. Later, Tom and Myrtle argue violently when Myrtle repeatedly shouts Daisy's name, and Tom breaks her nose with his open hand. The party descends into chaos, and Nick leaves.

Nick then describes Gatsby's lavish parties, which are open to all and attract hundreds of uninvited guests. Nick receives a formal invitation and attends one such party. He feels out of place and struggles to find his host. He reconnects with Jordan Baker, and they hear various rumors about Gatsby – that he killed a man, was a German spy, or was in the American army. In Gatsby's library, they meet a man with ""owl-eyed spectacles"" who is surprised to find the books are real. Later, Nick meets Gatsby himself, who is younger and more formal than Nick expected. Gatsby is called away by a phone call. Jordan reveals Gatsby claimed to be an ""Oxford man"" but she doesn't believe it. Gatsby later asks Jordan to speak to Nick about a ""big request."" As Nick leaves the party, he witnesses a car crash caused by a drunken guest.

Gatsby picks Nick up for lunch and attempts to dispel the rumors about himself by sharing his life story: he claims to be from wealthy, deceased Middle Western parents, educated at Oxford, and to have lived like a ""young rajah"" in Europe. Nick is skeptical, especially when Gatsby says he's from ""San Francisco."" Gatsby then produces a medal from Montenegro and an Oxford photograph, which temporarily convinces Nick. Gatsby reveals his ""big request"" involves Daisy and will be relayed by Jordan. On their way to New York, Gatsby is stopped for speeding but produces a white card that allows them to proceed. In New York, Gatsby introduces Nick to Meyer Wolfshiem, a gambler who fixed the 1919 World's Series and claims to have ""made"" Gatsby. Tom Buchanan unexpectedly appears, and Gatsby quickly disappears before a proper introduction can be made.

Later that afternoon, Jordan tells Nick Gatsby's story: In 1917, Gatsby, then a penniless army lieutenant, fell in love with Daisy Fay in Louisville. Daisy, after a period of waiting for Gatsby to return from the war, married the wealthy Tom Buchanan in 1919, despite a last-minute drunken attempt to call off the wedding after receiving a letter (presumably from Gatsby). After their honeymoon, Tom was involved in a car accident with a chambermaid, which made the papers. Jordan reveals that Gatsby bought his mansion in West Egg specifically to be across the bay from Daisy. Gatsby's ""big request"" is for Nick to invite Daisy to his house for tea, so Gatsby can ""come over"" and show her his house. Nick agrees, and he and Jordan share a moment of intimacy.

Nick invites Daisy to tea at his house, explicitly telling her not to bring Tom. On the day of the tea, Gatsby, extremely nervous, sends a man to cut Nick's grass and a greenhouse full of flowers. Gatsby arrives, pale and dressed in an elaborate suit. Daisy arrives shortly after. Their initial reunion is awkward and silent, with Gatsby even knocking over a clock. However, their embarrassment soon gives way to joy, and Gatsby ""literally glowed."" He takes Daisy and Nick to his mansion, where he shows Daisy his vast possessions, including his expensive shirts, which make Daisy cry, saying they are ""beautiful."" Gatsby points out the green light at the end of Daisy's dock, acknowledging that its ""colossal significance"" has now vanished. He has Klipspringer, the ""boarder,"" play the piano. As Nick prepares to leave, he realizes that Daisy, in person, ""tumbled short of his dreams"" due to the ""colossal vitality of his illusion."" Gatsby and Daisy are absorbed in each other, and Nick leaves them alone.

Gatsby stops holding his lavish parties. Nick learns that Gatsby fired his servants and replaced them with people connected to Wolfshiem to prevent gossip, as Daisy now visits ""quite often—in the afternoons."" Daisy invites Nick to lunch at her house. On a sweltering day, Nick arrives at the Buchanans' house. Daisy kisses Gatsby in front of Nick and Jordan, declaring her love. Daisy's young daughter, Pammy, is brought in, and Gatsby looks at her with surprise, as if he ""had never really believed in its existence before."" Daisy tells Gatsby he looks ""so cool,"" and Tom realizes their affair. Tom, furious, insists they all go to town.

On the way to town, Tom insists on driving Gatsby's yellow car, while Gatsby and Daisy follow in Tom's blue coupé. In Gatsby's car, Tom expresses his suspicions about Gatsby, revealing he has investigated his past. He challenges Gatsby's claim of being an ""Oxford man"" and suggests he's a bootlegger. They stop for gas at Wilson's garage in the valley of ashes. George Wilson is sick and distraught, revealing he has discovered Myrtle's infidelity and plans to move West with her. Myrtle, from an upstairs window, sees Tom and mistakes Jordan Baker for Tom's wife, her eyes wide with ""jealous terror.""

In a stifling suite at the Plaza Hotel, Tom confronts Gatsby directly. Tom challenges Gatsby's ""Oxford man"" story, which Gatsby clarifies was a five-month program for officers after the armistice. Tom then exposes Gatsby's illegal activities, revealing he sold grain alcohol through a chain of drugstores, and accuses Gatsby of leaving a business associate, Walter Chase, to go to jail. Gatsby counters that Chase was glad to make money. Tom insists Daisy loves him and never loved Gatsby. Daisy, under pressure, admits she ""did love him once—but I loved you too"" (referring to Gatsby). Gatsby pushes her to say she never loved Tom, but she tearfully confesses, ""I can't say I never loved Tom. It wouldn't be true."" Tom, regaining control, tells Gatsby that Daisy is not leaving him for a ""common swindler."" Daisy, frightened, begs to leave. Tom, with ""magnanimous scorn,"" tells Daisy and Gatsby to drive home in Gatsby's car. They leave. Nick realizes it is his 30th birthday.

Tom, Jordan, and Nick drive back to Long Island in Tom's car. As they pass the valley of ashes, they discover a fatal car accident. Myrtle Wilson has been hit and killed by a ""yellow car."" George Wilson is inconsolable, repeatedly crying ""Oh, my God!"" Michaelis, a coffee shop owner, tells the policeman that a yellow car was involved. Tom, realizing it was Gatsby's car, quickly tells Wilson and the policeman that the yellow car he was driving earlier wasn't his, but a blue coupé, and that he hasn't seen the yellow car all afternoon. Nick corroborates this. Tom then carries the distraught Wilson into his office and tells Nick to leave. Tom drives away, sobbing and calling the driver a ""God damned coward.""

Back at the Buchanan house, Nick sees Gatsby hiding in the bushes. Gatsby reveals that Daisy was driving his yellow car. She was nervous and thought driving would steady her. Myrtle rushed out, possibly thinking it was Tom, and Daisy swerved away from an oncoming car, hitting Myrtle. Gatsby says he will take the blame. He waits outside the Buchanan house to ensure Tom doesn't bother Daisy. Nick goes to the kitchen window and sees Tom and Daisy sitting intimately at the kitchen table, appearing to conspire. They are not happy or unhappy, but share an ""unmistakable air of natural intimacy."" Nick tells Gatsby it's ""all quiet"" and urges him to go home, but Gatsby refuses, wanting to wait until Daisy goes to bed, watching over nothing.

Nick cannot sleep. He goes to Gatsby's house at dawn. Gatsby tells him Daisy came to her window at 4 AM, stood for a minute, then turned out the light. Nick urges Gatsby to go away, as his car will be traced, but Gatsby refuses to leave Daisy until he knows what she will do. Gatsby then tells Nick the full story of his past: his real name was James Gatz, and he was a penniless young man who fell in love with Daisy. He took her under false pretenses, letting her believe he was wealthy. He felt ""married to her."" He went to war, and while he was at Oxford, Daisy, feeling the pressure of the world, married Tom Buchanan for his ""wholesome bulkiness"" and ""unquestionable practicality."" Gatsby returned to Louisville, penniless, and felt he had lost the ""freshest and the best"" part of his dream forever. Gatsby still insists Daisy never loved Tom.

Gatsby's gardener asks if he should drain the pool, but Gatsby tells him not to, as he hasn't used it all summer. Nick, feeling he shouldn't leave Gatsby, misses two trains. He shouts to Gatsby, ""They’re a rotten crowd. You’re worth the whole damn bunch put together."" Gatsby smiles radiantly. Nick then leaves for the city.

Jordan Baker calls Nick, saying she has left Daisy's house. She accuses Nick of having ""thrown her over"" and reminds him of their conversation about bad drivers, implying he was a bad driver and she met another bad driver (him). Nick, now thirty, admits he is too old to lie to himself. Nick tries to call Gatsby, but the line is busy, held for a long-distance call from Detroit.

Nick then recounts the events at Wilson's garage after he and Tom left. Michaelis stayed with the distraught George Wilson through the night. Wilson, in his grief, began to talk about the yellow car and revealed that Myrtle had come home bruised a couple of months ago. He found an expensive dog-leash, which confirmed his suspicions about Myrtle's secret life. Wilson concluded that the man in the yellow car ""murdered her"" by not stopping when she ran out to speak to him. Wilson, looking at the eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg, declares, ""God sees everything."" By morning, Wilson was gone. His movements are traced to West Egg, where he asked for Gatsby's house.

At 2 PM, Gatsby goes to his pool on a pneumatic mattress, having told his butler to bring any phone calls there. He also instructs that his yellow car is not to be taken out. No phone call arrives. The chauffeur hears shots. Nick arrives at Gatsby's house and rushes to the pool with the chauffeur, butler, and gardener. They find Gatsby dead, floating in the pool. The gardener then discovers Wilson's body in the grass nearby. The ""holocaust was complete.""

After Gatsby's death, police, photographers, and newspaper reporters swarm his house. Catherine, Myrtle's sister, lies at the inquest, swearing her sister never knew Gatsby and was happy with her husband, to simplify the case. Nick feels responsible for Gatsby because no one else seems to care. He tries to contact Daisy, but she and Tom have left early that afternoon with their baggage, leaving no forwarding address. Nick tries to reach Meyer Wolfshiem, who expresses shock but refuses to get ""mixed up in this thing now,"" citing ""important business."" Gatsby's father, Henry C. Gatz, arrives from Minnesota, a solemn old man who is both dismayed and proud of his son. He shows Nick a childhood book, ""Hopalong Cassidy,"" containing Gatsby's youthful ""General Resolves"" for self-improvement. Nick tries to arrange a funeral, but only Gatsby's father, the Lutheran minister, a few servants, the postman, and the ""owl-eyed man"" attend. No one else comes.

Nick decides to return West. He has a final, awkward conversation with Jordan Baker, who confirms her engagement to another man and again accuses Nick of being a ""bad driver"" in their relationship. Nick later encounters Tom Buchanan on Fifth Avenue. Tom admits he told Wilson that Gatsby owned the yellow car, claiming Wilson was ""crazy enough to kill me if I hadn’t told him who owned the car."" Tom justifies his actions, saying Gatsby ""had it coming to him"" and that Gatsby ""ran over Myrtle like you’d run over a dog and never even stopped his car."" Nick realizes Tom and Daisy are ""careless people"" who ""smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness,"" leaving others to clean up their mess. Nick shakes Tom's hand, feeling as though he's talking to a child.

Gatsby's house remains empty. Nick reflects on Gatsby's dream and the green light at the end of Daisy's dock, realizing Gatsby's dream was already behind him. The book concludes with Nick's final thought: ""So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past."""
The Iliad-Homer,"This detailed summary is based solely on the provided text of ""The Iliad,"" without external knowledge.

**Book I: The Contention of Achilles and Agamemnon**
The narrative begins in the tenth year of the Trojan War. The Greeks, having sacked neighboring towns, took two beautiful captives: Chryseïs, allotted to Agamemnon, and Briseïs, allotted to Achilles. Chryses, a priest of Apollo and father of Chryseïs, arrived at the Greek camp with gifts to ransom his daughter. Agamemnon insolently refused and dismissed the priest. Chryses then prayed to Apollo for vengeance, and the god inflicted a pestilence on the Greeks for nine days.

Achilles called a council, where the prophet Chalcas declared the plague was due to Agamemnon's refusal to return Chryseïs. Agamemnon, though furious, was forced to send her back. In revenge, he seized Briseïs from Achilles, leading to a fierce quarrel between the two leaders. Nestor attempted to pacify them, but Achilles, in discontent, withdrew himself and his Myrmidon forces from the Greek army.

Achilles complained to his mother, Thetis, who then ascended to Olympus to supplicate Jupiter. She asked Jupiter to honor her son by granting victory to the Trojans, making the Greeks realize their mistake. Jupiter granted her request, which angered Juno. A heated debate ensued between Jupiter and Juno, eventually reconciled by Vulcan, who reminded Juno of Jupiter's supreme power.

Meanwhile, Ulysses returned Chryseïs to her father in Chrysa and offered sacrifices to Apollo, appeasing the god. The Greeks returned to their camp.

**Book II: The Trial of the Army, and Catalogue of the Forces**
Jupiter, to fulfill Thetis's request, sent a deceitful dream to Agamemnon, disguised as Nestor, urging him to lead the army to battle, promising Troy's immediate fall. Agamemnon, believing he could conquer Troy without Achilles, decided to test his army's morale by proposing a return to Greece, expecting the chiefs to stop them.

When Agamemnon made his proposal, the soldiers enthusiastically agreed and rushed to prepare their ships for departure. Juno, dismayed, sent Minerva to intervene. Minerva found Ulysses and urged him to rally the Greeks. Ulysses, wielding Agamemnon's sceptre, persuaded the chiefs and chastised the common soldiers, including the insolent Thersites, whom he struck.

The assembly was recalled. Ulysses reminded the Greeks of the prophecy at Aulis concerning the nine years of war and Troy's eventual fall. Nestor then advised a general muster and division of troops by nation. Agamemnon agreed, offered a sacrifice to Jove (which was refused), and Minerva inspired the Greeks. The text then provides a detailed catalogue of the Greek forces, noting Achilles' Myrmidons were inactive. Iris, sent by Jove, warned the Trojans (disguised as Polites) of the Greek advance, and Hector rallied his forces, followed by a catalogue of Trojan and auxiliary troops.

**Book III: The Duel of Menelaus and Paris**
The armies advanced, the Trojans with shouts, the Greeks in silence. Paris, in the Trojan vanguard, challenged the bravest Greek. Menelaus eagerly stepped forward. Paris, seeing Menelaus, recoiled in fear. Hector fiercely reproached Paris for his cowardice. Paris, accepting the rebuke, proposed a single combat with Menelaus for Helen and her treasures, to end the war.

Hector announced the challenge to both armies, and Menelaus agreed, requesting Priam to oversee the oaths due to his sons' faithlessness. Heralds were sent for Priam and to fetch a lamb for sacrifice. Iris, disguised as Laodice, called Helen from her loom to the Scaean Gate to witness the duel. Priam and the Trojan elders, on the walls, acknowledged Helen's beauty but wished her gone. Helen identified Agamemnon, Ulysses, and Ajax for Priam, and lamented the absence of her brothers, Castor and Pollux, unaware they were dead.

Priam and Menelaus swore solemn oaths over sacrificed lambs. Priam then returned to Troy, unable to watch. Paris and Menelaus armed. Paris threw his spear first, which struck Menelaus's shield but did not pierce it. Menelaus's spear pierced Paris's shield and corslet, but Paris dodged the fatal blow. Menelaus then struck Paris's helmet with his sword, which broke. Menelaus seized Paris by the helmet, dragging him. Venus intervened, breaking the strap and rescuing Paris in a cloud, transporting him to his chamber.

Venus, disguised as an old woman, summoned Helen to Paris. Helen, angry at Venus, initially refused, but Venus threatened her, compelling her to obey. Helen found Paris in his chamber, reproached him, but then embraced him. Agamemnon, unable to find Paris, declared Menelaus the victor and demanded Helen's return and the fine. The Greeks applauded.

**Book IV: The Breach of the Truce, and the First Battle**
In a council of the gods, Jupiter provoked Juno by suggesting peace. Juno, insistent on Troy's destruction, received Jupiter's reluctant consent, with a warning against future interference with his favored cities. Jupiter sent Minerva to break the truce. Minerva, disguised as Laodocus, persuaded Pandarus to shoot an arrow at Menelaus. The arrow wounded Menelaus in the shoulder, drawing blood, but Minerva deflected it from being fatal.

Agamemnon expressed sorrow and fear for Menelaus, foretelling Troy's doom. Machaon tended to Menelaus's wound. The Trojans, seeing the truce broken, rushed to attack. Agamemnon rallied his troops, praising the brave and shaming the fearful. Nestor organized his forces. Diomed and Ulysses, initially reproved, affirmed their readiness to fight.

The battle began with great clamor, inspired by Discord, Mars, and Minerva. Antilochus, Meges, Idomeneus, Menelaus, Merion, and Eurypylus each slew Trojan chiefs. Diomed raged across the field, killing Astynous, Hypenor, Xanthus, Thoon, and two sons of Priam. Pandarus shot Diomed, wounding him, but Minerva strengthened Diomed and granted him the ability to distinguish gods from mortals, allowing him to fight any god except Venus.

Æneas joined Pandarus in a chariot to confront Diomed. Pandarus's spear failed to wound Diomed, but Diomed's spear, guided by Pallas, killed Pandarus. Æneas tried to defend the body, but Diomed struck him with a stone, felling him. Venus rescued Æneas in a cloud. Diomed pursued Venus and wounded her hand. Venus, shrieking, dropped Æneas, who was then carried by Apollo to his temple in Troy for healing. Diomed insulted Venus. Venus, aided by Iris, fled to Mars, who lent her his chariot to return to Olympus. Dione comforted Venus, reminding her that gods also suffer.

Jupiter, seeing Venus's complaint, told her to stick to love. Apollo, from Troy, urged Mars to rally the Trojans, creating a phantom of Æneas to inspire them. Mars, disguised as Acamas, and Sarpedon rallied the Trojans. Æneas, healed, returned to battle. The fighting continued with many deaths on both sides. Diomed, seeing Mars, ordered a slow retreat. Ajax killed Amphius. Tlepolemus challenged Sarpedon; Sarpedon killed Tlepolemus, but was himself wounded. Ulysses killed several Lycians. Hector rallied the Trojans, aided by Mars and Bellona.

Juno and Minerva descended to aid the Greeks, but Jupiter sent Iris to warn them, threatening punishment if they interfered. They reluctantly obeyed. Jupiter reaffirmed his plan for Hector to conquer until Achilles returned after Patroclus's death. Night fell, and the Trojans, victorious, camped on the plain, lighting fires to prevent the Greeks from escaping.

**Book IX: The Embassy to Achilles**
The Greeks were filled with despair. Agamemnon, weeping, proposed abandoning the siege. Diomed vehemently opposed this, vowing to fight on. Nestor praised Diomed and advised Agamemnon to strengthen the guards and call a council of elders. Agamemnon followed this, and Nestor then proposed sending an embassy to Achilles to appease him.

Agamemnon agreed, acknowledging his fault, and offered immense gifts: gold, vases, tripods, horses, seven Lesbian captives (including Briseïs, whom he swore he had not touched), and if Troy fell, twenty Trojan women and one of his daughters in marriage with seven rich cities as dowry. Ulysses, Ajax, and Phoenix, accompanied by heralds, were chosen as ambassadors.

They found Achilles playing the harp with Patroclus. Achilles welcomed them. After a feast, Ulysses presented Agamemnon's offer, reminding Achilles of his father's advice to control his anger and appealing to his duty to save Greece. Achilles rejected the offer, expressing his deep hatred for Agamemnon's deceit and announcing his intention to return home on the third day. He advised the Greeks to do the same, stating he would only fight if Hector's flames threatened his own ships.

Phoenix then recounted his history of raising Achilles and urged him to temper his rage, telling the story of Meleager, who fought only after his city was in dire straits and received no reward. Achilles refused to be swayed, but invited Phoenix to stay. Ajax, impatient, reproached Achilles for his stubbornness over a single woman. Achilles reiterated his refusal to fight until his own ships were threatened. The ambassadors returned to the Greek camp and reported Achilles' rejection. Diomed advised the Greeks to prepare for battle without Achilles.

**Book X: The Night-Adventure of Diomed and Ulysses**
Agamemnon, sleepless with anxiety, met Menelaus, also sleepless. Agamemnon sent Menelaus to wake Ajax and Idomeneus, while he went to Nestor. Nestor, awake and armed, advised waking Ulysses and Diomed. The chiefs met and Nestor proposed sending a spy into the Trojan camp. Diomed volunteered, choosing Ulysses as his companion.

Diomed and Ulysses armed themselves. Minerva sent a heron as an omen, and they prayed to her. Meanwhile, Hector offered Achilles' chariot and horses as a reward to any Trojan who would spy on the Greek camp. Dolon, a swift but vain Trojan, volunteered, asking for Achilles' horses. Hector swore an oath (in vain) to grant him the prize. Dolon set out, dressed in a wolf's hide.

Diomed and Ulysses spotted Dolon, let him pass, then pursued and captured him. Dolon, terrified, begged for his life and revealed Hector's offer and the disposition of the Trojan and auxiliary forces, particularly mentioning Rhesus and his white horses. Diomed then killed Dolon, saying he could not be allowed to spy again. Ulysses dedicated Dolon's spoils to Pallas and marked the spot.

The two heroes proceeded to the Thracian camp, found Rhesus and his men sleeping, and Diomed slaughtered Rhesus and twelve of his warriors. Ulysses gathered Rhesus's magnificent white horses. Pallas appeared, urging them to return. They rode the horses back to the Greek camp, where Nestor greeted them. Ulysses recounted their success. The horses were taken to Diomed's stalls, and Dolon's armor was dedicated to Minerva. The heroes cleansed themselves and feasted.

**Book XI: The Third Battle, and the Acts of Agamemnon**
At dawn, Eris, sent by Jove, descended to the Greek fleet, inspiring them to battle. Agamemnon armed himself in splendid, divine armor and led the charge. Jove sent drops of blood, foretelling slaughter. The Trojans, led by Hector, Polydamas, and Æneas, met the Greeks. Agamemnon raged, killing Bienor, Oileus, two sons of Priam (Isus and Antiphus), and the sons of Antimachus (Pisander and his brother).

Jupiter, from Ida, sent Iris to Hector, commanding him to retreat while Agamemnon was in his fury, but to return to battle once Agamemnon was wounded and withdrew. Hector obeyed. Agamemnon continued his slaughter, killing Iphidamas and Coön (who wounded Agamemnon in the arm). Agamemnon, in pain from his wound, withdrew from the battle.

Hector, seeing Agamemnon's retreat, rallied the Trojans and led a fierce charge, killing many Greeks. Ulysses and Diomed rallied, checking Hector. Diomed killed several Trojan chiefs, including the sons of Merops and Agastrophus. Paris then shot Diomed in the foot with an arrow, forcing him to withdraw. Ulysses was left alone, surrounded, but fought valiantly, killing several Trojans, including Socus, who wounded him. Menelaus and Ajax rescued Ulysses.

Ajax killed Doryclus, Pandocus, and Lysander. Hector raged on the left wing. Paris wounded Machaon with an arrow. Idomeneus told Nestor to take Machaon to the ships for healing. Nestor departed with Machaon. Hector then drove his chariot to the right wing, scattering the Greeks. Jove filled Ajax with terror, causing him to retreat slowly. Eurypylus aided Ajax but was wounded by Paris. Patroclus, seeing Nestor with Machaon, was sent by Achilles to inquire about the wounded. Patroclus found Nestor, who recounted the Greek losses and urged Patroclus to lead the Myrmidons in Achilles' armor to save the fleet. Patroclus, moved, left to deliver the message. On his way, he met the wounded Eurypylus and tended to his wound.

**Book XII: The Battle at the Grecian Wall**
While Patroclus tended Eurypylus, the battle raged at the Greek fortifications. The narrator foretold the future destruction of the Greek wall by Neptune and Apollo. Hector led the Trojans, who were eager to cross the trench and wall. Polydamas advised Hector to dismount and attack on foot, which Hector accepted. The Trojans divided into five battalions. Asius, however, disobeyed and drove his chariot to the gates, where he was met by Polypoetes and Leonteus, who defended the gates and killed many Trojans.

An omen appeared: an eagle dropping a bleeding serpent. Polydamas interpreted this as a sign of temporary success but ultimate failure and advised retreat. Hector rejected this, trusting Jove's clear favor. Hector rallied the Trojans, and with Jove's aid, they renewed the assault. The Ajaces rallied the Greeks. Sarpedon, inspired by Jove, led the Lycians, boasting of his leadership. Menestheus called for the Ajaces and Teucer. Ajax the Greater killed Epicles with a stone. Teucer wounded Glaucus with an arrow. Sarpedon killed Alcmaon and then tore down a section of the wall.

The battle raged fiercely at the breach. Teucer and Ajax shot at Sarpedon, but Jove protected him. Sarpedon rallied his Lycians. The fight remained evenly matched until Hector, with Jove's aid, threw a massive stone at the Greek gates, shattering them. Hector burst through, leading the Trojans into the Greek camp. The Greeks trembled and fled towards their ships.

**Book XIII: The Fourth Battle Continued, in which Neptune Assists the Greeks: The Acts of Idomeneus**
Jupiter, having brought Hector to the Greek ships, turned his attention away. Neptune, seeing the Greek distress, rose from the sea, disguised as Calchas, and inspired the Ajaces and other Greek leaders. The Ajaces recognized the divine presence and felt renewed strength. Neptune rallied the routed Greeks, shaming them and urging them to fight. The Greeks formed a phalanx.

Hector led the charge. Merion's spear broke against Deiphobus's shield, and he went for another. Teucer killed Imbrius. Hector's spear missed Teucer and killed Amphimachus (Neptune's grandson). Ajax the Greater killed Imbrius and threw his head at Hector's feet. Neptune, enraged, further inspired the Greeks, particularly Idomeneus. Idomeneus, after tending to a wounded soldier, returned to battle with Merion. Idomeneus killed Othryoneus and Asius. Antilochus killed Asius's charioteer. Deiphobus's spear missed Idomeneus and killed Hypsenor. Idomeneus killed Alcathous.

Æneas, persuaded by Deiphobus, confronted Idomeneus. Idomeneus called for his allies. Æneas's spear missed Idomeneus, who then killed Oenomaus. Idomeneus, heavy with age, slowly withdrew. Deiphobus's spear missed Idomeneus and killed Ascalaphus (son of Mars). Merion wounded Deiphobus. Æneas killed Aphareus. Antilochus killed Thoon. Merion killed Adamas. Helenus wounded Deipyrus. Menelaus wounded Helenus and killed Pisander, boasting of his vengeance. Menelaus killed Harpalion. Paris killed Euchenor.

The Greeks gained ground on the left wing, aided by Neptune. Hector remained in the center. The Locrian archers rained arrows on the Trojans. Polydamas advised Hector to call a council, fearing Achilles' return. Hector, after reproaching Paris, agreed to the council but first went to rally the left wing. Hector and Ajax exchanged boasts, and an eagle omen favored the Greeks.

**Book XIV: Juno Deceives Jupiter by the Girdle of Venus**
Nestor, hearing the battle's clamor, left Machaon to be tended and went to the front, seeing the wall in ruins and Greeks in flight. He met the wounded Agamemnon, Ulysses, and Diomed. Agamemnon proposed abandoning the siege. Ulysses fiercely rebuked him, and Diomed advised them to return to the front to inspire the troops, but to stay out of range. The wounded kings agreed. Neptune, disguised as an old warrior, encouraged Agamemnon.

Juno, seeing Jupiter on Ida favoring the Trojans, decided to deceive him. She adorned herself with great care and obtained Venus's magic girdle of love and desire. She then went to Sleep, on Lemnos, and persuaded him to put Jupiter to sleep, promising him Pasithaë, the youngest Grace, as his wife, and swearing a solemn oath. Sleep and Juno flew to Mount Ida. Juno approached Jupiter, who was immediately enchanted by her beauty and fell into a deep slumber.

Sleep swiftly informed Neptune, who then openly aided the Greeks, rallying them. Hector threw his javelin at Ajax, but it was deflected. Ajax threw a huge stone, striking Hector in the chest and knocking him unconscious. The Greeks rejoiced. Polydamas, Agenor, and Æneas protected Hector, carrying him from the field to Troy. Hector revived by the Xanthus river. The Greeks pressed their attack, killing many Trojans.

**Book XV: The Fifth Battle at the Ships; and the Acts of Ajax**
Jupiter, waking on Ida, saw the Trojans fleeing, Hector in a swoon, and Neptune leading the Greeks. Enraged at Juno's deception, he threatened her. Juno denied involvement, blaming Neptune. Jupiter, appeased, revealed his plan: Iris would command Neptune to withdraw, Apollo would revive Hector and lead the Trojans to drive the Greeks to Achilles' ships. Patroclus would then fight in Achilles' armor, kill Sarpedon, but then be killed by Hector. Only then would Achilles return, and Troy would fall.

Juno flew to Olympus, warned Mars against fighting Jove, and sent Iris and Apollo to Ida. Iris delivered Jove's command to Neptune, who, though angry, reluctantly withdrew. Apollo revived Hector, inspired him, and gave him Jove's aegis. Hector, invigorated, led the Trojans back to battle. Apollo, with the aegis, broke down the Greek wall.

The Trojans rushed into the Greek camp. Hector killed many Greeks and forbade plundering, urging his troops to burn the ships. Apollo pushed down the trench, creating a path. The Trojans poured into the camp, reaching the ships. Nestor prayed to Jove, who sent thunder as a sign. Patroclus, seeing the ships burning, rushed to Achilles.

The battle raged around the ships. Hector and Ajax fought at one ship. Hector killed Clytius. Hector's javelin killed Lycophron, Ajax's servant. Ajax called to Teucer, who shot an arrow, killing Clytus. Teucer aimed at Hector, but Jove broke his bowstring. Ajax told Teucer to use a spear. Hector rallied the Trojans. Ajax rallied the Greeks. Dolops wounded Meges, but Menelaus killed Dolops. Antilochus killed Melanippus. Jove continued to favor the Trojans. Hector, like a lion, killed Periphes. Nestor rallied the Greeks. Minerva cleared the mist from their eyes. Ajax, with a huge mace, defended the ships. Hector seized the stern of Protesilaus's ship and called for fire. Ajax, overwhelmed, retreated slightly but continued to defend, killing twelve Trojans.

**Book XVI: The Sixth Battle, the Acts and Death of Patroclus**
Patroclus, seeing the ships burning, wept before Achilles. He pleaded with Achilles to let him lead the Myrmidons in Achilles' armor to save the fleet. Achilles, though still angry at Agamemnon, agreed, but strictly ordered Patroclus not to pursue the Trojans to the walls of Troy or engage Hector. He wished for all Trojans and Greeks to die, leaving only them to take Troy.

Ajax, his spear broken by Hector, retreated as the Trojans set fire to Protesilaus's ship. Achilles, seeing the flames, urged Patroclus to arm. Patroclus donned Achilles' armor (except for his spear). Automedon harnessed Achilles' immortal horses. Achilles rallied the Myrmidons and made a libation to Jove, praying for Patroclus's success and safe return, but Jove granted only the former.

Patroclus led the Myrmidons. The Trojans, seeing Achilles' armor, panicked and fled from the ships. Patroclus extinguished the fire. Patroclus raged, killing Pyrechmes and many other Trojan chiefs, driving them from the ships. Patroclus pursued the fleeing Trojans. Sarpedon, seeing his Lycians fall, challenged Patroclus. Jove debated saving his son Sarpedon, but Juno persuaded him to let fate take its course.

Patroclus killed Thrasymed. Sarpedon wounded Achilles' mortal horse, Pedasus. Automedon cut Pedasus free. Patroclus then killed Sarpedon with a spear to the heart. Sarpedon, dying, called to Glaucus to defend his body. Glaucus, wounded, prayed to Apollo, who healed him. Glaucus rallied the Trojans and Lycians to defend Sarpedon's body. Hector rushed to the body. A fierce battle ensued over Sarpedon's corpse. The Greeks eventually gained the body and stripped Sarpedon's armor. Jove sent Apollo to retrieve Sarpedon's body, cleanse it, and have Sleep and Death carry it to Lycia for burial.

Patroclus, disregarding Achilles' command, pursued the Trojans to the walls of Troy, killing many. Thrice he attempted to scale the walls, and thrice Apollo repulsed him, warning him to retreat. Hector, urged by Apollo (disguised as Asius), drove his chariot towards Patroclus. Patroclus killed Cebriones, Hector's charioteer, with a stone. A battle raged over Cebriones' body. As the sun set, the Greeks gained the advantage.

Patroclus, with renewed fury, charged the Trojans. Apollo, shrouded in a cloud, struck Patroclus from behind, disarming and stunning him. Euphorbus then wounded Patroclus with a spear. Hector, seeing Patroclus disarmed and wounded, approached and killed him with a spear. Hector boasted over Patroclus's dying body. Patroclus, with his last breath, prophesied Hector's imminent death by Achilles. Patroclus died. Hector pulled his spear from the body. Automedon drove Achilles' immortal horses away.

**Book XVII: The Seventh Battle, for the Body of Patroclus**
Menelaus defended Patroclus's body. Euphorbus challenged him and was killed by Menelaus. Menelaus began to strip Euphorbus's armor. Apollo, disguised as Mentes, urged Hector to retrieve Patroclus's body and Achilles' armor. Hector rushed forward. Menelaus, seeing Hector, retreated, calling for Ajax. Ajax arrived. Hector, who had seized Patroclus's head, retreated with Achilles' armor, which his men carried to Troy. Ajax covered Patroclus's body.

Glaucus reproached Hector for his flight and for abandoning Sarpedon's body. Hector, stung, denied cowardice and put on Achilles' armor. Jove pitied Hector, granting him a day of glory. Hector, filled with divine vigor, rallied the Trojans, promising honors for retrieving Patroclus's body. Ajax called for the bravest Greeks to defend the body. Ajax the Lesser, Idomeneus, and Merion responded. The battle raged over Patroclus's body. Hippothous attempted to drag the body but was killed by Ajax. Hector's spear killed Schedius. Ajax killed Phorcys.

Apollo, disguised as Periphas, urged Æneas to fight. Æneas rallied the Trojans. Leocritus was killed by Æneas. Lycomedes killed Apisaon. The Greeks formed a strong defense around Patroclus's body. Automedon, Achilles' charioteer, mourned Patroclus, and Achilles' immortal horses wept. Jove pitied the horses and gave them new spirit, ensuring Automedon's safe return. Alcimedon took the reins, allowing Automedon to fight. Hector and Æneas attempted to capture Achilles' chariot. Automedon killed Aretus. The Ajaces intervened, forcing Hector and Æneas to retreat.

Minerva, disguised as Phoenix, inspired Menelaus, who then killed Podes. Apollo, disguised as Phaenops, urged Hector to return to the body. Hector rushed back. Jove shook his aegis, terrifying the Greeks. Peneleus and Leitus were wounded. Hector killed Coeranus, Merion's charioteer. Merion and Idomeneus retreated. Ajax, seeing Jove's hand, prayed for light, which Jove granted. Ajax told Menelaus to send Antilochus to Achilles with the news of Patroclus's death. Menelaus found Antilochus, who was overcome with grief, and sent him to Achilles. Menelaus returned to the battle, and he and Merion, aided by the Ajaces, lifted Patroclus's body and began to carry it to the ships, fiercely fighting off the pursuing Trojans.

**Book XVIII: The Grief of Achilles, and New Armour Made Him by Vulcan**
Achilles, by his ships, foresaw Patroclus's death. Antilochus arrived, weeping, and delivered the news of Patroclus's death and Hector's possession of Achilles' armor. Achilles was overwhelmed with grief, covering himself in ashes and tearing his hair. The captive women lamented with him. Thetis, hearing his cries, came with the Nereids to comfort him. Achilles expressed his desire for revenge on Hector, acknowledging his own fated death after Hector's. Thetis promised to bring him new divine armor from Vulcan by dawn.

The battle for Patroclus's body continued. Juno sent Iris to Achilles, urging him to appear at the trench, even unarmed, to scare the Trojans and save the body. Achilles agreed. Pallas threw her aegis over his shoulder and created a golden cloud with a flame above his head. Achilles stood on the rampart and shouted. Minerva amplified his voice, terrifying the Trojans, who dropped their arms and fled. Twelve Trojans were crushed in the panic. The Greeks then retrieved Patroclus's body and carried it to Achilles' tent. Achilles lamented over the body.

Night fell. The Trojans held a council. Polydamas advised retreating into the city, fearing Achilles. Hector rejected this, insisting on camping on the plain to attack the ships at dawn, confident he could face Achilles. Pallas made the Trojans approve Hector's bad advice. The Greeks mourned Patroclus all night. Achilles vowed to sacrifice twelve Trojan captives on Patroclus's pyre and leave Hector's body to dogs.

Thetis arrived at Vulcan's palace on Olympus and requested new armor for Achilles. Vulcan, recounting how Thetis had saved him in the past, agreed to forge magnificent armor. He created a massive, solid shield depicting: earth, heaven, ocean, celestial bodies; two cities (one at peace, one at war); a ploughed field; a harvest field; a vineyard; a herd of oxen attacked by lions; a pasture; and a dancing floor. He also forged a cuirass, greaves, and a helmet. Thetis took the blazing new armor and flew swiftly to Achilles.

**Book XIX: The Reconciliation of Achilles and Agamemnon**
At dawn, Thetis brought the divine armor to Achilles. Achilles was awed by its splendor. He expressed concern about Patroclus's body decaying, but Thetis assured him she would preserve it with nectar and ambrosia. She told him to assemble the Greeks and end his wrath. Achilles obeyed, calling the Greeks to assembly. Diomed, Ulysses, and Agamemnon arrived.

Achilles publicly declared an end to his anger, wishing the quarrel over Briseïs had never happened. He expressed his readiness to fight. The Greeks cheered. Agamemnon, without rising, explained that Jove, Fate, and Ate were responsible for his past error. He reaffirmed his offer of gifts and Briseïs, swearing he had not touched her. Achilles accepted the end of the quarrel but was impatient to fight, refusing to eat until he had avenged Patroclus.

Ulysses advised Achilles to let the army eat and rest to regain strength, and to formally accept the gifts and oath. Agamemnon agreed, ordering the gifts to be brought and the oath to be sworn publicly. Achilles reluctantly agreed to the delay. Ulysses and other chiefs brought the gifts, including Briseïs. Agamemnon publicly swore his oath over a sacrificed boar. Achilles reiterated that Jove caused their strife and urged the Greeks to eat.

The Greeks dispersed to eat. Achilles returned to his tent. Briseïs, seeing Patroclus's body, lamented over him, recalling his kindness. The other captive women joined her. Achilles refused to eat, consumed by grief. Jupiter, seeing Achilles' distress, sent Minerva to infuse ambrosia and nectar into his breast, strengthening him.

The Greek army armed for battle. Achilles donned his new divine armor, his eyes flashing with fire. He addressed his immortal horses, Xanthus and Balius, reproaching them for leaving Patroclus. Xanthus, miraculously given voice by Juno, replied that Patroclus's death was due to a god and fate, and prophesied Achilles' own imminent death. Achilles, undaunted, declared he knew his fate and rushed to battle.

**Book XX: The Battle of the Gods, and the Acts of Achilles**
The Greek and Trojan armies prepared for battle. Jupiter called a council of the gods, permitting them to assist either side, fearing Achilles would take Troy against fate. The gods descended: Juno, Neptune, Minerva, Hermes, and Vulcan aided the Greeks; Latona, Apollo, Mars, Diana, and Xanthus aided the Trojans. Their arrival caused immense tumult, shaking earth and heaven, and even Pluto in the underworld trembled.

The gods engaged in their own battles: Apollo against Neptune, Mars against Pallas, Latona against Hermes, Diana against Juno, Vulcan against Xanthus (Scamander). Achilles, seeking Hector, burst through the ranks. Apollo, disguised as Lycaon, urged Æneas to confront Achilles. Æneas, though reluctant, advanced. Juno, seeing this, called a council of the Greek-favoring gods. Neptune suggested they observe unless the Trojan gods intervened.

Æneas and Achilles confronted each other, exchanging boasts. Æneas's spear struck Achilles' shield but did not pierce it. Achilles' spear pierced Æneas's shield. As Achilles rushed Æneas, Neptune intervened, casting darkness over Achilles' eyes, retrieving his spear, and carrying Æneas away, warning him not to fight Achilles again until Achilles' fated death. Neptune then dispelled the mist from Achilles' eyes. Achilles, amazed, realized a god had saved Æneas.

Achilles then unleashed his fury on the rest of the Trojans. Hector rallied the Trojans, but Apollo warned him to avoid single combat with Achilles. Hector obeyed. Achilles killed Iphytion, Demoleon, Hippodamas, and Polydore (Priam's youngest son). Hector, enraged by Polydore's death, confronted Achilles. Hector threw his spear, but Pallas deflected it. Achilles rushed Hector, but Apollo shrouded Hector in a cloud, saving him. Thrice Achilles struck the cloud in vain, raging at Apollo. Achilles then continued his slaughter, killing many more Trojans.

**Book XXI: The Battle in the River Scamander**
The Trojans fled before Achilles, some towards the town (shrouded by Juno), others towards the river Xanthus (Scamander). Achilles drove the latter into the river, where many drowned. He took twelve Trojan youths alive as captives for Patroclus's shade. Achilles then encountered Lycaon, a son of Priam he had previously captured and sold. Lycaon begged for mercy, but Achilles, hardened by Patroclus's death, refused and killed him, casting his body into the river.

The river god Xanthus, enraged by the choked stream, confronted Achilles, telling him to stop. Achilles refused, vowing to continue until Troy and Hector fell. Achilles then killed Asteropeus, a Paeonian leader, boasting of his divine lineage over Asteropeus's river-god lineage. Achilles pursued the Paeonians. Scamander, enraged, rose in human form and confronted Achilles again, then swelled his waters, creating a flood that swept Achilles away.

Achilles struggled against the current, lamenting his ignominious fate. Neptune and Pallas appeared, reassuring him and urging him to continue fighting. Achilles, invigorated, resumed his rampage. Scamander called to Simois for aid, and they combined their floods, threatening to bury Achilles. Juno, fearing for Achilles, called to Vulcan for aid. Vulcan unleashed his fires on the river, consuming the dead, drying the soil, and boiling the water. Scamander, in pain, begged Vulcan to cease, yielding to fate. Juno ordered Vulcan to stop, and the river returned to normal.

The other gods engaged in battle: Minerva struck Mars down with a stone. Venus aided Mars, but Minerva struck her too. Neptune challenged Apollo, but Apollo refused to fight for mortals. Diana upbraided Apollo, and Juno seized Diana, disarming and beating her. Latona collected Diana's arrows. Hermes declined to fight Latona. The gods returned to Olympus. Apollo entered Troy to protect its walls. Achilles continued his slaughter, driving the Trojans towards the city. Priam ordered the gates opened to let the Trojans in, then closed. Apollo covered the Trojans' retreat. Apollo, disguised as Agenor, challenged Achilles, allowing the real Agenor to escape and the remaining Trojans to enter the city. Achilles, realizing the deception, was enraged.

**Book XXII: The Death of Hector**
The Trojans were safe within their walls, except for Hector, who stood alone before the Scaean Gate, resolved to face Achilles. Apollo mocked Achilles for chasing him. Achilles, enraged, advanced towards Troy. Priam and Hecuba, from the walls, pleaded with Hector to come inside, fearing his death and Troy's ruin. Hector, however, remained resolute, debating retreat or parley, but ultimately resolving to fight gloriously.

Achilles approached, blazing like a star. Hector's resolve failed, and he fled in terror. Achilles pursued Hector three times around the walls of Troy. The gods observed. Jupiter weighed their fates; Hector's scale sank. Apollo abandoned Hector. Minerva descended, disguised as Deiphobus, and urged Hector to stand and fight Achilles together. Hector, believing he had an ally, agreed and faced Achilles, proposing an oath for the return of the loser's body. Achilles fiercely rejected any oaths, declaring his sole purpose was vengeance for Patroclus.

Achilles launched his javelin, which Hector dodged. Minerva retrieved the spear and returned it to Achilles, unseen by Hector. Hector, believing he had wounded Achilles and that Deiphobus would give him another spear, called for Deiphobus, but he was not there. Hector realized he had been deceived and accepted his fate, drawing his sword. Achilles, with his spear, found the vulnerable spot in Hector's armor (Patroclus's old armor) at the neck and drove his spear through it, wounding him mortally but allowing him to speak.

Achilles boasted over the dying Hector, refusing his plea for burial and vowing his body to dogs. Hector, with his dying breath, prophesied Achilles' death at the Scaean Gate by Paris and Apollo. Hector died. Achilles stripped his armor. The other Greeks gathered, marveling at Hector, and stabbed his body. Achilles declared victory and, in an act of vengeance, bored Hector's ankles, threaded thongs through them, and bound him to his chariot. He then dragged Hector's body three times around Patroclus's tomb.

Priam and Hecuba, from the walls, witnessed this horror and lamented loudly, joined by the entire city. Priam tried to rush out but was restrained. Andromache, unaware, heard the cries, felt a premonition, and rushed to the walls. She saw Hector's body being dragged, fainted, and then awoke to lament his death, foreseeing Troy's fall and her son Astyanax's suffering and enslavement. She vowed to burn the clothes she had woven for Hector.

**Book XXIII: Funeral Games in Honour of Patroclus**
The Greeks returned to their ships. Achilles gathered the Myrmidons and ordered them to drive their chariots thrice around Patroclus's body. Achilles lamented over Patroclus, reaffirming his promise to give Hector's body to dogs and sacrifice twelve Trojan captives on the pyre. He threw Hector's body before the bier. The Myrmidons then gathered for a funeral feast. Achilles refused to wash until Patroclus was buried. He agreed to eat but requested Agamemnon to prepare the funeral pyre at dawn.

The Greeks feasted and slept. Achilles, sleepless, lay on the shore. Patroclus's ghost appeared to him in a dream, asking for burial rites so his spirit could rest and requesting that their bones be mixed. Achilles tried to embrace the ghost, but it vanished. He awoke, amazed.

At dawn, Agamemnon sent men to Mount Ida to cut timber for the pyre. The timber was brought back and arranged. The Myrmidons, armed, drove their chariots around the pyre. Achilles, supporting Patroclus's head, lamented and cut off a lock of his hair, vowed to Sperchius, placing it on Patroclus's body. Agamemnon dismissed most of the troops. The chiefs built a large pyre. Patroclus's body was placed on top, covered in fat, along with sacrificed sheep, oxen, goats, and four horses. Achilles then sacrificed twelve Trojan captives on the pyre.

Achilles invoked Patroclus's ghost. Venus and Apollo protected Hector's body from dogs and decay. The pyre did not burn, so Achilles prayed to the Winds (Zephyr and Boreas). Iris, sent by Achilles, went to the Winds, who then rushed forth, igniting the pyre. The pyre burned all night. At dawn, the flames subsided. Achilles, exhausted, slept. The Greeks gathered, and Achilles ordered them to quench the embers, collect Patroclus's bones in a golden urn, and bury them in a mound, which would be their common tomb.

Achilles then announced funeral games with various prizes.
1.  **Chariot Race:** Eumelus, Diomed, Menelaus, Antilochus, Merion competed. Apollo hindered Diomed, but Pallas helped him and caused Eumelus to crash. Diomed won first prize. Achilles awarded Eumelus second prize out of pity, but Antilochus protested, having come in second by a clever maneuver against Menelaus. Menelaus challenged Antilochus to an oath, but Antilochus humbly yielded the prize. Achilles gave Antilochus a golden talent and Eumelus a corslet. Nestor received a double bowl as an honorary gift.
2.  **Boxing:** Epeus defeated Euryalus.
3.  **Wrestling:** Ajax the Greater and Ulysses competed to a draw, sharing the prizes.
4.  **Foot-Race:** Oilean Ajax, Ulysses, and Antilochus competed. Pallas tripped Ajax, allowing Ulysses to win. Antilochus came in third.
5.  **Single Combat (Spear and Shield):** Diomed and Ajax the Greater competed. The Greeks stopped the fight, declaring equal honors, but Diomed received a sword as the victor's due.
6.  **Discus Throw:** Polypoetes won the iron quoit.
7.  **Archery:** Teucer cut the cord but missed the dove. Merion, praying to Apollo, shot the dove. Merion won the double-edged axes, Teucer the single-edged.
8.  **Javelin Throw:** Achilles awarded the prize to Agamemnon without contest, and a spear to Merion.

**Book XXIV: The Redemption of the Body of Hector**
After the games, the Greeks slept, but Achilles remained sleepless, mourning Patroclus. Each morning, he dragged Hector's body thrice around Patroclus's tomb. Apollo protected Hector's body from damage and decay. The gods were moved by pity. On the tenth day, Apollo condemned Achilles' cruelty in the council of the gods. Juno defended Achilles. Jupiter intervened, acknowledging Hector's piety, and ordered Thetis to tell Achilles to accept ransom. He then sent Iris to Priam, instructing him to go alone with a herald and gifts to Achilles' tent to ransom Hector's body, promising Hermes' protection.

Iris delivered the message to Thetis, who then went to Achilles, telling him Jove's command. Achilles agreed to obey. Iris delivered Jove's message to Priam in Troy. Priam, despite Hecuba's fears, insisted on going, trusting Jove. He gathered rich gifts. Priam angrily reproached his surviving sons. Priam's sons prepared the car and loaded the gifts. Priam himself harnessed his horses, aided by Idæus. Hecuba offered a libation and asked for an omen. Jove sent an eagle as a favorable sign.

Priam and Idæus set out. Jove sent Hermes, disguised as a young man, to guide and protect them. Hermes met them at a spring, reassured Priam, and revealed that Hector's body was preserved by the gods. Priam offered Hermes a goblet, which Hermes refused. Hermes then took the reins, put the Greek guards to sleep, and led the chariot and wagon through the camp to Achilles' tent. Hermes revealed his divine identity to Priam and told him to enter fearlessly and appeal to Achilles.

Priam entered Achilles' tent, found Achilles at supper, and cast himself at Achilles' feet, embracing his hands, which had killed his sons. Achilles and his attendants were stunned. Priam appealed to Achilles' pity by reminding him of his own aged father, Peleus, and his own immense suffering. Achilles was moved to tears, weeping for his father and Patroclus, and Priam for Hector.

Achilles, composed, raised Priam and spoke gently, reminding him that man is born to bear sorrow and that Jove distributes good and evil. Priam insisted on seeing Hector's body. Achilles, with a flash of anger, told Priam not to provoke him, stating he would return Hector's body by Jove's command. He ordered his handmaids to wash and anoint Hector's body out of Priam's sight. Achilles then lifted Hector's body onto the funeral bed in the wagon, addressing Patroclus's shade and asking forgiveness.

Achilles invited Priam to eat, telling him the story of Niobe to encourage him. Priam and Achilles ate together, marveling at each other. Priam asked to sleep. Achilles prepared a bed for him outside the inner tent and asked how long he needed for Hector's funeral rites. Priam requested twelve days for mourning and burial, which Achilles granted as a truce.

Hermes, concerned for Priam's safety, woke him and urged him to leave before the Greeks discovered him. Priam and Idæus departed with the body and gifts. Hermes guided them past the guards and returned to Olympus. At dawn, Cassandra saw Priam's wagon approaching Troy with Hector's body and alerted the city. The Trojans rushed out, lamenting. Priam ordered them to take the body to the palace.

Hector's body was placed on a bed of state. Andromache, Hecuba, and Helen each lamented over him. Andromache foresaw Troy's fall and Astyanax's suffering. Hecuba praised Hector as heaven's favorite. Helen mourned Hector as her only kind friend in Troy. Priam ordered the Trojans to gather wood for the pyre. For nine days, they gathered wood. On the tenth day, Hector's body was placed on the pyre and burned. On the eleventh day, the Trojans quenched the flames, collected Hector's bones in a golden vase, and buried them in a mound, raising a tomb. Guards watched during the burial. The Trojans then returned to Priam's court for a funeral feast. The book concludes with the peaceful rest of Hector's shade."
The Scarlet Letter-Nathaniel Hawthorne,"The narrative begins with a detailed description of the Custom-House in Salem, Massachusetts, where the unnamed narrator works as a Surveyor. He describes the dilapidated wharf, the federal eagle above the Custom-House entrance, and the general lack of commercial activity. He introduces his elderly, mostly inactive colleagues, particularly the ""father of the Custom-House,"" a permanent Inspector who is eighty years old, robust, and focused solely on physical pleasures, devoid of deep thought or feeling. The narrator also sketches the Collector, a brave old General, whose military past contrasts with his current infirmity and quiet contemplation.

The narrator reflects on his own family's long history in Salem, including a stern Puritan ancestor who was a soldier, legislator, judge, and persecutor of Quakers and witches. He feels a strong, almost fated, attachment to the town despite its uninspiring nature. He describes his own intellectual stagnation and the loss of his imaginative faculty while working at the Custom-House, feeling that his literary talent has dwindled.

One rainy day, while sifting through old documents in an unfinished room in the Custom-House, the narrator discovers a small package wrapped in yellow parchment. Inside, he finds a commission for a former Surveyor named Jonathan Pue, and a small roll of dingy paper. Enveloped by these papers is a piece of fine, worn red cloth, intricately embroidered with gold thread, in the shape of the capital letter ""A."" Upon placing this scarlet letter on his own breast, the narrator experiences a sensation of burning heat and involuntarily drops it.

He then reads the accompanying manuscript, written by Surveyor Pue, which provides a ""reasonably complete explanation of the whole affair."" This manuscript details the life and experiences of one Hester Prynne, a ""noteworthy personage"" from the early days of Massachusetts, between the early settlement and the late seventeenth century. The narrator states that the main facts of the story he is about to tell are authenticated by this document, though he admits to taking liberties with motives and passions. He feels as if the ghost of Surveyor Pue has exhorted him to bring this story to the public, promising profit and warning him of his own impending removal from office.

Indeed, the narrator's political party loses power, and he is ""swept out of office"" by the ""besom of reform."" He views this as a fortunate turn of events, as his intellectual faculties were stifled by his Custom-House work. He then dedicates himself to writing, using the materials from Surveyor Pue's manuscript. He describes the resulting tale, ""The Scarlet Letter,"" as stern and somber, reflecting the period of turmoil in which it was conceived. He concludes the Custom-House introduction by noting that Roger Chillingworth, the old Inspector, has since died, and that Hester Prynne's story has become a legend, with her and Pearl disappearing for many years before Hester's eventual return.

The story proper, ""The Scarlet Letter,"" then begins:

**I. The Prison-Door.**
A crowd of stern-faced Puritan men and women gathers outside a gloomy, weather-stained wooden prison in Boston, in June, two centuries ago. The prison door is heavily timbered and studded with iron spikes. Beside the door, a wild rose-bush blooms, offering a symbol of fragile beauty and pity amidst the harshness.

**II. The Market-Place.**
The crowd, including many outspoken women, awaits a public punishment. They discuss the severity of the law and the specific case of Hester Prynne. Some suggest a brand on her forehead, while others, more merciful, note her pastor, Reverend Master Dimmesdale, takes her scandal to heart. The jailer, Master Brackett, opens the door, and Hester Prynne emerges, carrying a three-month-old baby. She is a tall, elegant woman with dark, abundant hair and striking beauty. On her breast, elaborately embroidered with gold thread on fine red cloth, is the letter ""A."" This scarlet letter, intended as a mark of shame, is so artistically crafted that it appears as a decoration. Hester, with a burning blush but a haughty smile, surveys the crowd. She is led to a scaffold in the market-place, a platform for public shame, but is spared the head-confining pillory. Standing on the scaffold, Hester endures the public gaze, her mind replaying memories of her past life in Old England, her parents, and a pale, deformed, scholar-like man—her husband—before returning to the harsh reality of her present ignominy.

**III. The Recognition.**
As Hester stands on the scaffold, she notices a deformed white man in the crowd, accompanied by an Indian. His features show remarkable intelligence, and he has one shoulder higher than the other. Upon seeing him, Hester clutches her baby convulsively. The stranger, in turn, fixes his gaze on Hester, a look of horror twisting his features before he controls it. He makes a gesture of silence to Hester and then asks a townsman about her. The townsman explains that Hester Prynne is a married woman whose husband, Master Prynne, a learned man from Amsterdam, was supposed to join her in Boston but has been missing for two years. Hester, left to her ""misguidance,"" has given birth to a child, but refuses to name the father. The stranger, who identifies himself as a wanderer recently redeemed from Indian captivity, remarks on the ""wise sentence"" that dooms Hester to wear the scarlet letter for life, but expresses a desire for the ""partner of her iniquity"" to be known. He then bows and departs with the Indian. Hester, though dreading a face-to-face encounter, feels a strange shelter in the presence of the multitude. Governor Bellingham, Mr. Wilson, and Mr. Dimmesdale are present in a balcony. Mr. Wilson urges Mr. Dimmesdale, Hester's pastor, to compel her to confess the father's name. Dimmesdale, pale and tremulous, appeals to Hester to reveal the name for her soul's peace and his own. Hester firmly refuses, stating the letter is too deeply branded and her child must seek a heavenly father. Another voice from the crowd demands she ""give her child a father,"" but Hester remains silent. Dimmesdale, with a long respiration, acknowledges her ""wondrous strength and generosity."" Mr. Wilson then preaches a long sermon on sin, while Hester endures with stony insensibility. She is then led back to prison, her scarlet letter reportedly casting a lurid gleam in the dark passage.

**IV. The Interview.**
In prison, Hester is in a state of nervous excitement, and the jailer introduces a physician, Roger Chillingworth, the same deformed man from the market-place. Chillingworth, who has learned medicinal properties from the ""savage people,"" calms Pearl with a draught. He then offers Hester a calming medicine, which she initially fears is poison. He reassures her it is for good, saying, ""Live, therefore, and bear about thy doom with thee, in the eyes of men and women,—in the eyes of him whom thou didst call thy husband,—in the eyes of yonder child!"" He then reveals himself as her long-lost husband, Master Prynne, who has taken the name Chillingworth. He acknowledges his folly in marrying her, an old, misshapen scholar, to her youth and beauty. Hester admits she felt no love for him. Chillingworth declares he seeks no vengeance on her, as they have wronged each other, but vows to find Pearl's father. He states that he will read the sin on the man's heart and torment him, but will not betray him to human law or harm his life or fame. He extracts a solemn oath from Hester that she will never reveal his true identity. Hester, troubled, asks if he is the ""Black Man"" who haunts the forest, but he denies it, saying his vengeance is not for her soul.

**V. Hester at Her Needle.**
Hester is released from prison. Despite being free to leave the Puritan settlement, she chooses to remain, feeling an irresistible compulsion to stay where her sin and ignominy are rooted. She establishes herself in a small, isolated thatched cottage on the outskirts of town. She supports herself and Pearl through her exquisite needlework, which becomes highly sought after for public ceremonies, official garments, and even funeral attire, though never for a bride's veil. Hester dresses herself in coarse, somber clothes, with only the scarlet letter as an ornament, but she adorns Pearl in rich, fanciful, gold-embroidered garments, which seem to embody the scarlet letter itself. Hester gives her surplus earnings to charity but receives only scorn. She endures social isolation, feeling like a ghost. Children mock her, and strangers stare at the scarlet letter, branding it afresh into her soul. Sometimes, she feels a sympathetic eye on her letter, only to realize it's a shared sin. She begins to believe the scarlet letter gives her a ""sympathetic knowledge of the hidden sin in other hearts,"" making her question the outward purity of others.

**VI. Pearl.**
Pearl is described as a beautiful, vigorous, and intelligent child, but with a wild, defiant nature that reflects Hester's own impassioned state during her birth. Hester struggles to discipline Pearl, who seems to be swayed only by her own impulses and often appears more like an ""airy sprite"" than a human child. Pearl is an outcast among other children, who scorn her, and she retaliates fiercely. At home, she creates imaginary worlds and enemies. Hester is tormented by Pearl's wildness and her constant fascination with the scarlet letter. Pearl's first conscious observation was the scarlet letter on Hester's bosom, and she often touches it or arranges burrs on it. Pearl repeatedly asks Hester about the meaning of the scarlet letter and why the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale always keeps his hand over his heart. Hester, unable to answer truthfully, tells Pearl she wears it for the gold thread, and becomes exasperated by Pearl's persistent questioning.

**VII. The Governor’s Hall.**
Hester goes to Governor Bellingham's mansion to deliver embroidered gloves and, more importantly, to plead against a plan by some leading inhabitants to take Pearl from her, believing Pearl is a ""demon offspring"" or would be better raised by others. Pearl, dressed in a crimson velvet tunic embroidered with gold, is a ""brightest little jet of flame."" As they approach the mansion, Puritan children mock them, but Pearl frightens them off. Inside the Governor's hall, Pearl is fascinated by a suit of burnished armor, in which Hester sees her own reflection distorted, with the scarlet letter appearing in ""exaggerated and gigantic proportions,"" seeming to hide her entirely. Pearl then demands a red rose from the garden.

**VIII. The Elf-Child and the Minister.**
Governor Bellingham enters with Mr. Wilson, Mr. Dimmesdale, and Roger Chillingworth. The Governor questions Hester's fitness as a mother, citing Pearl's elaborate attire and her inability to answer Mr. Wilson's catechism question about who made her (Pearl claims she was plucked from a rose bush by the prison door). Hester vehemently defends her right to keep Pearl, arguing that Pearl is her happiness and her torture, a constant reminder and punishment for her sin. She appeals to Mr. Dimmesdale, reminding him of his pastoral charge over her soul. Dimmesdale, looking pale and emaciated, supports Hester, arguing that God gave Pearl to Hester as both a blessing and a retribution, to keep her mother's soul alive and prevent her from deeper sin. Chillingworth smiles at Dimmesdale's earnestness. The magistrates decide to let Hester keep Pearl, but require Pearl to be catechized. Pearl, in a rare moment of tenderness, takes Dimmesdale's hand and kisses his brow. Mistress Hibbins, the Governor's sister (later executed as a witch), then appears and invites Hester to join her in the forest to meet the ""Black Man."" Hester refuses, saying Pearl saved her from Satan's snare. Chillingworth remarks on Pearl's wildness and wonders if a philosopher could guess the father from her nature.

**IX. The Leech.**
Roger Chillingworth, Hester's secret husband, settles in Boston as a physician, using his knowledge of European medicine and Indian herbs. He becomes Mr. Dimmesdale's medical adviser, as the young minister's health is failing due to intense study, pastoral duties, and self-imposed fasts and vigils. The community is divided: some believe Dimmesdale is too holy for this world, others that his decline is due to unworthiness. A rumor spreads that Chillingworth, with his mysterious past and increasingly evil appearance, is Satan's emissary, tormenting Dimmesdale. Chillingworth, who was once a kind and upright man, is now consumed by a ""terrible fascination"" for revenge, delving into Dimmesdale's heart like a miner for gold.

**X. The Leech and His Patient.**
Chillingworth relentlessly probes Dimmesdale's soul, seeking the hidden sin he suspects. Dimmesdale, with his sensitive nerves, vaguely perceives an inimical influence but, being suspicious of all mankind, cannot recognize his enemy in his trusted physician. One day, while discussing herbs gathered from a nameless grave, Chillingworth suggests the weeds symbolize a hideous secret buried with the dead man, which he should have confessed. Dimmesdale argues that some secrets are meant to be held until Judgment Day, and that public confession is not always part of divine retribution. Chillingworth presses him, asking why guilty ones don't seek solace by revealing their sins. Dimmesdale, clutching his heart, admits that many confess to him, finding relief, but that some men bury their secrets to preserve their reputation and continue doing good. Chillingworth dismisses this, saying such men deceive themselves and that a ""false show"" cannot be better than God's truth. Pearl and Hester pass by the window. Pearl, in a mischievous mood, dances on a tombstone and arranges burrs on Hester's scarlet letter. Chillingworth remarks on Pearl's lawless nature. Pearl throws a burr at Dimmesdale, who shrinks from it, and Pearl laughs, shouting that the ""old Black Man"" has already caught the minister. Dimmesdale, agitated, asks Chillingworth if he has profited from his care. Chillingworth implies that Dimmesdale's bodily illness stems from a ""sore place"" in his spirit, which he must reveal to be healed. Dimmesdale passionately refuses to confess to an ""earthly physician,"" committing himself to God. He rushes out. Chillingworth, with a grave smile, notes that Dimmesdale's passion reveals his ""wild thing erenow."" Later, Dimmesdale apologizes, and their intimacy is re-established. Some time after, Dimmesdale falls asleep in his chair. Chillingworth approaches him, lays his hand on his bosom, and thrusts aside his vestment, revealing something on Dimmesdale's chest. Chillingworth then turns away with a ""wild look of wonder, joy, and horror,"" an ""ecstasy"" that reveals his diabolical triumph.

**XI. The Interior of a Heart.**
After Chillingworth's discovery, his torment of Dimmesdale becomes more intimate and subtle. He plays upon Dimmesdale's fears and remorse, raising ""a thousand phantoms"" of shame. Dimmesdale, though dimly aware of an evil influence, cannot discern its true nature. He loathes Chillingworth's deformed figure but attributes his feelings to his own morbid state. Despite his internal suffering, Dimmesdale achieves brilliant popularity as a minister, his anguish fueling his eloquence. He is revered as a saint, but this public veneration tortures him, as he longs to confess his pollution and lie. He repeatedly attempts to confess his vileness from the pulpit, but his vague words are misinterpreted by the congregation as evidence of his profound holiness. In secret, Dimmesdale practices self-scourging, fasting, and vigils, during which he experiences visions of devils, angels, his dead parents, and Hester and Pearl pointing at his breast. He realizes the ""unspeakable misery of a life so false as his."" One night, a new thought strikes him, and he steals out of his house.

**XII. The Minister’s Vigil.**
Dimmesdale goes to the scaffold where Hester was publicly shamed seven years prior. In the darkness of an early May night, he stands there, tormented by remorse and cowardice. He lets out a shriek, which startles Governor Bellingham and Mistress Hibbins, who look out their windows. Mr. Wilson passes by, but does not see Dimmesdale. Hester and Pearl, returning from Governor Winthrop's deathbed, also come upon the scaffold. Dimmesdale calls them up, and the three stand together, forming an ""electric chain."" Pearl asks if he will stand with them at noontide tomorrow, but Dimmesdale refuses, promising to do so only at the ""great judgment day."" A meteor then illuminates the sky, forming a dull red letter ""A."" Dimmesdale interprets it as a sign of his guilt, but Pearl points to Chillingworth, who is watching nearby. Dimmesdale, terrified, asks Hester who Chillingworth is, but she remains silent, bound by her oath. Pearl whispers something unintelligible to Dimmesdale about the ""Black Man."" Chillingworth approaches, feigning concern, and leads Dimmesdale home. The next day, Dimmesdale preaches his most powerful sermon, but the sexton finds Dimmesdale's glove on the scaffold and mentions the meteor, interpreting the ""A"" as ""Angel"" for the deceased Governor Winthrop.

**XIII. Another View of Hester.**
Seven years have passed, and Pearl is now seven years old. Hester's public image has softened. Her constant helpfulness and charity during times of calamity have led many to reinterpret the scarlet letter, now saying it means ""Able."" She has become a ""Sister of Mercy."" However, her character has become more austere, her beauty diminished, and her heart has turned from passion to thought. She engages in bold speculation about society and the role of women, thoughts considered heretical by the Puritans. She realizes that Pearl, by her very existence, has kept her from becoming a prophetess or a radical. Hester, observing Dimmesdale's suffering during his vigil, feels a renewed responsibility towards him. She realizes Chillingworth's torment is driving Dimmesdale to ruin and resolves to reveal Chillingworth's true identity to the minister.

**XIV. Hester and the Physician.**
Hester sends Pearl to play by the water and confronts Roger Chillingworth in the forest. Chillingworth informs her that the magistrates have considered removing her scarlet letter, but Hester calmly replies that it will fall away only when she is worthy. Hester observes Chillingworth's transformation; his former intellectual calm has been replaced by a fierce, guarded look and a ""glare of red light"" in his eyes, making him appear devilish. She accuses him of tormenting Dimmesdale, saying he has become a fiend. Chillingworth admits his transformation is due to his seven years of revenge, which he has ""wasted"" on the minister. He claims Dimmesdale would have died sooner without his aid. Hester retorts that it would have been better for Dimmesdale to die. Chillingworth, with a ""lurid fire"" in his heart, confesses that he has made Dimmesdale suffer more than any mortal, and that he has become a fiend for this purpose. Hester, appalled, asks if he has not tortured Dimmesdale enough. Chillingworth replies that Dimmesdale has only increased his debt. Hester then declares she must reveal Chillingworth's true character to Dimmesdale, accepting whatever consequences may follow. Chillingworth, with a mix of admiration and gloom, says it is their ""fate"" and that he cannot pardon. He then waves his hand and returns to gathering herbs.

**XV. Hester and Pearl.**
Hester reflects on her hatred for Chillingworth, realizing she now hates him more than she repents her sin. Pearl returns from playing, having made a green ""A"" from eel-grass on her own bosom. She again asks Hester what the scarlet letter means and why the minister keeps his hand over his heart. Hester, distressed, tells Pearl that the letter is for the ""sake of its gold-thread,"" a lie she has never told before. Pearl persists in her questions, making Hester realize the child might be seeking a deeper connection. Hester contemplates Pearl's precocity and the possibility of confiding in her. Pearl's persistent questioning about the minister's hand over his heart deeply troubles Hester.

**XVI. A Forest Walk.**
Hester seeks an opportunity to speak with Dimmesdale alone, away from Chillingworth's influence. She learns he will be returning from visiting Apostle Eliot. The next day, she takes Pearl to a secluded part of the forest. Pearl observes that the sunshine avoids Hester because of the scarlet letter. Pearl then tells Hester the local superstition about the ""Black Man"" who haunts the forest, making people sign his book with their blood and marking them on their bosoms. Pearl asks if the scarlet letter is the Black Man's mark on Hester, and if Hester meets him. Hester, after some hesitation, admits she once met the Black Man and that the scarlet letter is his mark. Pearl then spots Dimmesdale approaching, noting he has his hand over his heart, and asks if that is where the Black Man marked him.

**XVII. The Pastor and His Parishioner.**
Hester calls out to Dimmesdale, who is walking feebly and haggardly. They meet in the dim forest, like ghosts from another world. They sit together, discussing their shared misery. Dimmesdale confesses his despair, the torment of his public veneration, and his longing for someone to know his true sinful self. Hester reveals that Roger Chillingworth is her husband and that he has been tormenting Dimmesdale for seven years. Dimmesdale is initially furious with Hester, blaming her for his suffering, but she pleads for his forgiveness. He eventually forgives her, declaring Chillingworth's revenge a greater sin than their own. Hester urges Dimmesdale to leave Boston and escape Chillingworth's influence. She proposes they flee together to the Old World, where they can start a new life.

**XVIII. A Flood of Sunshine.**
Dimmesdale, filled with a mix of hope, joy, and fear, agrees to flee with Hester. He feels a sudden exhilaration, as if released from a dungeon. Hester, with a sense of triumph, unclasps the scarlet letter from her bosom and throws it away into the withered leaves near the brook. She also removes her cap, letting her rich, dark hair fall. Her beauty, youth, and radiant smile return, and the forest is suddenly flooded with sunshine, reflecting their newfound hope. Hester tells Dimmesdale he must know Pearl, who is not far off.

**XIX. The Child at the Brook-Side.**
Hester calls Pearl, who is playing by the brook. Pearl, seeing her mother without the scarlet letter and with her hair unbound, is hesitant and refuses to cross the brook. She fixes her gaze on Hester and Dimmesdale, and then points at Hester's breast, where the letter should be. Dimmesdale, feeling uneasy, notes that children often distrust him. Hester realizes Pearl misses the scarlet letter. She retrieves the letter from the leaves and fastens it back onto her bosom, and confines her hair under her cap. As she does so, her beauty and warmth fade, and the sunshine vanishes. Pearl then bounds across the brook, embraces Hester, and kisses the scarlet letter. Pearl still refuses to kiss Dimmesdale and washes his previous kiss off her forehead in the brook. She asks if he will walk hand-in-hand with them into town, but Hester says not now, but in the future. Pearl remains aloof from Dimmesdale.

**XX. The Minister in a Maze.**
Dimmesdale leaves Hester and Pearl, returning to town with an unaccustomed physical energy, but also a sense of profound internal change. He and Hester have planned to escape to Bristol on a ship in three days, after he delivers his Election Sermon. As he walks, he is assailed by strange, wicked impulses: to utter blasphemies to a deacon, to suggest arguments against the soul's immortality to an old woman, to teach wicked words to children, and to exchange jests with a drunken sailor. He encounters Mistress Hibbins, who hints at his secret forest meeting and his connection to the ""Black Man."" Dimmesdale realizes he has made a bargain with sin, and that its poison has spread through his moral system. He returns to his study, throws his unfinished Election Sermon into the fire, and writes a new, inspired sermon with intense fervor throughout the night.

**XXI. The New England Holiday.**
On Election Day, Hester and Pearl are in the market-place, which is thronged with townspeople, Indians, and mariners. Hester wears her coarse gray garment and the scarlet letter, appearing outwardly calm but inwardly preparing for her freedom. Pearl is exuberantly dressed. Pearl notices Dimmesdale will not greet them publicly. Hester tells her he will not greet them today, but will walk with them another time. Pearl expresses her confusion about the minister's public aloofness versus his private interactions in the forest. A shipmaster, who has spoken with Hester about passage to Bristol, tells her that Roger Chillingworth has also booked passage on the same ship, intending to accompany Dimmesdale. Hester is shocked, realizing Chillingworth has discovered their plan. She sees Chillingworth in the market-place, smiling a ""secret and fearful meaning"" at her.

**XXII. The Procession.**
The procession begins with music and a military escort, followed by magistrates and then Mr. Dimmesdale. He walks with an unaccustomed energy and strength, his hand no longer over his heart, but his face is abstracted. Hester watches him, feeling a sense of remoteness and doubt about their shared bond. Pearl asks if he is the same minister who kissed her by the brook. Mistress Hibbins approaches Hester, again hinting at Dimmesdale's secret connection to the ""Black Man"" and predicting his mark will be revealed. Dimmesdale delivers his Election Sermon from the meeting-house, his voice filled with passion, pathos, and a deep undertone of pain that Hester alone perceives. The sermon moves the entire community, who believe him to be a miracle of holiness. Pearl, meanwhile, plays in the market-place, interacting with Indians and mariners. The shipmaster attempts to kiss Pearl, but she eludes him. He then gives her a gold chain and tells her that Chillingworth has arranged to bring Dimmesdale aboard the ship. Hester's spirit almost sinks, realizing Chillingworth has thwarted their escape. The crowd, including those who have heard rumors of the scarlet letter, gathers around Hester, making her feel the shame of the letter more acutely than ever.

**XXIII. The Revelation of the Scarlet Letter.**
After his sermon, Dimmesdale appears feeble and pale. He rejects Mr. Wilson's support and, to the astonishment of the crowd, calls Hester and Pearl to the scaffold. Roger Chillingworth rushes forward, attempting to stop him, whispering, ""Madman, hold! what is your purpose?"" Dimmesdale, however, declares Chillingworth's power is broken and, with God's help, he will escape him. He extends his hand to Hester, asking her to support him. Leaning on Hester and holding Pearl's hand, Dimmesdale ascends the scaffold. Chillingworth follows, remarking that this scaffold was the only place Dimmesdale could not escape him. Dimmesdale, trembling, asks Hester if this is not ""better than what we dreamed of in the forest."" Hester replies she doesn't know, fearing they will all die. Dimmesdale then addresses the people, confessing his sin and revealing that he is the ""one sinner of the world."" With a convulsive motion, he tears away his ministerial band, revealing a scarlet letter (or similar mark) imprinted on his own breast. The horror-stricken multitude gazes at this ""ghastly miracle."" Dimmesdale falls, and Hester supports his head. Chillingworth kneels beside him, repeating, ""Thou hast escaped me!"" Dimmesdale, dying, forgives Chillingworth, saying he too has deeply sinned. He asks Pearl for a kiss, which she gives him, breaking a ""spell"" and signifying her entry into human sympathy. Hester asks if they will meet in eternal life, but Dimmesdale expresses doubt, saying their broken law and revealed sin may prevent a ""pure reunion."" With a final ""Farewell!"" Dimmesdale expires.

**XXIV. Conclusion.**
After Dimmesdale's death, various theories circulate regarding the mark on his breast: some believe he inflicted it himself as penance, others that Chillingworth used magic and poison, and still others that it was the physical manifestation of his remorse. Some witnesses deny any mark existed, interpreting his death as a parable about human righteousness. The narrator, however, states his manuscript source confirms the mark. Roger Chillingworth, deprived of his object of revenge, withers away and dies within a year, leaving a substantial inheritance to Pearl. Pearl, now a rich heiress, disappears from Boston with Hester. For many years, there are no authentic tidings of them. Eventually, Hester Prynne returns alone to her old cottage, still wearing the scarlet letter. The letter has lost its stigma and become a symbol of reverence. Hester, having no selfish ends, becomes a counselor to troubled women, offering comfort and believing in a future ""new truth"" that will establish a surer relation between man and woman. She is buried next to Dimmesdale, but with a space between their graves, sharing a single tombstone inscribed: ""On a field, sable, the letter A, gules."""
Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea-Jules Verne,"The year 1866 was marked by a mysterious phenomenon: an enormous, spindle-shaped, occasionally phosphorescent object, much larger and faster than any known whale, was sighted by vessels across the globe. Initial reports from ships like the *Governor Higginson* and the *Columbus* in the Pacific, and later the *Helvetia* and *Shannon* in the Atlantic, described its surprising speed and power. These sightings, along with a collision involving the *Etna*, led to widespread public agitation and scientific debate. While some dismissed it as fable, others, including the narrator, Professor Pierre Aronnax of the Paris Museum of Natural History, theorized it was a gigantic marine animal, possibly a colossal narwhal with a steel-like horn, capable of piercing ship hulls, as evidenced by the two-yard hole found in the *Scotia* after it was struck.

In early 1867, the phenomenon escalated from a scientific problem to a real danger, with the object now perceived as a ""shifting reef"" that caused further accidents, such as the *Moravian* striking an uncharted rock. Public demand for action led the United States government to launch an expedition to hunt this ""sea-unicorn."" Professor Aronnax, then in New York, received an invitation from the Secretary of Marine, J.B. Hobson, to join the frigate *Abraham Lincoln* and represent France. Despite his weariness from a previous expedition, Aronnax accepted, driven by a sense of scientific duty and the allure of the unknown.

Aronnax's devoted Flemish servant, Conseil, agreed to accompany him. On board the *Abraham Lincoln*, they met Commander Farragut, a determined seaman convinced of the monster's existence. The frigate was heavily armed, and among its crew was Ned Land, a renowned Canadian harpooner. Ned, however, was skeptical, believing no cetacean could damage an iron ship. Aronnax attempted to convince him by explaining the immense pressure at ocean depths and the incredible strength an animal would need to withstand it, suggesting it would be ""made of iron plates eight inches thick.""

The *Abraham Lincoln* departed from Brooklyn, heading for the North Pacific where the monster was last sighted. After three weeks, off the coast of Patagonia, Ned Land still expressed doubt. The voyage was largely uneventful, though Ned Land demonstrated his skill by harpooning two whales during a brief stop. The frigate doubled Cape Horn and entered the Pacific. For three months, the crew maintained a vigilant watch, but only sighted common whales, leading to growing frustration. Commander Farragut, facing discontent, promised to abandon the search in three days if the monster didn't appear, turning the ship towards European seas.

On November 5, 1867, as the deadline approached, Ned Land suddenly cried out, ""Look out there! The very thing we are looking for—on our weather beam!"" A luminous object, emitting an intense electric light, appeared two cables' length from the frigate. It moved with astonishing speed, encircling the *Abraham Lincoln* before rushing back. Commander Farragut, realizing it was an ""electric narwhal,"" decided to wait for daylight to attack. The next morning, after a thick fog lifted, the monster was spotted again. The frigate pursued it at full steam, but the creature matched its speed, even circling the ship. A cannon shot hit the object but slid off, confirming its hard, impenetrable nature. That night, the *Abraham Lincoln* cautiously approached the seemingly motionless, luminous object. Ned Land threw his harpoon, striking a hard body. The light vanished, two waterspouts erupted over the frigate, and a fearful shock threw Aronnax into the sea.

Aronnax, struggling in the dark, was saved by Conseil, who had followed him into the water. Conseil reported that the frigate's screw and rudder were broken. Just as Aronnax was losing consciousness, Ned Land appeared, having also been thrown overboard. Ned revealed that his harpoon had been blunted because the ""beast is made of sheet iron."" Aronnax realized the ""monster"" was a human-made submarine boat. They clung to its back as it began to move. Eight masked men emerged from a panel and forcibly abducted them into the submarine.

Inside, Aronnax, Ned, and Conseil were confined to a cabin. The submarine's commander, Captain Nemo, revealed he understood French, English, German, and Latin, and had deliberately withheld communication to observe them. He identified them and explained that their presence, due to the *Abraham Lincoln*'s pursuit of his vessel, had ""troubled"" his existence. Nemo declared he was ""not what you call a civilised man,"" having broken all ties with humanity, and now lived independently beneath the sea. He offered them ""freedom"" on board the *Nautilus* (the name of his vessel, marked with an ""N"" and the motto ""MOBILIS IN MOBILI""), on the condition of passive obedience and never leaving the vessel or revealing its secrets. Ned Land vehemently refused to give his word of honor, but Aronnax, intrigued by the scientific possibilities, accepted. Nemo stated they would never see their country or friends again, as he kept them to protect his secret. He promised Aronnax a journey through a ""land of marvels.""

Aronnax was given an elegant cabin. Nemo showed him the *Nautilus*'s luxurious interior, including a vast library (12,000 volumes) and a museum filled with natural and artistic treasures, all collected by Nemo from the sea. Nemo explained that electricity, generated from sodium extracted from seawater, powered everything on board: light, heat, motion, and even the air pumps that allowed them to stay submerged for extended periods. He detailed the *Nautilus*'s construction: a double-hulled, cigar-shaped cylinder, 232 feet long, built in secret from parts manufactured globally and assembled on a desert island. It weighed 1500 tons, could achieve 50 miles per hour, and could dive to immense depths using inclined planes and water-filled reservoirs. Nemo revealed his immense wealth, derived from sunken treasures.

The *Nautilus* began its journey across the Pacific, following the Kuro-Scivo current. Aronnax, Ned, and Conseil were often allowed to observe the submarine world through the saloon's glass panels, witnessing vibrant marine life attracted by the electric light. On November 16, Nemo invited them on a ""hunting party"" in the ""submarine forests of the island of Crespo."" Equipped with special diving-dresses, air reservoirs (Rouquayrol apparatus), and electric lamps (Ruhmkorff apparatus), they walked on the seabed. Aronnax was amazed by the underwater flora and fauna, including a monstrous sea-spider. They descended to 75 fathoms, where Nemo pointed out the ""prop of the Island of Crespo,"" a wall of granite. During their return, they narrowly escaped two formidable sharks.

The *Nautilus* continued its journey, encountering a recent shipwreck, the *Florida, Sunderland*, with corpses still on its deck. They passed coral islands and the New Hebrides. On December 27, Nemo announced they were at Vanikoro, the site of La Perouse's lost expedition. Nemo, revealing his knowledge of the wreck, showed Aronnax a tin box containing La Perouse's instructions, annotated by Louis XVI. He stated that La Perouse's crew perished on the Solomon Islands after building a smaller boat, and that a ""coral tomb makes a quiet grave.""

Entering the Torres Straits, the *Nautilus* navigated through dangerous reefs. On January 4, 1868, it ran aground near Gilboa Island. Nemo, confident in the upcoming full moon's high tide, granted Aronnax, Ned, and Conseil permission to go ashore. Ned Land was overjoyed at the prospect of fresh meat. They hunted successfully, finding bread-fruit, pigeons, a hog, and kangaroos. Ned, eager for permanent escape, even suggested never returning to the *Nautilus*. Their dinner was interrupted by stones thrown by Papuan natives.

They retreated to the *Nautilus*, which remained deserted on the surface. Aronnax found Nemo playing his organ, unconcerned by the savages. Nemo stated the *Nautilus* had nothing to fear. Aronnax expressed concern about the natives boarding when the hatches opened for air renewal. Nemo calmly replied, ""Let them come. I see no reason for hindering them."" He explained that he did not wish to harm the ""poor creatures."" The next day, as the tide rose, the *Nautilus* was still surrounded by hundreds of Papuans. When the hatches were opened, the first natives to touch the stair-rail were repelled by an invisible electric force. Ned Land, in his excitement, also touched the rail and was thrown back, realizing it was a charged metallic cable. The *Nautilus* then floated free and sailed safely out of the Straits.

The *Nautilus* sped through the Indian Ocean, where Aronnax observed phosphorescent ""milk seas"" caused by infusoria. On February 28, they reached Ceylon. Nemo invited them to visit the pearl-fisheries in the Gulf of Manaar, warning them about sharks. Ned Land, despite his bravado, was apprehensive about fighting sharks in the water. During the dive, they saw a gigantic tridacne oyster containing a pearl the size of a coconut, which Nemo left to grow. They then witnessed an Indian pearl fisherman being attacked by a huge shark. Captain Nemo, armed with a dagger, fought the shark, burying his weapon in its side. Ned Land, rushing to Nemo's aid, harpooned the monster, saving Nemo. Nemo revived the Indian and gave him a bag of pearls. Nemo then revealed that the Indian was from an ""oppressed country,"" and he, Nemo, was one of them.

The *Nautilus* passed through the Maldives and Laccadives, then entered the Red Sea. Nemo revealed a secret ""Arabian Tunnel"" beneath the Isthmus of Suez, which he had discovered and used to connect the Red Sea and Mediterranean. They passed through this subterranean passage, carried by a powerful current. In the Mediterranean, Ned Land again proposed escape, but Aronnax hesitated, still engrossed in his studies. They passed near Santorin, where Nemo showed Aronnax a submarine volcanic eruption, a boiling, sulphurous sea.

After crossing the Mediterranean in 48 hours, the *Nautilus* entered the Atlantic. Ned Land, desperate, announced his plan to escape that night, as they would be near the Spanish coast. Aronnax, conflicted, agreed to wait for Ned's signal. That evening, Nemo unexpectedly appeared and began recounting the Battle of Vigo Bay in 1702, where Spanish galleons laden with treasure were scuttled. Nemo then revealed they were in Vigo Bay, and his crew was collecting the gold and silver from the wrecks. He hinted that he used these riches to aid ""suffering beings and oppressed races.""

The *Nautilus* then headed south-south-west, away from Europe, dashing Ned's hopes. Nemo took Aronnax on a nocturnal excursion to a submerged continent, Atlantis, where a submarine volcano erupted lava. Aronnax witnessed the ruins of an ancient city, a ""perfect Pompeii,"" engulfed by cataclysms. Nemo wrote ""ATLANTIS"" on a basalt rock, confirming Aronnax's discovery.

Next, they visited a submarine coal-mine within an extinct volcano, Nemo's ""harbour of refuge,"" where his crew extracted coal to generate electricity. They continued their journey, passing through the Sargasso Sea, a vast floating meadow of seaweed. The *Nautilus* then descended to an unprecedented depth of 16,000 yards (four leagues) in the Atlantic, where Nemo took a photographic view of the abyssal plain.

Continuing south, the *Nautilus* encountered a troop of whales being attacked by cachalots. Nemo, condemning the whalers' destructive practices, used the *Nautilus* as a weapon, ramming and killing many cachalots to protect the whales. He then collected milk from a dead whale for food. Ned Land's resentment towards Nemo grew.

The *Nautilus* pressed on towards the South Pole, navigating through immense icebergs. On March 18, it became completely blocked by an ""interminable and immovable barrier"" of ice. Nemo, undeterred, announced his intention to reach the pole by going *under* the ice. They descended to 400 fathoms, floating beneath the iceberg. After hours of slow progress and repeated collisions with the ice ceiling, the *Nautilus* was trapped. Nemo calmly explained they faced death by crushing or suffocation, as their air supply would last only two more days. He ordered his men to cut a trench in the ice, but the water began to solidify around them. Nemo then devised a desperate plan: to inject boiling water to prevent further freezing. This bought them time. On the sixth day of imprisonment, with air nearly exhausted, Nemo lightened the vessel, then filled its reservoirs, causing it to sink and crush the remaining ice. The *Nautilus* shot downwards like a bullet, then ascended rapidly, breaking through the last ice plate, and pure air flooded the vessel.

Aronnax, Ned, and Conseil, near death from suffocation, were revived by the fresh air. The *Nautilus* sped north, rounding Cape Horn and following the American coast. They observed various marine life, including manatees near the Amazon River mouth. Ned Land's desire for escape intensified, especially as they approached Nova Scotia and the St. Lawrence River, his homeland. Aronnax confronted Nemo, asking if they would be held prisoner forever. Nemo reiterated his rule: ""Whoever enters the *Nautilus*, must never quit it,"" and refused further discussion.

A violent hurricane struck the *Nautilus* off Long Island, near New York. Nemo, in an ""unaccountable caprice,"" chose to brave the storm on the surface, demonstrating the vessel's invulnerability. Later, in the Atlantic, they found the electric cable. On June 1, the *Nautilus* located the wreck of a French warship, *The Avenger*, which had sunk 74 years prior, preferring death to surrender. Nemo, revealing his deep hatred for an ""accursed nation"" that had caused him to lose ""country, wife, children, father, and mother,"" declared he would sink an approaching man-of-war.

Ned Land attempted to signal the warship, but Nemo violently stopped him, unfurling a black flag. Nemo ordered Aronnax and his companions below, stating he would sink the ship and would not have its ruins mingle with those of *The Avenger*. Aronnax, Ned, and Conseil were trapped in the saloon as the *Nautilus* dove. It rammed the warship below the waterline, passing through it ""like a needle through sailcloth."" Aronnax watched in horror as the vessel sank, its crew struggling and screaming, before an explosion blew up its decks, sending it and its victims into the abyss. Nemo, the ""terrible avenger,"" then went to his room, where Aronnax saw him kneel before a portrait of a woman and two children, bursting into sobs.

The *Nautilus* sped northward at a frightful pace, leaving the scene of destruction. Aronnax was filled with horror for Nemo. Time became distorted, clocks stopped. Ned Land, at his breaking point, announced they would escape that night, having sighted land 20 miles east. Aronnax agreed, preparing his notes. At 10 PM, Aronnax crept through the dark *Nautilus* to the saloon, where he found Nemo absorbed in playing his organ, murmuring, ""Almighty God! enough! enough!"" Aronnax rushed past, joined Ned and Conseil in the boat, and Ned began to unfasten it. Suddenly, loud voices cried, ""The maelstrom! the maelstrom!"" They realized they were on the coast of Norway, being drawn into the irresistible whirlpool. The *Nautilus* was caught in a spiral, and their small boat, still attached, was hurled into the maelstrom as the bolts gave way. Aronnax lost consciousness.

Aronnax awoke in a fisherman's hut on the Loffoden Isles, with Ned Land and Conseil, safe and sound. He did not know how they escaped the maelstrom. He revised his account of the incredible 20,000-league voyage. He wondered about the fate of the *Nautilus* and Captain Nemo, hoping his vessel survived and that Nemo's hatred had been appeased, allowing the ""philosopher"" to continue his peaceful exploration of the sea. Aronnax concluded that only Captain Nemo and he had the right to answer the ancient question: ""That which is far off and exceeding deep, who can find it out?"""
Ulysses-James Joyce,"The plot of the provided text, ""Ulysses,"" unfolds over a single day, June 16, 1904, primarily through the experiences and internal monologues of two main characters, Stephen Dedalus and Leopold Bloom, and concludes with Molly Bloom's thoughts. The narrative is presented in three distinct chapters, each focusing on different characters and settings, with a constantly shifting style.

**Chapter 1: Telemachus**

The story begins at a Martello tower overlooking Dublin Bay. Buck Mulligan, a medical student, emerges from the stairhead, carrying a shaving bowl with a mirror and razor. He intones a Latin phrase and calls out to Stephen Dedalus, whom he nicknames ""Kinch."" Mulligan performs a mock blessing of the tower and the surrounding landscape, then makes rapid crosses at Stephen, who is displeased and sleepy.

Mulligan begins to shave, chatting gaily and calling his own name, Malachi Mulligan, absurd. He proposes a trip to Athens if his aunt provides money. Stephen, leaning on the staircase, asks how long Haines, an English tourist, is going to stay in the tower. Mulligan describes Haines as a ""ponderous Saxon"" who thinks Stephen is not a gentleman. Stephen reveals that Haines was ""raving all night about a black panther"" and that he was afraid. He declares he will leave if Haines stays.

Mulligan asks Stephen for his handkerchief (""noserag"") to wipe his razor, which Stephen reluctantly provides. Mulligan calls it ""the bard's noserag"" and ""snotgreen."" Gazing out at Dublin Bay, Mulligan calls the sea a ""great sweet mother."" He then tells Stephen that his aunt believes Stephen killed his mother because he refused to kneel and pray for her on her deathbed. Stephen gloomily replies, ""Someone killed her."" Stephen internally recalls his mother's death, her wasted body, and the smell of wax and rosewood, and his refusal of her last wish.

Mulligan offers Stephen some clothes, then mocks his secondhand trousers. He mentions that someone thinks Stephen has ""g. p. i."" (general paralysis of the insane). He shows Stephen a cracked mirror, which Stephen bitterly calls ""a symbol of Irish art."" Mulligan then links arms with Stephen, suggesting they work together to ""Hellenise"" the island, and mentions Haines's father made money from a ""swindle.""

Stephen confronts Mulligan, asking if he remembers saying, ""O, it’s only Dedalus whose mother is beastly dead"" after his mother's death. Mulligan is briefly flushed but dismisses the remark as insignificant, criticizing Stephen for sulking while refusing his dying mother's request to pray.

A voice from inside the tower calls Mulligan for breakfast, saying ""The Sassenach wants his morning rashers."" Mulligan descends, singing. Stephen remains, reflecting on his mother's death and his guilt. He recalls memories of her, her possessions, and a childhood song. He hears Mulligan's voice.

Stephen descends to the gloomy living room, where Mulligan is preparing breakfast. Haines apologizes for waking them last night. Mulligan tells Stephen that Haines found his ""symbol of Irish art"" clever and suggests Stephen ask Haines for money. Stephen says he gets paid that morning and offers Mulligan a loan. Mulligan is delighted, planning a ""glorious drunk.""

The milkwoman arrives. Mulligan asks Stephen to get the milk jug. Mulligan casually mentions ""the collector of prepuces"" to Haines. The old woman asks for payment. Stephen says ""A quart."" She pours the milk, and Stephen observes her, thinking of her as a ""wandering crone."" Stephen asks her if she understands Mulligan. She asks Haines if he is speaking French. Haines speaks Irish. Mulligan explains Haines is English but advocates for Irish language in Ireland. The old woman agrees.

The milkwoman gives her bill. Stephen pays her a florin, leaving twopence owed. She curtseys and leaves, as Mulligan sings after her. Mulligan again asks Stephen for money from his school pay. Haines mentions he will visit the national library. Mulligan suggests a swim and mocks Stephen for washing only once a month. Haines praises Stephen's ""cracked lookingglass"" remark.

Stephen explains his need for money. Mulligan returns Stephen's handkerchief and puts on his collar and tie, joking about needing ""puce gloves and green boots."" He gives Stephen a hat. Haines calls them. Mulligan tells Stephen he has eaten all the food. They leave the tower, and Stephen locks the heavy iron door with a huge key, which he puts in his pocket.

At the foot of the ladder, Mulligan asks for the key, which Stephen confirms he has. Mulligan playfully hits ferns with his bathtowel. Haines asks about the tower's rent. Stephen states it's ""Twelve quid"" to the ""secretary of state for war."" Haines comments on the tower being bleak in winter. Mulligan calls it the ""_omphalos_.""

Haines asks Stephen his idea of Hamlet. Mulligan jokingly interjects that Stephen proves ""Hamlet’s grandson is Shakespeare’s grandfather and that he himself is the ghost of his own father."" Stephen says he is tired and it's a long story. Mulligan says only ""the sacred pint"" can loosen Stephen's tongue. Haines compares the cliffs to Elsinore. Stephen sees his own image in mourning between their ""gay attires."" Haines mentions a theological interpretation of Hamlet as ""The Father and the Son idea.""

Mulligan sings a blasphemous song about ""Joseph the joiner."" He runs to the cliff, fluttering his hands, and sings ""Goodbye, now, goodbye!"" Haines comments on Mulligan's blasphemy but finds his gaiety disarming. Stephen calls it ""The ballad of joking Jesus.""

Haines asks Stephen if he is a believer. Stephen says there's only one sense of the word. Haines offers him a cigarette. Haines asks if Stephen believes in a personal God. Stephen calls himself ""a horrible example of free thought."" Stephen internally reflects on Haines wanting the key and his own sense of servitude. Haines says Stephen is his own master. Stephen replies he is a ""servant of two masters, an English and an Italian."" Haines asks for clarification. Stephen names ""The imperial British state"" and ""the holy Roman catholic and apostolic church."" Haines calmly says an Irishman must think like that and that England has treated Ireland unfairly.

Stephen internally connects Haines's subsequent remark about not wanting his country to fall into the hands of ""German jews"" to Mulligan's earlier mockery.

They pass two men discussing a drowned man, nine days ago. Stephen reflects on the ""swollen bundle."" They walk down to a creek. Mulligan sits to unlace his boots. A young man is already in the water. An elderly man scrambles out. Mulligan crosses himself. The young man says ""Seymour’s back in town"" and is joining the army. Mulligan says ""Ah, go to God!"" The young man mentions Seymour spooning with ""Lily"" on the pier. Mulligan asks if she's ""up the pole."" Mulligan takes off his trousers, saying ""Redheaded women buck like goats."" He fears his ""twelfth rib is gone."" He takes off his shirt.

Stephen announces he's leaving. Mulligan asks for the key to keep his ""chemise flat"" and twopence for a pint. Stephen gives him both. Mulligan plunges into the water, quoting Zarathustra. Haines smiles at Stephen, calling him ""wild Irish."" Mulligan calls out ""The Ship, Half twelve."" Stephen agrees and walks away, reflecting on not sleeping in the tower and not being able to go home. He hears a sweet-toned voice from the sea and waves. He thinks ""Usurper.""

**Chapter 2: Nestor**

Stephen Dedalus is teaching a history class. He asks a boy named Cochrane about Pyrrhus, who fought a battle at Tarentum. Cochrane forgets the location. Stephen prompts him with ""Asculum"" and the famous quote, ""Another victory like that and we are done for.""

Stephen then asks Armstrong about Pyrrhus's end. Armstrong, distracted by figrolls, gives a silly answer, ""Pyrrhus, a pier,"" which makes the other boys laugh. Stephen defines a pier as a ""disappointed bridge."" He reflects on history and his land. He thinks of writing a chapbook for Haines.

The boys ask for a story. Stephen opens a book and has Talbot recite verses from ""Lycidas."" Stephen's thoughts drift to Aristotle and the nature of thought.

Talbot finishes reading. Stephen asks a riddle: ""The cock crew, The sky was blue: The bells in heaven Were striking eleven. ’Tis time for this poor soul To go to heaven."" The boys are puzzled. Stephen reveals the answer: ""The fox burying his grandmother under a hollybush,"" and laughs nervously.

A stick strikes the door, and a voice calls ""Hockey!"" The boys rush out. Sargent, a boy with tangled hair and weak eyes, lingers and shows Stephen his copybook with ""Sums"" written on it. Mr. Deasy told him to rewrite them. Stephen asks if he understands, and Sargent says no. Stephen helps him solve the problem, internally reflecting on Sargent's mother's love and his own mother's death.

Stephen sends Sargent out to play. Mr. Deasy, the headmaster, with an angry white moustache, asks Stephen to wait in his study.

Mr. Deasy enters and settles Stephen's pay, giving him ""Three twelve"" (£3 12s). Stephen takes the money. Mr. Deasy advises him to save, stating ""Money is power."" Stephen murmurs ""Iago.""

Mr. Deasy asks about the pride of the English. Stephen says ""That on his empire... the sun never sets."" Mr. Deasy refutes this, attributing the quote to a French Celt. He states that the proudest boast of an Englishman is ""I paid my way."" Stephen reflects on his own debts.

Mr. Deasy, a ""tory,"" discusses O'Connell and the orange lodges. Stephen makes a brief gesture. Mr. Deasy claims ""rebel blood"" but is descended from a man who voted for the union.

Mr. Deasy asks Stephen to do him a favor by getting a letter published in the press. The letter is about the foot and mouth disease, which he believes England will use as an excuse to embargo Irish cattle. He asserts the disease can be cured and he is seeking publicity.

Mr. Deasy then states, ""England is in the hands of the jews. In all the highest places: her finance, her press."" He believes they are a sign of national decay and are ""wanderers on the earth to this day."" Stephen counters that a merchant is one who buys cheap and sells dear, ""jew or gentile.""

Stephen declares, ""History... is a nightmare from which I am trying to awake.""

Mr. Deasy states, ""The ways of the Creator are not our ways... All human history moves towards one great goal, the manifestation of God."" Stephen points to the window, where a shout is heard, and says, ""That is God."" Mr. Deasy then blames women for bringing sin into the world, citing Helen of Troy and Parnell's downfall. He asserts he will ""fight for the right till the end"" for Ulster.

Stephen says he will try to get the letter published in ""The Evening Telegraph."" Mr. Deasy thanks him.

As Stephen leaves, Mr. Deasy calls him back to impart one last piece of ""wisdom"": ""Ireland, they say, has the honour of being the only country which never persecuted the jews. Do you know that? No. And do you know why?"" Stephen asks why. Mr. Deasy replies, ""Because she never let them in."" He laughs, coughing. Stephen walks away, reflecting on being called ""the bullockbefriending bard"" by Mulligan.

---

**Chapter 3: Proteus**

Stephen Dedalus walks alone along Sandymount strand, reflecting on the ""ineluctable modality of the visible"" and ""audible."" He closes and opens his eyes, experiencing the sounds and sights of the beach. He hears the rhythm of a galloping mare.

He sees two women, one with a midwife's bag, on the shore. He reflects on his own birth, ""made not begotten,"" by his parents, and the ""ghostwoman with ashes on her breath"" (his mother). He thinks of theological concepts like consubstantiality.

He remembers he must deliver Mr. Deasy's letter. He considers going to his aunt Sara's house, recalling his ""consubstantial father's voice"" and family members. He imagines/recalls visiting his uncle Richie, who is in bed, asking for whisky and offering Stephen food. Stephen declines. Stephen reflects on his family's decay.

He recalls being told he would never be a saint, and praying to the Virgin Mary and the devil. He remembers crying ""Naked women!"" on the Howth tram. He thinks of his ""epiphanies"" written on green leaves.

He notices the sand is gone from under his feet. He passes broken hoops, nets, and crucified shirts. He realizes he has passed the way to his aunt's house and turns towards the Pigeonhouse. He recalls Kevin Egan, ""son of the wild goose,"" in Paris, drinking milk and talking about women and socialism. He thinks of his ""Latin quarter hat."" He remembers a telegram from his father: ""Mother dying come home father."" He recalls Mulligan's aunt thinking he killed his mother. He thinks of Egan's stories of ""lost leaders,"" and Egan's current ""Loveless, landless, wifeless"" state. He remembers teaching Patrice to sing ""The boys of Kilkenny.""

He feels his feet sinking in the sand and turns back towards the boulders. He reflects on the tower and not wanting to sleep there. He thinks ""Take all, keep all."" He sits on a rock and sees a ""bloated carcass of a dog."" He thinks of the man drowned nine days ago. He questions if he would save a drowning man, admitting he is not a strong swimmer and could not save his mother.

He sees a dog running, then two figures (a woman and a man), whom he calls ""the two maries"" (cocklepickers). The dog runs to them, then sniffs the dead dog's carcass. The man kicks the dog away. The dog urinates and buries something in the sand.

Stephen recalls a dream about a ""street of harlots"" and a man with a melon. He sees the cocklepickers, ""the red Egyptians,"" walking away. He reflects on ""Wombed in sin darkness"" and the ""winedark sea."" He thinks of a ""pale vampire"" and a ""mouth to her mouth’s kiss."" He scribbles words on a rock. He observes his shadow, thinking about its ending. He reflects on the ""ineluctable modality of the ineluctable visuality."" He recalls a virgin at Hodges Figgis' window and thinks of her as a ""lady of letters."" He feels lonely and desires touch.

He lies back on the rocks. He thinks of Kevin Egan's movement and ""Pan’s hour."" He broods on his boots and a girl he knew in Paris. He sees the tide coming in. He hears a ""fourworded wavespeech."" He thinks of ""Full fathom five thy father lies"" and the drowned man. He imagines the ""corpsegas sopping in foul brine."" He thinks of ""Seadeath, mildest of all deaths."" He thinks about his bad teeth and whether to go to a dentist with his money. He remembers Mulligan taking his handkerchief and realizes he didn't pick it up. He picks dry snot from his nostril and places it on a rock. He sees a three-master ship sailing silently.

**Chapter 4: Calypso**

Mr. Leopold Bloom is in his kitchen, preparing breakfast. He eats inner organs of beasts and fowls, especially mutton kidneys. He interacts with his cat, giving it milk, and reflects on the cat's nature.

He goes upstairs to the bedroom door. He tells his wife, Molly, he's going ""round the corner"" and asks if she wants anything for breakfast. She grunts a sleepy ""Mn."" He hears the bedstead jingle. He reflects on Molly's father, old Tweedy, and his stamp collection. He leaves the house quietly, realizing he forgot his latchkey.

He walks through Dublin streets, observing the sun and thinking about travel and the East. He passes Larry O'Rourke's pub, reflecting on how publicans get rich. He passes Saint Joseph's National school. He stops at Dlugacz's porkbutcher's window, staring at sausages. He buys a pork kidney. He observes a shopgirl with ""vigorous hips"" and ""sodachapped hands."" He reads a page from a pile of sheets about a model farm in Kinnereth, Palestine. He thinks about cattle markets. He pays for the kidney and watches the girl saunter away, reflecting on her appearance and imagining a constable cuddling her.

He walks back, reading about ""Agendath Netaim,"" a planters' company in Palestine. He thinks about olives, oranges, and old times with Molly, Citron, and Mastiansky. He reflects on the Dead Sea as ""the grey sunken cunt of the world."" He hurries home, feeling ""grey horror."" He sees two letters and a card on the hall floor, one for Molly from ""Boylan"" and one for him from ""Milly.""

He enters the bedroom. Molly asks who the letters are for. He tells her about Milly's letter and card, and her letter from Boylan. He raises the blind. Molly reads Boylan's letter and tucks it under her pillow. She asks for tea.

He scalds the teapot, puts in tea, and fries the kidney. He gives the cat the bloodsmeared paper. He reads Milly's letter: she thanks him for a birthday present, is doing well in photography, mentions a picnic, and a student named Bannon who sings Boylan's song about ""seaside girls."" He reflects on Milly's birthday, her growing up, and a past argument. He thinks about Molly's engagement with Boylan, who is bringing the program for her concert. Molly says she will sing ""_Là ci darem_"" and ""_Love’s Old Sweet Song_."" He asks if she wants the window open. She asks about the funeral.

Molly asks him to find a word in a book (""Ruby: the Pride of the Ring""). The word is ""Metempsychosis."" Bloom explains it means ""the transmigration of souls."" Molly says, ""O, rocks! Tell us in plain words."" He explains it as living in another body after death, reincarnation. He thinks of Dignam's soul. He mentions the ancient Greeks believed in changing into animals or trees. Molly notices a smell of burn.

Bloom realizes he burnt the kidney. He retrieves it, slightly burnt, and eats it. He rereads Milly's letter, reflecting on her independence and ripening. He thinks of Molly's ""sweet light lips"" and the ""flowing qualm"" of regret. The cat wants to go out. Bloom feels a ""gentle loosening of his bowels."" He goes to the jakes (outhouse), taking an old _Titbits_ magazine. He reads a story called ""Matcham's Masterstroke"" while defecating. He envies the writer, Mr. Philip Beaufoy. He thinks of Molly dressing and her ""full wagging bub."" He tears off half the story to wipe himself. He checks his trousers for dirt. The bells of George's church toll the hour. He thinks ""Poor Dignam!""

**Chapter 5: The Lotus Eaters**

Mr. Bloom walks along Sir John Rogerson's Quay, past the sailors' home. He passes a boy with offal and a girl with eczema. He thinks about the funeral of ""poor Dignam."" He stops at the Belfast and Oriental Tea Company window, reads about tea, and adjusts his hat. He reflects on Ceylon and the weight of falling bodies. He goes into the post office and asks for letters for ""Henry Flower Esq."" He receives a letter and a card. He slips them into his pocket, reflecting on soldiers and Maud Gonne.

M'Coy greets Bloom, asking about his health. Bloom tells him about Dignam's funeral. M'Coy says he heard about it from Holohan. Bloom observes a ""stylish kind of coat"" on a woman. M'Coy recounts how he heard of Dignam's death from Bob Doran. M'Coy asks Bloom to put his name down at the funeral, as he might be busy with a drowning case at Sandycove. Bloom agrees. Bloom reflects on M'Coy's ""softsoaping"" and Molly's upcoming concert tour. Bloom tells M'Coy that Molly is singing at a ""swagger affair"" in Belfast. M'Coy is glad.

Bloom walks on, reading the letter from ""Martha."" It's a love letter, asking when they will meet and what perfume his wife uses. She threatens to ""punish"" him if he doesn't write back. He tears the flower from the letter and puts it in his heart pocket. He reads the letter again, reflecting on Martha's ""indignant"" tone and his own ""weak joy."" He thinks of Molly and past arguments. He throws the pin from the letter on the road. He remembers a song about ""Mairy lost the pin of her drawers."" He crosses under a railway arch, tears the envelope into shreds, and scatters them. He thinks about money and the Guinness brewery.

He enters All Hallows church. He sees a sermon notice. He thinks about Father Conmee and the African Mission. He observes women taking communion, thinking of it as ""eating bits of a corpse."" He sits in a bench. He sees the priest rinsing the chalice. He thinks about Molly singing in church. He reflects on his own sins and Molly's past. He sees the priest bless the people. He notices his waistcoat buttons are open. He leaves the church, thinking about a lotion recipe he needs for Molly's skin. He remembers changing a sovereign for it.

He goes to Sweny's chemist. He asks for the lotion recipe. He thinks of Molly's delicate skin and the ""Peau d'Espagne"" perfume. He decides to buy a cake of lemon soap. Bantam Lyons stops him, asking for the newspaper to check a horse race. Bloom gives him the paper, saying he was ""just going to throw it away."" Lyons, misinterpreting this as a tip, takes the paper and rushes off. Bloom smiles, thinking about betting. He walks towards the Turkish baths, thinking about cricket and the pleasure of a bath.

Mrs. Breen greets Bloom, asking about Molly. Bloom says Milly has a position in Mullingar. Mrs. Breen notices Bloom is in black and he tells her about Dignam's funeral. She expresses sorrow. She then complains about her husband, Denis Breen, who is suing for libel over a postcard with ""U. p: up"" on it. She shows Bloom the card. Bloom points out a strange man, Cashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, who ""always walks outside the lampposts."" Mrs. Breen says her husband will be like that. She leaves to follow Denis.

Bloom reflects on the ""U. p: up"" postcard. He passes the _Irish Times_ office, thinking about other letters he receives and Lizzie Twigg's literary efforts. He thinks about women's appearances and Mrs. Miriam Dandrade. He thinks of Mrs. Purefoy, who is in the lying-in hospital. He reflects on childbirth and population. He passes Trinity College.

He passes Brown Thomas, admiring silks and ribbons. He thinks of Molly and her ""warm human plumpness.""

Bloom tells him about her tour and Blazes Boylan organizing it. Flynn mentions Boylan's luck with a boxing match. Davy Byrne comes forward. Flynn asks Byrne for a tip for the Gold Cup. Byrne says he never bets on horses. Bloom eats his sandwich. Flynn talks about horse races and Lenehan's tip for ""Sceptre."" Bloom reflects on wine, food, and Molly. He remembers kissing her on Howth. He thinks about the beauty of women and his own body. He sees two flies stuck on the window. He finishes his wine. He goes to the yard to urinate.

He thinks about his belly. He passes the Freemasons' hall. He sees a placard for the Mirus bazaar. He comes to Kildare Street, intending to go to the library. He sees ""Straw hat in sunlight. Tan shoes. Turnedup trousers. It is. It is."" He realizes it's Stephen. His heart ""quopped softly."" He swerves to the right, towards the museum, to avoid him. He feels his breath flutter. He quickly checks his pockets for ""Agendath Netaim"" and the soap. He finds the soap in his hip pocket and feels ""Safe!""

**Chapter 6: Hades**

Martin Cunningham, Mr. Power, and Simon Dedalus get into a funeral carriage. Mr. Bloom enters and sits in the vacant place. He reflects on corpses and the ""unclean job"" of preparing them. He realizes he has the soap in his hip pocket.

The carriage begins to move. They pass through Irishtown, Ringsend, and Brunswick Street. Mr. Dedalus comments on the custom of lifting hats for funerals. Bloom sees Stephen walking alone, clad in mourning, and points him out to Mr. Dedalus as ""Your son and heir."" Mr. Dedalus is angry, calling Mulligan a ""contaminated bloody doubledyed ruffian."" Bloom reflects on his own dead son, Rudy.

Mr. Power asks if they are late. Cunningham says ten minutes. Bloom thinks of Molly and Milly. The carriage lurches. Mr. Power and Mr. Dedalus notice crumbs on the seats, suggesting a ""picnic party."" Bloom is glad he took a bath. Mr. Dedalus sighs, saying ""it’s the most natural thing in the world."" Cunningham asks if Tom Kernan turned up. Bloom says he's behind with Ned Lambert and Hynes. Corny Kelleher is at the cemetery. Bloom mentions meeting M'Coy, who said he'd try to come.

They pass Nelson's pillar. Cunningham says they should look serious. Mr. Dedalus says poor Paddy wouldn't grudge a laugh. Mr. Power expresses sorrow for Dignam's sudden death.

The carriage stops. A drove of cattle passes. Mr. Power says ""Emigrants."" Bloom suggests a tramline for animals to the quays. He also suggests municipal funeral trams. Mr. Dedalus dismisses it.

He sees a ""paltry funeral"" with a hawker selling cakes. Mr. Kernan, Ned Lambert, and Hynes arrive. Corny Kelleher takes out wreaths. Bloom follows his companions. Cunningham whispers to Power about Bloom's father poisoning himself and Bloom's trip to Clare (anniversary). Power is shocked. Bloom asks if Dignam was insured. Kernan says yes, but mortgaged.

Menton remembers dancing with her. He asks what Bloom does. Lambert says he was a ""traveller for blottingpaper."" Menton asks why Molly married ""a coon like that."" Lambert says she ""Has still"" and Bloom ""does some canvassing for ads.""

John O'Connell, the caretaker, shakes their hands. Mr. Dedalus says he's come for another visit. O'Connell tells a story about two drunks looking for a grave.

He thinks about the ""gas of graves"" and ""whores in Turkish graveyards."" He thinks about the soil being ""fat with corpsemanure."" He reflects on jokes about the dead. The gravediggers prepare the hole. Bloom notices a ""lankylooking galoot over there in the macintosh."" He counts the heads: twelve. He thinks ""I’m thirteen. No. The chap in the macintosh is thirteen. Death’s number.""

The coffin is lowered. All uncover their heads. A donkey brays. Bloom thinks of his father's death. The gravediggers throw clay on the coffin. Bloom turns away. He thinks of the possibility of someone being buried alive. Hynes asks Bloom his Christian name to write it down. Bloom says ""Leopold"" and asks him to put down M'Coy's name too. Hynes writes it. Bloom reflects on Charley M'Coy. Hynes asks about the ""fellow in the Macintosh."" Bloom says he saw him but he's disappeared. A gravedigger comes. The clay falls softer. Bloom thinks about his own grave plot. The mourners move away. Hynes suggests going by ""the chief's grave"" (Parnell's). Mr. Power says some say Parnell is not in that grave. Hynes says he is. Bloom walks unheeded, thinking about spending money on charity for the living. Martin Cunningham emerges, talking to John Henry Menton. Bloom notices Menton's hat is crushed. He points it out. Menton takes it off, fixes it, and thanks him curtly. Bloom feels ""chapfallen."" He thinks ""Thank you. How grand we are this morning!""

**Chapter 7: Aeolus**

The scene opens with trams slowing and starting near Nelson's pillar in Dublin. Shoeblacks call out. Mailcars receive sacks of letters. Draymen roll barrels. Mr. Bloom is at the _Freeman_ office. Red Murray cuts out an advertisement for ""Alexander Keyes."" Bloom says he'll take it to the _Telegraph_ office. Red Murray offers to write a ""par"" (paragraph) for it. William Brayden, a stately figure, enters. Red Murray whispers that his face is like ""Our Saviour."" Bloom suggests ""Mario.""

Red Murray mentions the archbishop phoned twice. A telegram boy delivers a message. Bloom says the archbishop is ""one of our saviours also."" Bloom enters the printing works, passing clanking machines. He sees Hynes. He thinks about the machines and an old grey rat. Bloom halts behind Mr. Nannetti, the foreman. He shows him Keyes' ad, explaining Keyes wants ""two keys at the top"" and ""the house of keys"" (Manx parliament, innuendo of home rule). Nannetti agrees to do it if Keyes renews for three months. A typesetter brings a galleypage. Bloom thinks about spelling and a conundrum. He sees the machine jog forward, printing papers. Nannetti asks for the archbishop's letter to be repeated in the _Telegraph_. He calls for ""Monks."" Bloom decides to leave to get the design. Bloom passes old Monks, the ""dayfather,"" a bowed, spectacled man. He thinks about the variety of things Monks has set in type. Bloom watches a typesetter, thinking about reading backwards and his father's haggadah book. He reflects on ""Justice it means but it’s everybody eating everyone else.""

Bloom goes to the landing, thinking of phoning. He hears a ""screech of laughter"" from the _Evening Telegraph_ office. He enters. Professor MacHugh murmurs about ""Wilhelm Meister."" Mr. Dedalus complains about a ""heartburn on your arse."" Ned Lambert reads a flowery passage about ""Ireland’s portfolio."" Mr. Dedalus mocks it. Professor MacHugh calls it ""Bombast!"" J. J. O'Molloy enters, looking careworn. He asks to see the editor. Bloom thinks of O'Molloy's declining career. Myles Crawford, the editor, enters, asking ""What is it?"" Professor MacHugh calls him ""the sham squire."" Mr. Dedalus leaves for a drink. Crawford's eyes rove to Mr. Bloom's face. Crawford talks about the North Cork militia winning in ""Ohio!"" Lenehan whispers about ""Incipient jigs."" Bloom goes to the inner office to phone about an ad. He calls the _Evening Telegraph_ about an auction. Lenehan comes out with _Sport_'s tissues, offering a ""dead cert for the Gold cup."" Newsboys rush in. Professor MacHugh throws one out. Lenehan picks up the tissues. Bloom comes out of the office and bumps into Lenehan. Lenehan complains about his knee. Bloom apologizes. Bloom tells them he's going to Bachelor's walk about Keyes' ad. Crawford tells him ""Begone! The world is before you."" Bloom hurries out.

Lenehan and O'Madden Burke watch Bloom, followed by newsboys. Lenehan mimics Bloom's walk. Crawford, MacHugh, and O'Molloy discuss Roman civilization. MacHugh says Romans brought only ""his cloacal obsession"" to new shores. Lenehan mentions ""running stream."" O'Molloy mentions ""Roman law."" MacHugh says ""Pontius Pilate is its prophet."" Lenehan asks his riddle: ""What opera resembles a railwayline?"" He reveals the answer: ""_The Rose of Castile_."" Mr. O'Madden Burke enters with Stephen Dedalus. Stephen hands over Mr. Garrett Deasy's letter about foot and mouth disease. Crawford recognizes Deasy and his ""bloodiest old tartar"" wife. Stephen asks if Deasy is a widower. Crawford says ""Ay, a grass one."" MacHugh talks about being loyal to ""lost causes"" and the ""empire of the spirit."" Lenehan weeps for ""poor Pyrrhus."" Lenehan whispers a limerick about Professor MacHugh to Stephen. Crawford puts the letter in his pocket. Lenehan asks about his riddle again. O'Madden Burke is puzzled. Lenehan gives the answer. Crawford tells Stephen he wants him to write something ""with a bite in it."" He talks about Ignatius Gallaher's journalism. He shows them a map of the Phoenix Park murders. Bloom calls from the inner office. Crawford tells him to ""go to hell."" Crawford praises Gallaher's ""inspiration of genius"" in reporting the Phoenix Park murders. Lenehan calls him ""the father of scare journalism."" MacHugh mentions hawkers selling postcards of Joe Brady. O'Molloy recounts Lady Dudley seeing one. Crawford dismisses them as ""hook and eye department."" Stephen reflects on rhymes and the ""mouth south: tomb womb."" O'Molloy talks about Seymour Bushe's oratory in the Childs murder case, citing Michelangelo's Moses. O'Molloy asks Stephen about ""the hermetic crowd, the opal hush poets: A. E. the mastermystic."" He mentions Magennis thinks Stephen was ""pulling A. E.’s leg."" MacHugh recounts John F. Taylor's speech at the college historical society, arguing against the revival of Irish. Taylor's speech imagines an Egyptian high priest speaking to Moses, asking why Jews won't accept their culture. Taylor's speech then has Moses leading his people out of bondage.

O'Molloy notes Moses died without entering the promised land. Lenehan adds a cynical remark. Stephen suggests they adjourn for a drink. Lenehan declares ""Mooney’s!"" Crawford fumbles for his keys, pulling out the typesheets of Deasy's letter. He says it will be alright. O'Molloy quietly tells Stephen he hopes he lives to see his work published. MacHugh talks about ""prophetic vision"" and the fall of empires. Newsboys rush out, yelling ""Racing special!"" Stephen says he has a ""vision too."" Stephen describes his vision of ""Two Dublin vestals"" (Anne Kearns and Florence MacCabe) saving money to climb Nelson's pillar. They buy brawn and plums. They climb the pillar, afraid of the height.

Bloom, breathless, catches up with Crawford, saying he spoke to Keyes, who will renew for two months and wants a ""par"" in the _Telegraph_. Crawford tells him to tell Keyes he can ""kiss my arse."" Crawford says he's ""up to here"" with money troubles. O'Molloy pulls a long face. Stephen continues his story about the women on Nelson's pillar, pulling up their skirts to sit, and eating plums, spitting out the stones. Crawford says ""No poetic licence."" MacHugh likes ""Onehandled adulterer."" Crawford asks what Stephen calls his story. MacHugh suggests ""_deus nobis hæc otia fecit._"" Stephen calls it ""_A Pisgah Sight of Palestine_ or _The Parable of The Plums._"" MacHugh laughs, connecting it to Moses and the promised land. He then grimly smiles at Nelson's statue, calling him ""Onehandled adulterer.""

John Eglinton asks if he found ""six brave medicals"" to write ""Paradise Lost"" for ""Hamlet."" Stephen reflects on Mulligan. Eglinton suggests that ""Seven is dear to the mystic mind"" for Hamlet.

Stephen describes Shakespeare leaving his house, walking by the river, and then appearing as the ghost of King Hamlet, speaking to his son, young Hamlet (and to his own dead son, Hamnet). He proposes that Shakespeare foresaw the ""logical conclusion"": ""you are the dispossessed son: I am the murdered father: your mother is the guilty queen, Ann Shakespeare, born Hathaway?"" Russell objects to ""prying into the family life of a great man."" He says they have the plays, and the poet's life doesn't matter. Stephen reflects on his own debts. Eglinton says Shakespeare ""made a mistake"" and got out of it. Stephen rudely says a man of genius makes no mistakes. The Quaker librarian enters. Eglinton asks what Socrates learned from Xanthippe. Stephen says ""Dialectic"" and from his mother ""how to bring thoughts into the world."" Stephen argues that Shakespeare branded Ann Hathaway with infamy by not mentioning her for 34 years. He says she died 67 years after she was born and saw him into and out of the world. He mentions her borrowing money from her father's shepherd. Eglinton says the will has been explained by jurists. He recites a poem about Shakespeare leaving his ""Secondbest Bed"" to his wife. Stephen argues that Shakespeare was a ""rich country gentleman"" and should have left her his best bed. Mr. Best suggests there were two beds. Mulligan jokes ""_Separatio a mensa et a thalamo_."" Stephen describes Aristotle's death, freeing slaves and being kind to an old mistress. Mr. Best asks if he died so. Mulligan says ""He died dead drunk."" Mulligan recounts Dowden saying ""life ran very high in those days"" when asked about pederasty. Stephen presents Shakespeare as a ""cornjobber and moneylender,"" comparing him to Shylock, and linking his plays to historical events. Eglinton challenges Stephen to prove Shakespeare was a Jew. Stephen replies he was ""made in Germany, as the champion French polisher of Italian scandals."" Stephen, quoting Saint Thomas Aquinas, likens incest to ""avarice of the emotions,"" connecting it to Jews' intermarriage. He says a man who holds tightly to his rights over his debts will hold tightly to his rights over his wife. Mulligan interjects. Eglinton says Ann's will to live is the will to die. Stephen prays ""_Requiescat!_"" He describes her in the secondbest bed, taking up with gospellers, and reading chapbooks. He calls it ""an age of exhausted whoredom groping for its god.""

Stephen, battling hopelessness, says ""A father... is a necessary evil."" He argues that Shakespeare wrote Hamlet after his father's death and that ""Fatherhood... is unknown to man."" He calls it a ""mystical estate."" He says ""_Amor matris_... may be the only true thing in life."" Stephen discusses Sabellius's heresy that ""the Father was Himself His Own Son."" He connects this to Shakespeare being the father of his own son and of his race. Mulligan, clasping his paunch, exclaims, ""I am big with child. I have an unborn child in my brain. Pallas Athena! A play! The play’s the thing! Let me parturiate!"" Stephen talks about Shakespeare's brothers, Gilbert, Edmund, and Richard, and how their names appear in his plays. Mr. Best jokes about his own name, Richard. Stephen says Shakespeare hid his name in his plays but revealed it in the sonnets. He describes a star at Shakespeare's birth. Mr. Best mentions the ""brother motive"" in Irish myths and fairytales. The Quaker librarian asks if Stephen suggests ""misconduct with one of the brothers."" Stephen says the theme of the ""false or the usurping or the adulterous brother"" is always with Shakespeare. He connects it to banishment and original sin. He laughs to free his mind. Eglinton sums up: ""He is the ghost and the prince. He is all in all."" Stephen agrees, saying he acts and is acted on. Mulligan interjects ""Cuckoo!"" Stephen says Shakespeare returns to his birthplace, plants a mulberry tree, and dies. He says ""sorrow for the dead is the only husband from whom they refuse to be divorced.""

Eglinton asks if Stephen believes his own theory. Stephen says ""No."" Eglinton asks why he expects payment. Mulligan, laughing, reads a telegram from Stephen: ""The sentimentalist is he who would enjoy without incurring the immense debtorship for a thing done."" He mocks Stephen for sending it from ""the kips."" He complains about waiting for pints. Mulligan warns Stephen that ""The tramper Synge is looking for you... He heard you pissed on his halldoor."" Stephen says that was Mulligan's contribution to literature. An attendant announces a gentleman from the _Freeman_ wants to see the files. The Quaker librarian leads the way. Mulligan snatches the card and reads ""Bloom. Ikey Moses?"" He then speaks blasphemously about ""Jehovah, collector of prepuces"" and ""Venus Kallipyge."" Eglinton asks for more about Mrs. S. Stephen talks about Antisthenes giving the palm of beauty to Penelope. He recounts Manningham's story of Burbage and Shakespeare with the burgher's wife. Mulligan prays to ""Blessed Margaret Mary Anycock!"" Stephen talks about Ann Hathaway and her ""woman’s invisible weapon."" He argues that she was ""hot in the blood."" He challenges them to deny her infamy. Eglinton says the will has been explained. He says Shakespeare left his ""Secondbest Bed"" to his wife. Stephen argues about Shakespeare's wealth and why he didn't leave her his best bed. Mr. Best agrees there were two beds. Mulligan jokes about Dowden's view on pederasty. Stephen talks about Shakespeare as a moneylender and his ""jewbaiting."" Stephen quotes Saint Thomas Aquinas on incest. Mulligan interjects. Stephen rises. Eglinton says they will see him tonight. Mulligan, flaunting his telegram, says he'll be there and asks Stephen if he can walk straight. Stephen follows Mulligan out. Mulligan reads from his tablet, ""Everyman His Own Wife or A Honeymoon in the Hand (a national immorality in three orgasms) by Ballocky Mulligan."" He lists characters: Toby Tostoff, Crab, Medical Dick and Davy, Mother Grogan, Fresh Nelly, and Rosalie. He recounts a drunken night. A man passes. Mulligan whispers to Stephen that he is ""The wandering jew"" and that he ""looked upon you to lust after you."" He warns Stephen he is ""in peril."" Two plumes of smoke ascend from the housetops. Stephen reflects on peace.

Two urchins gape at his stump. He bays deeply at a window, and a card ""Unfurnished Apartments"" falls from it. A woman's hand throws a coin. An urchin picks it up and gives it to him.

Katey and Boody Dedalus enter their kitchen. Boody asks about pawned books. Maggy says they wouldn't give anything on them. Boody is angry. Katey asks what's in the pot; Maggy says ""Shirts,"" then ""Peasoup."" Dilly is gone to meet father. Boody says, ""Our father who art not in heaven."" A crumpled throwaway (""Elijah is coming"") floats down the Liffey.

Blazes Boylan is in Thornton's, a fruit shop. He gives a blond girl a bottle and a jar to put in a wicker basket with fruit. He checks his gold watch. He asks her to send the basket by tram, writing the address. He flirts with her, taking a red carnation and asking to use her telephone. Almidano Artifoni talks to Stephen, urging him to pursue singing. Stephen says he will reflect on it. Artifoni leaves. Miss Dunne hides a library book and types on her typewriter. She stares at a poster of Marie Kendall. The telephone rings. She takes messages, including one for Mr. Boylan about Lenehan being at the Ormond.

Maginni walks, unobserved. Blazes Boylan walks jauntily, with a red flower in his mouth, offering ""bold admiration"" to the ladies. Highland laddies blare after the cortège. Handicappers pursue. Cashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell stares through his eyeglass. Hornblower touches his cap. Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam raises his cap. The viceroy drives towards Lower Mount Street. A pedestrian in a brown macintosh eats dry bread. Mr. Eugene Stratton welcomes people to Pembroke township from a hoarding. Two sanded women watch. Almidano Artifoni's trousers are swallowed by a closing door.

Miss Douce and Miss Kennedy are in the Ormond bar. They hear the viceregal cavalcade pass. Miss Kennedy asks if it's ""her"" (Lady Dudley). Miss Douce says yes. Miss Douce points out a man in a tall silk hat in the second carriage. She laughs, saying ""He’s killed looking back."" Miss Kennedy laments ""It’s them has the fine times."" Bloom passes by, bearing ""the sweets of sin."" The boots (waiter Pat) brings teas to the barmaids. Miss Douce complains about the ""young brat"" (Pat). The barmaids wait for their tea to draw.

Mr. Dedalus enters, picking chips from his thumbnail. Miss Douce welcomes him. He asks about her holidays. He flirts with her, calling her ""naughty."" He orders whisky and water. Lenehan enters, asking if Mr. Boylan was looking for him. Miss Kennedy says no. Lenehan tries to amuse them with a fable about a fox and a stork, but they ignore him. He greets Mr. Dedalus, calling Stephen ""the youthful bard."" Lenehan says he ""quaffed the nectarbowl"" with Stephen, who received ""the rhino for the labour of his muse."" He names Professor MacHugh and O'Madden Burke as being there. Mr. Dedalus is amused. Mr. Dedalus notices the piano has been moved. Miss Douce says the tuner was in, and he was an ""exquisite player,"" and blind. Mr. Dedalus is surprised. Bloom sees a poster of a mermaid. He thinks about Martha and his letter. He sees a gay hat on a jaunting car (Boylan's). He decides to follow. He pays twopence for paper. From the saloon, a tuning fork sounds. Miss Douce and Miss Kennedy listen.

Blazes Boylan's shoes creak on the bar floor. Lenehan hails him: ""See the conquering hero comes."" Bloom, ""unconquered hero,"" walks warily. Boylan touches Miss Kennedy's hat. Miss Douce outsmiles her. Boylan orders drinks. Bloom sees Cowley's red lugs. He decides to join Richie Goulding for dinner in the diningroom. Miss Douce reaches for a flagon, stretching her satin arm, her bust, that all but burst, so high. Lenehan gasps. Boylan asks her why she doesn't grow. She replies, ""Fine goods in small parcels."" Boylan pays with a coin. Lenehan wishes him ""Fortune."" Boylan says ""Sceptre will win."" He says he plunged money ""Not on my own, you know. Fancy of a friend of mine."" The clock whirs and clacks. Miss Douce takes Boylan's coin. Boylan asks the time: ""Four?"" Lenehan urges Miss Douce to ring the bell. She nips her garter, which smacks against her thigh. Lenehan cries, ""_La cloche!_"" She smiles at Boylan. Boylan says he's ""off."" Lenehan tries to tell him about Tom Rochford. Boylan leaves. Lenehan follows.

Joe reads one from H. Rumbold, ""Master Barber,"" offering services for hanging. The Citizen calls him a ""barbarous bloody barbarian."" Bloom, trying to avoid a drink, orders a cigar. Alf talks about barbers who would hang their fathers for money and the ""two fellows waiting below to pull his heels down."" They discuss capital punishment. Bloom, using scientific terms, explains the phenomenon of a hanged man's erection. The Citizen launches into a tirade about the Invincibles, new Ireland, and Irish sports. He criticizes Bloom's dog. Bob Doran, drunk, starts playing with the dog. The Citizen and his dog ""talk"" in Irish. The dog's growls are presented as a ""marvellous exhibition of cynanthropy,"" with a poem about Barney Kiernan having no water. Terry brings water for the dog.

He talks about the ""black 47"" and the ""coffinships."" The Citizen criticizes the French as ""dancing masters"" and the Prussians/Hanoverians as ""sausageeating bastards.""

**Chapter 13: Nausicaa**

The summer evening begins on Sandymount strand. Three girl friends, Cissy Caffrey, Edy Boardman, and Gerty MacDowell, are on the rocks. Cissy and Edy have two young twin boys, Tommy and Jacky, in sailor suits, and a baby in a pushcar. The boys are playing in the sand. Cissy teases the baby. Tommy and Jacky quarrel over a sandcastle. Cissy scolds them and cleans Tommy. Edy asks who Tommy's sweetheart is, suggesting Gerty. Tommy denies it. Cissy whispers to Edy to take Tommy behind the pushcar to urinate.

Gerty MacDowell is described in detail: slight figure, pure face, Cupid's bow mouth, alabaster hands, blue eyes, dark brown hair. She has been taking iron jelloids and cut her hair that morning. She blushes at Edy's words. Gerty reflects on Reggy Wylie, a boy who rides a bicycle past her window and is studying to be a doctor. She feels a ""dull aching void"" for him. She is dressed carefully, hoping he might be out. She thinks about her underwear and luck. Gerty feels a ""gnawing sorrow."" She dreams of a marriage that will not be. She recalls Reggy stealing a kiss from her when they were young. She yearns for a ""manly man with a strong quiet face"" who would understand and comfort her. She longs to be his ""affianced bride."" Edy thinks about being his ""little wife."" She imagines caring for him with ""creature comforts"" and a ""beautifully appointed drawingroom.""

The twins quarrel again and throw the ball towards the sea. A ""gentleman in black"" (Leopold Bloom) intercepts it. Cissy asks him to throw it to her. He throws it, and it rolls under Gerty's skirt. Gerty tries to kick it but misses. Edy and Cissy laugh. Gerty tries again, lifting her skirt a little, and kicks it far. Gerty feels a ""warm flush."" She looks at the gentleman, meeting his ""wan and strangely drawn"" face. She sees ""whitehot passion"" in his eyes and feels he has made her his. She feels he can be trusted. She yearns to forgive him and make him fall in love with her.

Voices and organ music come from the church – a men's temperance retreat. Gerty reflects on her father's drinking and how it ruined their home. She hates men who lift a hand to a woman. She thinks of her father, his faults, and his singing. She remembers Mr. Dignam's sudden death. She is a ""sterling good daughter,"" managing the house.

Gerty notices Bloom's eyes on her, and feels a ""tingling in every nerve."" She feels he is ""eying her as a snake eyes its prey."" A ""burning scarlet swept from throat to brow."" She knows she has ""raised the devil in him."" Edy asks the time. Cissy goes to ask her ""uncle Peter"" (Bloom). Gerty notices Bloom's ""enormous control."" Bloom takes out his watch, says it's stopped, but thinks it's after eight. Cissy returns, saying his ""waterworks were out of order."" The church choir sings. Gerty swings her foot, feeling a ""sensation rushing all over her."" She knows Bloom is looking at her ""transparent stockings.""

Edy gets ready to go. Gerty, stung by Edy's remark about her ""best boy throwing her over,"" replies, ""I can throw my cap at who I like because it’s leap year."" She feels ""something aloof, apart, in another sphere."" Baby Boardman wets his bib. Gerty stifles an exclamation. The bell rings for benediction. A bat flies from the belfry. Gerty sees lighthouse lights. She thinks of her dreams and poetry. She thinks about whether the gentleman is married or a widower. She wants to be his ""dream of love."" Jacky shouts about fireworks. Gerty leans back to see them, revealing her legs. She feels his ""panting of his heart, his hoarse breathing."" She feels him draw her face to his. A rocket bursts, shedding ""rain gold hair threads"" and ""greeny dewy stars.""

Gerty glances at Bloom. He ""coloured like a girl."" He feels he has been a ""brute"" and an ""utter cad."" He feels ""infinite store of mercy in those eyes."" Cissy calls Gerty. Gerty waves a wadding from her pocket. She rises. She and Bloom exchange a ""last lingering glance."" She walks away, limping. Bloom watches her limp away, realizing she is lame. He thinks ""Jilted beauty. A defect is ten times worse in a woman."" He reflects on women, their periods, and his own desires. He thinks of Molly and Milly. He thinks about his letter to Martha. He stoops and turns over a piece of paper on the strand. He cannot read it. He thinks about writing a message for Gerty, but it would be washed away. He effaces letters in the sand. He thinks of his watch stopping. He sees a bat. He hears the church bells cooing. He thinks of Gerty MacDowell noticing the time.

**Chapter 14: Oxen of the Sun**

The chapter begins with a stylized discourse on procreation and the importance of maternity, emphasizing the care provided to pregnant women in the National Maternity Hospital. A ""man that wayfaring was"" (Leopold Bloom) stands by the hospital door at night. He is of ""Israel’s folk."" He has lived with his wife and daughter, who have ""long outwandered."" He remembers meeting his wife in town and not bowing to her. He now craves her forgiveness. A ""nursingwoman"" (Nurse Callan) opens the gate. She fears God will ""fordo with water"" mankind. Bloom asks about ""O’Hare Doctor"" (who is dead) and then about the woman in childbed (Mrs. Purefoy). The nurse says Mrs. Purefoy has been in throes for three days and it will be a hard birth. She tells him O'Hare died of ""bellycrab"" three years ago. Bloom is saddened.

A ""young learningknight yclept Dixon"" arrives. Bloom knows him from a previous encounter where Bloom was ""sore wounded in his breast by a spear"" and Dixon helped heal him. Dixon goes into the hospital to make merry. Bloom follows, ""sore of limb."" Inside, a ""board"" is set with ""frightful swords and knives,"" ""vessels wrought by magic,"" and ""strange fishes withouten heads."" There is a ""compost out of fecund wheatkidneys"" and ""brewage like to mead."" Dixon pours a drink for ""childe Leopold"" (Bloom), who discreetly empties most of it into his neighbor's glass. The ""good sister"" (Nurse Callan) begs them to stop their ""wassailing"" as a woman upstairs is in labor. Bloom hears cries. Lenehan, who is drunk, makes a crude remark about her labor. Bloom, ""the meekest man and the kindest,"" pledges a toast.

Scholars (Dixon, Lynch, Madden, Lenehan, Crotthers, Stephen, Costello) debate birth and righteousness. Madden argues the wife should live, the babe die. They argue heatedly. Stephen speaks of ""Godpossibled souls that we nightly impossibilise."" Costello makes a crude joke. Stephen speaks of ""mother Church"" and ""Lilith, patron of abortions."" He mentions Averroes and Moses Maimonides. Bachelors ask Bloom if he would risk life to save life. Bloom gives a cautious answer. Stephen says ""he who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the Lord."" Bloom is grave, thinking of his wife Marion and their dead son, who died on his eleventh day. He grieves for Stephen, who ""lived riotously with those wastrels and murdered his goods with whores."" Stephen fills cups. He shows ""glistering coins of the tribute and goldsmith notes the worth of two pound nineteen shilling"" for a song he wrote. He speaks of ""time’s ruins build eternity’s mansions"" and ""woman’s womb word is made flesh."" He speaks of the Virgin Mary and the ""second Eve."" He also mentions Peter Piscator and Joseph the joiner. Punch Costello sings a bawdy song. Nurse Quigley enters, angry, and stops them. She reminds them of ""lord Andrew"" and order. Costello is rebuked.

Dixon asks Stephen why he didn't take friar's vows. Stephen replies ""obedience in the womb, chastity in the tomb but involuntary poverty all his days."" Lenehan accuses Stephen of ""corruption of minors."" Stephen says he is ""the eternal son and ever virgin."" They mock him, describing a ""curious rite of wedlock."" Stephen speaks of ""Greater love than this... that a man lay down his wife for his friend."" He curses Erin for bringing in a stranger. He speaks of ""darkness of the interior."" A ""black crack of noise"" (thunder) is heard. Lynch warns Stephen. Stephen, initially boastful, shrinks. Bloom calms him, saying it's a ""natural phenomenon."" Stephen's fear is not vanquished. He thinks of ""Bird-in-the-Hand"" (a whore) and ""Carnal Concupiscence."" The company is deceived by this whore. A long, highly stylized passage summarizes the day's events: Dignam's funeral, the drought, the rain, Mulligan meeting Bannon, Bloom with the scholars, Mrs. Purefoy's labor, the midwives, her husband's fishing, and a prognostication of fire after wind and water.

Lenehan announces the letter is in the gazette. He talks about his ""sport gentleman"" life and gossip. He tells a story about ""Kerry cows"" and the plague. He speaks French. He describes his own wild youth. Bloom protests about the slaughter of cattle. Stephen, ""a little moved,"" says no such matter and mentions ""Doctor Rinderpest."" Vincent makes a joke about an ""Irish bull in an English chinashop."" They discuss the ""bull of Ireland"" and its pampering. They describe Lord Harry discovering his likeness to a bull and changing his name. The men of the island leave on a raft for America. Mulligan enters with Alec Bannon. Mulligan proposes a ""national fertilising farm"" called ""Omphalos"" on Lambay Island, offering his services for ""fecundation"" of females. He describes his diet. Dixon mocks him. Mulligan quotes Latin and uses animal analogies. Mulligan asks Bloom if he needs ""professional assistance."" Bloom replies he is there about a lady in ""an interesting condition."" Dixon asks Mulligan if his ""incipient ventripotence"" is ""ovoblastic gestation"" or a ""wolf in the stomach."" Mulligan laughs, saying ""There’s a belly that never bore a bastard."" A Scotch student congratulates Bannon. He talks about a picture he cherished of a woman. He laments not having his cloak. Mulligan jokes about a ""marchand de capotes."" Lynch makes a crude joke about nature and nakedness.

Miss Callan enters, announcing the birth of a ""bouncing boy"" to Mrs. Purefoy. The young surgeon (Dixon) defends his profession. Costello makes a crude remark but then affirms his ""honest Frank Costello"" sentiments. A long, scathing attack on Bloom's character and ""perverted transcendentalism"" is inserted. He is accused of being an ""alien,"" a ""traitor,"" a ""censor of morals,"" and of attempting ""illicit intercourse with a female domestic."" His ""peevish asperity"" and ""marital breast"" are mentioned. The news of the birth is formally announced. The delegates break out in argument. Bloom tries to calm them. The debate covers various obstetric and forensic topics. Mulligan makes a joke about a ""nice clean old man."" Malachi (Mulligan) tells a horrifying tale: a secret panel slides back, revealing Haines, with a portfolio of Celtic literature and a phial of ""Poison."" Haines confesses to murdering Samuel Childs and says his ""hell, and Ireland’s, is in this life."" He vanishes. The host (Mulligan) weeps. The seer (Stephen) murmurs ""The vendetta of Mananaun!"" The sage (Stephen) repeats ""Lex talionis."" Mulligan, overcome, ceases. The mystery is unveiled: Haines is the third brother, his real name is Childs, and the black panther is his father's ghost. He drinks drugs to forget. The house is haunted.

Bloom, ruminating, is transformed into ""young Leopold,"" walking to high school, then as a ""fullfledged traveller."" He then becomes ""paternal,"" thinking of his ""bridenight"" with Bridie Kelly and the ""daughter of night."" He laments having ""No son of thy loins."" The voices blend. The soul is wafted over ""regions of cycles of generations."" Twilight phantoms fade. ""Agendath is a waste land."" The ""ghosts of beasts"" tramp towards the ""Lacus Mortis."" The ""equine portent"" grows, becoming the ""everlasting bride,"" Martha, Millicent, ""a queen among the Pleiades."" Francis reminds Stephen of school. Stephen speaks of the past and its phantoms. He is ""Bous Stephanoumenos, bullockbefriending bard."" Vincent praises him. Lenehan tells of the horse race where ""Throwaway"" won. Vincent describes a beautiful woman (Molly) in a yellow dress. He mentions Conmee blessing them. Lenehan says ""The gods too are ever kind."" Bloom, who has been listening, sees the other man (Lenehan) trying to take a drink. Bloom intervenes, pouring a lot of it out. The debate continues, covering various characters and topics.

**Chapter 15: Circe**

The scene opens at the Mabbot Street entrance to Nighttown, a brothel district. Calls and answers are heard. A deafmute idiot passes. A pygmy woman counts. A figure sprawled against a dustbin snores. A gnome shoulders a sack of rags. A crone makes for her lair. A bandy child crawls after her. A drunken navvy grips railings. Two night watchmen loom. A plate crashes, a woman screams, a child wails. Cissy Caffrey sings a bawdy song. Private Carr and Private Compton, soldiers, march unsteadily, farting. Laughter. A virago retorts. Cissy sings again. Stephen and Lynch pass the redcoats. The privates mock Stephen. Stephen chants a Latin introit. A bawd offers ""Maidenhead inside."" Stephen continues chanting. The bawd spits, calling them ""Trinity medicals."" Edy Boardman bickers with Bertha Supple about a ""squarepusher"" and a ""married highlander."" Stephen flourishes his ashplant, shattering light. He says gesture, not music or odour, is a universal language. Lynch calls it ""Pornosophical philotheology."" Stephen speaks of Shakespeare and Socrates being ""shrewridden."" He gives Lynch his ashplant. The navvy ejects a long liquid jet of snot. He staggers away. River fog creeps. A glow leaps in the south.

Leopold Bloom appears, flushed, panting, cramming bread and chocolate into his pocket. He sees Nelson's image in a hairdresser's window and his own distorted reflection. He buys a pig's crubeen and a sheep's trotter from a porkbutcher. He feels a ""stitch in my side."" Bloom sees a ""big blaze"" (the brigade). He hums ""London's burning."" He sees the navvy and runs to catch him. He darts across the road. Two cyclists graze him. He halts, stung by a spasm. A dragon sandstrewer nearly hits him. The motorman yells at him. Bloom blunders out of the track. Bloom brushes mud from his cheek. He thinks about Sandow's exercises and street accidents. He feels ""Bit light in the head."" A sinister figure (Gaelic league spy) asks for a password. Bloom tries to pass a ragman. Jacky Caffrey runs into Bloom. Bloom checks his pockets. A retriever sniffs.

She points to Bridie Kelly, who runs away. The bawd says he won't get a virgin in the flash houses. Gerty MacDowell limps forward, showing her ""bloodied clout"" and accusing Bloom: ""You did that. I hate you."" Bloom denies it. The bawd calls Gerty a ""cheat."" Gerty tells Bloom he saw ""all the secrets of my bottom drawer.""

Mrs. Breen asks Bloom why he didn't kiss the spot. She offers a ""pigeon kiss."" Bloom is shocked. Richie Goulding appears with his legal bag, full of polonies and pills.

He says he's ""in a grave predicament."" Mrs. Breen calls his story ""cock and bull."" Bloom tries to tell her a secret. They walk on. Bloom recounts a memory of Fairyhouse races with Molly and Mrs. Breen. Mrs. Breen corrects him to Leopardstown. Bloom describes Molly winning money and Mrs. Breen's hat. He compliments Mrs. Breen. Bloom mentions Molly eating a sandwich from Mrs. Joe Gallaher's basket. He criticizes Mrs. Gallaher's style. He mentions Rogers and Maggot O'Reilly mimicking a cock. Mrs. Breen fades.

Bloom passes cheap whores. He hears a gramophone blare ""The Holy City."" The navvy, gripping two redcoats, staggers forward, shouting ""We are the boys. Of Wexford."" Bloom is at fault. The dog pants. Bloom thinks it's a ""Wildgoose chase."" He sees a chalked legend ""Wet Dream."" Gaudy dollwomen loll. The retriever sniffs his hand. Bloom tries to give it the crubeen and trotter.

Mrs. Talboys threatens to ""scourge the pigeonlivered cur."" Bloom ""quails expectantly."" The women threaten to flog, tan, and geld Bloom. Bloom trembles, offering the other cheek. Mrs. Talboys orders his trousers to be taken down.

Davy Stephens passes, announcing ""new addresses of all the cuckolds in Dublin."" Canon O'Hanlon elevates a marble timepiece, which coos ""Cuckoo."" The brass quoits of a bed jingle. A panel of fog rolls back, revealing jurors: Martin Cunningham, Jack Power, Simon Dedalus, Tom Kernan, Ned Lambert, John Henry Menton, Myles Crawford, Lenehan, Paddy Leonard, Nosey Flynn, M'Coy, and a Nameless One. The Nameless One snarls about Bloom organizing a woman. The Recorder (Sir Frederick Falkiner) appears, with Mosaic ramshorns, and sentences Bloom to be hanged. Long John Fanning asks ""Who’ll hang Judas Iscariot?"" H. Rumbold, ""Master Barber,"" mounts the block. The bells of George's church toll. Bloom desperately tries to speak. The beagle lifts his snout, revealing the face of Paddy Dignam, who says ""It is true. It was my funeral."" He explains he died of ""bellycrab"" (apoplexy). He says he is there ""By metempsychosis. Spooks."" He needs to satisfy an ""animal need."" John O'Connell, the caretaker, appears with Father Coffey. Dignam's voice is heard baying underground. Tom Rochford leaps into the coalhole.

Bloom plodges forward. Kisses chirp. He stands before a lighted house. Zoe Higgins accosts him, saying ""He’s inside with his friend."" Bloom asks if it's Mrs. Mack's. Zoe says it's Mrs. Cohen's and that her mother is ""on the job herself tonight."" She asks if Bloom is his father. Bloom denies it.

The man disappears. Bloom strikes down poppies. His bodyguard distributes gifts. Women press to touch his robe. Lady Gwendolen Dubedat kisses him. Babes clap for ""Poldy."" Bloom pokes Baby Boardman. He shakes hands with a blind stripling, embraces an old couple, plays with children, performs juggling tricks, consoles a widow, dances, kisses bedsores, trips a policeman, whispers to a waitress, eats a raw turnip, refuses money from Hynes, gives his coat to a beggar, and races cripples.

Brini, Papal Nuncio, recites a long, absurd genealogy of Bloom, ending with ""_et vocabitur nomen eius Emmanuel._"" A deadhand writes ""Bloom is a cod"" on the wall. Crab and a female infant accuse him of deeds in Kilbarrack and Ballybough. A hollybush asks about the devil's glen. Bloom blushes, asking to ""Spare my past."" The Irish Evicted Tenants sjambok him. Bloom seats himself in the pillory. Artane orphans and Prison Gate Mission girls caper around him, singing. Hornblower announces he will carry the sins of the people to Azazel and Lilith.
