A Doll_s House-Henrik Ibsen,"This detailed summary is based solely on the provided text of ""A Doll's House.""

**Act I**

The play opens in the comfortably furnished home of Nora and Torvald Helmer during winter. Nora enters in high spirits, carrying Christmas parcels, and instructs the maid to hide the Christmas tree from the children. She secretly eats macaroons, which her husband, Torvald, has forbidden. Torvald, a lawyer who is soon to become manager of the Bank, enters, playfully calling Nora his ""little lark"" and ""little squirrel,"" and chides her for being a ""spendthrift."" Nora argues that they can afford to spend more now that Torvald has a secure, high-paying position, but Torvald insists on no debt or borrowing, believing it destroys freedom and beauty in a home. He gives her money for Christmas, and Nora shows him the inexpensive gifts she bought for their three children (Ivar, Bob, and Emmy) and the maids, but keeps one parcel secret. When asked what she wants, Nora suggests money, which she claims she will save to buy something for herself, though Torvald doubts her ability to save. He also observes her looking uneasy and teases her about eating sweets, which she denies.

Nora asks if Doctor Rank has been invited for Christmas dinner, and Torvald confirms he will come. They discuss their plans for Christmas and Nora's past efforts to make Christmas ornaments, which were ruined by a cat. A bell rings, and the maid announces a lady caller and Doctor Rank. Torvald goes into his study with Dr. Rank.

The visitor is Mrs. Linde, an old school friend whom Nora initially doesn't recognize due to her changed appearance. Mrs. Linde reveals she is a widow of three years, with no children, and her husband left her nothing. She explains she married him to provide for her bedridden mother and two younger brothers, but now her mother has died and her brothers are self-sufficient, leaving her feeling ""unspeakably empty"" and in need of work. Nora expresses delight at Torvald's new bank position, which will bring them financial security, and promises to speak to Torvald about getting Mrs. Linde a job.

Nora then reveals a secret to Mrs. Linde: she was the one who procured the money for Torvald's life-saving trip to Italy eight years ago, not her father, as Torvald believes. She explains that Torvald had overworked himself and become dreadfully ill, and doctors said he needed to go south. Knowing Torvald's strong opinions against borrowing and his ""manly independence,"" Nora secretly borrowed two hundred and fifty pounds. She tried to persuade Torvald to travel by pretending she wanted to travel like other young wives, using tears and entreaties, and even hinting at a loan, but he refused. Her father died around the same time, preventing Nora from asking him to sign the bond or revealing her secret to him. Nora has been secretly repaying the loan through ""odds and ends, needlework, crotchet-work, embroidery,"" and copying work, often buying the cheapest clothes for herself to save money, and always ensuring Torvald had a good table and the children were well-dressed. She describes the difficulty of managing quarterly interest and installments. She is now ""free from care"" as the debt is almost paid off.

Krogstad, a lawyer, arrives and asks to speak with Helmer about bank business. Mrs. Linde recognizes him and trembles, revealing she knew him many years ago when he was a solicitor's clerk. Dr. Rank emerges from Helmer's study and mentions Krogstad is a ""morally diseased"" man who is currently with Helmer. Nora, amused by the idea of Torvald having power over so many people, offers Dr. Rank a macaroon, which Torvald has forbidden her to eat. Dr. Rank confesses he thought macaroons were forbidden. Nora then playfully admits she would love to say ""Well, I'm damned!"" if Torvald could hear her.

Helmer joins them, and Nora introduces Mrs. Linde, exaggerating that Mrs. Linde traveled to see Helmer and is ""tremendously clever at book-keeping"" and ""frightfully anxious to work."" Helmer, learning Mrs. Linde is a widow with experience, says he may be able to find her a position. Helmer, Dr. Rank, and Mrs. Linde leave for a walk. Nora plays with her children, but Krogstad returns, finding the outer door ajar.

Krogstad confronts Nora, stating he knows about her influence and that Mrs. Linde is taking his position at the bank. He demands Nora use her influence to ensure he keeps his ""subordinate position."" Nora denies having such influence, but Krogstad threatens to expose her secret loan and forgery. He reminds her that when she borrowed the money, she signed a bond, and her father was supposed to sign as surety. Krogstad reveals that her father's signature on the bond is dated three days *after* his death, and the date itself is not in her father's handwriting. Nora confesses she forged her father's signature because he was dying, and she couldn't tell him Torvald's life was in danger. Krogstad warns her that the law cares nothing for motives and that her action constitutes fraud. He declares that if he loses his position, she will lose hers with him. Nora dismisses his threats, believing she did it ""for love's sake.""

Helmer returns and immediately senses Krogstad has been there begging Nora to intercede for him. He scolds Nora for speaking with Krogstad and lying to him. Helmer reveals he has the authority to make changes at the bank and plans to dismiss Krogstad. He explains that Krogstad ""forged someone's name"" and that such a ""guilty man"" poisons his home with lies, infecting his children. Helmer makes Nora promise not to plead Krogstad's cause, stating he feels ""physically ill"" in Krogstad's company and cannot work with him due to his past ""indiscretion"" and overly familiar behavior. Nora is left terrified, whispering, ""No, no—it isn’t true. It’s impossible; it must be impossible."" She refuses to let her children come in, fearing she might ""deprave"" or ""poison"" them.

**Act II**

Nora is anxious and uneasy, looking for letters in the letterbox. She speaks to the Nurse, asking if her children would forget her if she ""went away altogether,"" and inquires about the Nurse's own experience of leaving her child to work for Nora's family. Mrs. Linde arrives to help Nora mend her Neapolitan fisher-girl costume for the fancy-dress ball.

Nora confides in Mrs. Linde about Dr. Rank's dangerous illness, consumption of the spine, which she attributes to his father's excesses. Mrs. Linde, noticing Dr. Rank's frequent visits, questions his sincerity and suggests Nora should ""make an end of it"" with him. She then guesses that Dr. Rank lent Nora the money, but Nora vehemently denies it, stating he had no money then. Nora confirms she needs to ""make an end of it with the other one"" (Krogstad).

Helmer returns, and Nora attempts once more to persuade him to keep Krogstad, arguing that Krogstad writes for ""scurrilous newspapers"" and can do Helmer ""unspeakable amount of harm."" Helmer dismisses her fears, attributing them to her thinking of her father's past reputation. He reiterates that he cannot keep Krogstad due to his moral failings and, more importantly, because Krogstad's familiar tone (""I say, Helmer, old fellow!"") would make Helmer appear weak and swayed by outside influence to his staff. Helmer calls Nora ""narrow-minded"" for questioning his reasoning and sends the maid with Krogstad's dismissal letter.

Nora is distraught, begging Helmer to recall the letter for their sake and the children's. Helmer says it's too late and embraces her, assuring her he will have ""courage and strength"" and is ""man enough to take everything upon myself"" if anything comes of it. He then tells her to practice her Tarantella dance.

Dr. Rank arrives, and Nora tries to prevent him from seeing Torvald, but he insists. Dr. Rank reveals he is terminally ill with ""consumption of the spine"" and will soon be ""rotting in the churchyard."" He explains his illness is a ""penalty for another man's sin"" (his father's excesses). He tells Nora he will send her a card with a black cross when his ""loathsome end"" has begun, and he will bar Helmer from his sick-room because Helmer has a ""disgust at everything that is ugly."" Dr. Rank then confesses his love for Nora, saying he would ""gladly give his life for your sake."" Nora is shocked and distressed by his confession, which prevents her from asking him for the ""tremendously big favour"" she had intended to ask.

The maid brings Nora a card, which Nora hides, telling Dr. Rank it's about a new dress. She sends Dr. Rank to keep Helmer occupied. Krogstad enters through the back stairs, having received his dismissal. He tells Nora he will not accuse her but demands to be reinstated at the bank in a higher position, becoming Helmer's ""right hand."" He states he has a letter in his pocket for Helmer, telling him everything ""in as lenient a manner as I possibly could."" Nora desperately tries to get him to tear up the letter, offering to find money, but Krogstad refuses to part with the bond. He warns her against doing anything foolish, like running away or something worse, as he would still have Helmer ""completely in my power."" As Krogstad leaves, he drops the letter into the letterbox.

Nora shows Mrs. Linde the letter in the letterbox and confesses she ""forged a name."" She asks Mrs. Linde to be her witness if she goes out of her mind or disappears, stating she alone did the whole thing. Mrs. Linde believes the secret must be disclosed to Helmer for their own good. Mrs. Linde offers to go and speak to Krogstad, revealing there was a time when he ""would gladly do anything for my sake."" Nora distracts Helmer from checking the letterbox by insisting he help her practice the Tarantella, claiming she has forgotten it and is ""dreadfully afraid."" Helmer agrees, promising to dedicate the evening to her and not open any letters. Nora dances wildly, as if her life depends on it, while Helmer and Dr. Rank watch. Mrs. Linde returns, and Nora calls for champagne and macaroons. Helmer and Dr. Rank go to dinner. Mrs. Linde informs Nora that Krogstad has gone out of town but is ""coming home tomorrow evening."" Nora says she is waiting for ""a wonderful thing to happen.""

**Act III**

Mrs. Linde is waiting alone in the Helmers' living room, listening for Krogstad. He arrives, and they discuss their past. Mrs. Linde explains she broke their engagement years ago because she had to provide for her sick mother and younger brothers, and Krogstad's prospects seemed hopeless. Krogstad admits he felt ""shipwrecked"" after losing her. Mrs. Linde proposes they join forces, as she feels her life is ""unspeakably empty"" without someone to care for. She knows about his past and his reputation but has faith in his ""real character"" and wants to be a mother to his children. Krogstad is overjoyed.

Krogstad mentions the letter he sent to Helmer, and Mrs. Linde, believing that ""this unhappy secret must be disclosed"" for Helmer and Nora to have a ""complete understanding,"" tells him not to recall it. Krogstad agrees, saying he will wait for her below. Mrs. Linde tidies the room, reflecting on the difference having someone to work and live for makes.

Helmer and Nora return from the ball. Helmer is in high spirits, praising Nora's Tarantella and her beauty, but also calling her ""terribly self-willed."" He describes how he brought her home early to preserve the ""effect"" of her performance. Nora, in a hurried whisper, asks Mrs. Linde what happened with Krogstad. Mrs. Linde confirms she spoke to him and reiterates that Nora ""must tell your husband all about it,"" as the letter will otherwise. Nora responds, ""I knew it,"" and says, ""Now I know what I must do.""

Mrs. Linde leaves after Helmer makes condescending remarks about her knitting. Helmer then expresses his desire for Nora, describing how he imagines her as his ""secretly promised bride."" Nora rebuffs his advances, telling him to go away.

Dr. Rank makes an unexpected final visit. He confirms he has received ""certainty"" about his illness, implying his death is imminent, and that he will be ""invisible"" at the next fancy-dress ball. He asks Helmer for a cigar, and Nora lights it for him. He says goodbye, and Helmer remarks he has ""drunk more than he ought.""

Helmer goes to empty the letterbox. He finds two cards from Dr. Rank with black crosses over his name, which Nora confirms is Dr. Rank's way of announcing his impending death. Helmer is saddened but also notes that his death will leave them ""thrown quite upon each other now."" He expresses a wish that Nora might be threatened by danger so he could risk his life for her. Nora firmly tells him to read his letters. Helmer initially resists, wanting to be with her, but then agrees, saying the thought of death has come between them. He goes into his room to read the letters.

Nora, in a state of terror, whispers about never seeing Helmer or her children again, contemplating the ""icy, black water."" Helmer rushes out of his room with an open letter, calling her name. He demands to know if she knows what is in the letter. Nora confirms she does and tries to escape, saying, ""You shan’t save me, Torvald!"" Helmer, reeling, reads the letter and calls Nora a ""miserable creature,"" a ""hypocrite, a liar—worse, worse—a criminal!"" He blames her father's ""want of principle"" for her actions and declares she has ""destroyed all my happiness"" and ""ruined all my future"" by putting him in the power of an ""unscrupulous man."" He fears being falsely suspected of complicity.

Nora, now cold and quiet, acknowledges she understands. Helmer states they must maintain appearances, but he will no longer allow her to bring up the children, as he ""dare not trust them"" to her. He declares his love for her is ""all over"" and that only ""the remains, the fragments, the appearance"" matter.

Just then, a second letter arrives from Krogstad. Helmer reads it and shouts with joy, exclaiming, ""I am saved! Nora, I am saved!"" He reveals Krogstad has sent back Nora's bond, regretting his actions due to a ""happy change in his life."" Helmer tears up the bond and both letters, burning them in the stove, declaring, ""now it doesn’t exist any longer."" He then ""forgives"" Nora, attributing her actions to ""womanly helplessness"" and lack of understanding, and promises to protect her, saying she has become ""both wife and child to him.""

Nora, in her everyday dress, returns to confront Helmer. She states this is their first serious conversation in eight years of marriage. She tells him he has never understood her, and she has never understood him until tonight. She asserts that she has been ""greatly wronged,"" first by her father and then by him, having been treated like a ""doll-child"" and a ""doll-wife,"" living merely to ""perform tricks"" and adopting his tastes. She declares she has never been happy, only merry, and their home has been a ""playroom.""

Nora tells Helmer he is ""not the man to educate me into being a proper wife for you"" and that she is ""not fit"" to bring up the children. She announces she is leaving him and the children to ""educate myself"" and ""understand myself and everything about me."" Helmer forbids her, reminding her of her ""most sacred duties"" to her husband and children. Nora counters that she has ""other duties just as sacred""—duties to herself. She no longer believes she is primarily a wife and mother, but a ""reasonable human being"" who must think for herself. She questions the law and religion, finding them illogical if they condemn saving a father or husband.

Helmer accuses her of being ill or out of her mind, but Nora states her mind has never been clearer and confirms she no longer loves him. She explains that the ""wonderful thing"" she hoped for—Helmer sacrificing his honor for her—did not happen. Instead, when the threat was over, he acted as if nothing had happened, treating her as his ""little skylark, your doll,"" which made her realize she had been living with a ""strange man"" for eight years. She rejects his offer to live like ""brother and sister.""

Nora returns her wedding ring and takes back hers, declaring both of them free from all obligations. She states she will not see the children, believing they are in better hands. She refuses any future contact or help from Helmer, calling him a ""stranger."" She concludes that for their life together to be a ""real wedlock,"" both would have to change so much that she no longer believes in such ""wonderful things."" Nora leaves the house, and the sound of a door shutting is heard from below. Helmer is left alone, pondering ""The most wonderful thing of all—?"""
Alice_s Adventures in Wonderland-Lewis Carroll,"Alice, growing tired of sitting idly by her sister on a riverbank, notices a White Rabbit with pink eyes, wearing a waistcoat, taking a watch from its pocket, and exclaiming, ""Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!"" Driven by curiosity, Alice follows the Rabbit down a large rabbit-hole.

She falls for a long time down what feels like a very deep well, passing cupboards, bookshelves, maps, and pictures. She retrieves an empty jar of ""ORANGE MARMALADE"" from a shelf and places it in another cupboard. During her descent, she muses about her location and talks to herself about her cat, Dinah. She eventually lands, unhurt, on a pile of sticks and dry leaves.

Alice sees the White Rabbit again, hurrying down a passage, still muttering about being late. She follows it into a long, low hall lined with many locked doors. On a small glass table, she finds a tiny golden key. The key is too small for the main doors, but she discovers a small door, about fifteen inches high, hidden behind a curtain. The golden key fits this lock, and Alice opens it to reveal a beautiful garden. However, she is too large to fit through the doorway.

Returning to the table, Alice finds a bottle labeled ""DRINK ME."" After prudently checking that it is not marked ""poison,"" she drinks the liquid, which tastes like a mixture of various foods. She begins to shrink rapidly, becoming only ten inches high. Delighted at first, she then realizes she left the golden key on the table and cannot reach it. She sits down and cries, creating a large pool of tears around her.

The White Rabbit reappears, splendidly dressed, carrying white kid gloves and a fan, hurrying and muttering about the Duchess. Alice timidly asks for help, startling the Rabbit, who drops his items and flees. Alice picks up the fan and gloves. As she fans herself, she begins to shrink again. She realizes the fan is causing her to diminish and quickly drops it, narrowly avoiding disappearing entirely, and finds herself about two feet tall. She rushes back to the little door, but it is shut, and the key is still on the unreachable table.

Her foot slips, and she falls into the pool of tears she had wept, now swimming in salt water. She encounters a Mouse and attempts to converse with it, first in English, then in French (""Où est ma chatte?""), which offends the Mouse due to the mention of ""cat."" Alice apologizes but then inadvertently praises her own cat, Dinah, for catching mice, further upsetting the Mouse. She tries to change the subject to dogs, but again mentions their rat-killing abilities, causing the Mouse to swim away in a commotion. Alice calls it back, promising not to mention cats or dogs. The Mouse returns, agreeing to tell its history once they reach the shore.

The pool becomes crowded with other animals and birds (a Duck, a Dodo, a Lory, an Eaglet, and others) who have also fallen in. Alice leads them to the bank. The group is all wet and uncomfortable. The Mouse attempts to dry them by reciting a ""driest thing"" (a history lesson about William the Conqueror), but it fails to dry them and is interrupted by the other animals. The Dodo then proposes a ""Caucus-race"" as a more effective remedy. The race involves running in a circle, starting and stopping whenever one likes. After about half an hour, when everyone is dry, the Dodo declares that ""Everybody has won, and all must have prizes."" Alice is designated to distribute the prizes, giving each creature a comfit from her pocket. For her own prize, the Dodo solemnly presents Alice with her own thimble.

The party then asks the Mouse to tell its history, specifically why it hates ""C and D"" (cats and dogs). The Mouse begins a ""long and a sad tale,"" which Alice visualizes as a poem printed in the shape of a long tail. Alice's interruptions and misinterpretations (""knot"" for ""not"") offend the Mouse, who walks away. Alice mentions her cat, Dinah, again, praising her hunting skills, which causes all the other birds and animals to flee in fear, leaving Alice alone and sad.

Soon, the White Rabbit returns, frantically searching for his lost fan and gloves and muttering about the Duchess and execution. He mistakes Alice for his housemaid, Mary Ann, and orders her to fetch a new pair of gloves and a fan from his house. Alice, frightened, obeys and finds the Rabbit's house. Inside, she finds a fan and gloves. She also sees a bottle and, hoping to grow larger, drinks from it. She grows rapidly, her head hitting the ceiling, then she has to kneel, and eventually, she is so large she has one arm out the window and one foot up the chimney, completely stuck.

The Rabbit arrives outside, calling for Mary Ann. He tries to open the door, but Alice's elbow blocks it. He decides to enter through the window. Alice snatches at him through the window, causing a shriek, a fall, and broken glass. The Rabbit calls for ""Pat"" (another voice), who identifies Alice's arm in the window. The Rabbit orders Pat to remove the arm. Alice snatches again, causing more shrieks and broken glass. A rumbling of cartwheels and voices indicates a plan to use ladders and send ""Bill"" the Lizard down the chimney. Alice kicks her foot down the chimney, sending Bill flying out. The Rabbit suggests burning the house down, but Alice threatens to set her cat Dinah on them, causing a momentary silence. Pebbles are thrown in the window, which turn into little cakes on the floor. Alice eats one, hoping to shrink, and she does. As soon as she is small enough, she runs out of the house, escaping the crowd of animals and birds (including Bill the Lizard, who is being revived).

Alice finds herself in a thick wood, planning to return to her proper size and find the garden. She encounters an enormous puppy, which frightens her. She plays with it using a stick to distract it, then escapes when it rests. She realizes she needs to eat or drink something to grow or shrink. She finds a large mushroom and, looking over its edge, sees a large blue Caterpillar smoking a hookah.

The Caterpillar questions Alice's identity, to which Alice replies she hardly knows, having changed sizes so many times. They argue about the nature of change. The Caterpillar asks Alice to recite ""You are old, Father William,"" but Alice recites a distorted version. The Caterpillar declares it ""wrong from beginning to end."" It then asks Alice what size she wants to be. Alice expresses a desire to be a little larger than her current three inches, which offends the Caterpillar (who is exactly three inches tall). The Caterpillar eventually crawls away, but not before telling Alice that one side of the mushroom will make her grow taller and the other side will make her grow shorter. Alice breaks off a piece from each side. She nibbles the right-hand bit and shrinks so rapidly her chin hits her foot. She then eats some of the left-hand bit, and her head becomes free, but her neck extends to an immense length. A large Pigeon flies into her face, screaming ""Serpent!"" and accuses her of trying to steal its eggs. Alice protests that she is a ""little girl,"" but the Pigeon insists she is a serpent if she eats eggs. Alice, tired of the argument, uses the mushroom pieces to carefully adjust her size until she returns to her ""usual height."" She then sees a small house and decides to shrink herself to nine inches before approaching it.

Alice observes a Fish-Footman deliver a croquet invitation from the Queen to a Frog-Footman, who then sits staring blankly. Alice enters the house and finds a smoky kitchen where the Duchess is nursing a constantly sneezing and howling baby, while a Cook stirs a peppery soup. A Cheshire Cat grins on the hearth. Alice asks why the cat grins, and the Duchess explains it's a Cheshire cat. The Cook begins throwing kitchen items at the Duchess and baby. The Duchess sings a violent lullaby to the baby, then flings it at Alice, telling her to nurse it while she goes to play croquet. Alice struggles to hold the oddly shaped, grunting baby. She carries it outside, fearing for its safety, and observes its pig-like features. The baby eventually turns into a pig, and Alice sets it down, watching it trot away into the wood.

Alice then encounters the Cheshire Cat sitting on a tree bough. She asks it which way to go. The Cat replies it depends on where she wants to get, and that everyone there, including the Hatter and March Hare, is mad. The Cat explains its own madness by saying it growls when pleased and wags its tail when angry. The Cat asks if Alice will play croquet with the Queen and then vanishes, only to reappear moments later to ask about the baby, which Alice confirms turned into a pig. The Cat vanishes again, leaving only its grin, which slowly fades. Alice proceeds towards the March Hare's house, which has unusual features like ear-shaped chimneys and a fur-thatched roof. She shrinks herself to two feet high before approaching.

Alice finds the March Hare and the Hatter having tea at a large table, with a Dormouse asleep between them, used as a cushion. They claim there's ""No room!"" but Alice sits down. They offer her wine, but there is none, leading to an argument about civility and meaning what you say. The Hatter asks, ""Why is a raven like a writing-desk?"" but neither he nor the March Hare knows the answer. The Hatter checks his watch, which tells the day of the month but not the time, blaming the March Hare for putting butter in it. He explains that he and ""Time"" quarreled, so it's ""always six o’clock"" (tea-time) for them, forcing them to constantly move around the table. The Dormouse, repeatedly woken up, tells a nonsensical story about three sisters living in a ""treacle-well"" and drawing ""treacle"" and things beginning with ""M."" Alice questions the story, but the Hatter and March Hare are rude and dismissive. Disgusted, Alice leaves the tea-party, noting they are trying to put the Dormouse into the teapot.

Alice finds a door in a tree, which leads back to the long hall. She uses the golden key and a piece of the mushroom (which she had kept) to shrink herself to about a foot high, and finally enters the beautiful garden.

In the garden, Alice sees three gardeners (shaped like playing cards) painting white roses red, explaining they planted the wrong color and fear the Queen's wrath. A grand procession arrives: soldiers, courtiers, royal children, the White Rabbit, the Knave of Hearts, and finally, the King and Queen of Hearts. Alice stands her ground when the Queen questions her. The Queen, prone to shouting ""Off with her head!"" orders the gardeners beheaded for painting the roses. Alice protects them by hiding them in a flower-pot. The Queen then invites Alice to play croquet.

The croquet game is chaotic: the ground is uneven, the balls are live hedgehogs, the mallets are live flamingoes, and the arches are doubled-up soldiers who constantly move. The Queen frequently shouts ""Off with his head!"" or ""Off with her head!"" Alice feels uneasy and looks for an escape. The Cheshire Cat's grin appears in the air, followed by its head. Alice complains to the Cat about the unfair game. The King, curious, asks Alice about the Cat. The Queen, without looking, orders the Cat's head removed. An argument ensues between the executioner, the King, and the Queen about how to behead a head without a body. Alice suggests asking the Duchess, who is in prison. As the executioner leaves to fetch the Duchess, the Cat's head fades away and disappears entirely.

The Duchess returns, linking arms with Alice and speaking affectionately, constantly finding morals in everything. The Queen reappears, angrily confronts the Duchess, and orders her to choose between leaving or losing her head. The Duchess immediately vanishes. The Queen then asks Alice if she has seen the Mock Turtle. Alice says no, so the Queen takes her to meet him, leaving Alice with a Gryphon. The Gryphon reveals that the Queen's execution threats are ""all her fancy"" and ""they never executes nobody.""

They find the Mock Turtle, who is sitting sadly and sighing. The Gryphon again states his sorrow is ""all his fancy."" The Mock Turtle, with tears, begins to tell his history, explaining he was once a ""real Turtle"" and went to school in the sea, learning ""Reeling and Writhing,"" ""Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, and Derision,"" and ""Drawling, Stretching, and Fainting in Coils."" He also mentions that lessons ""lessen"" from day to day. The Gryphon interrupts, suggesting they talk about games.

The Mock Turtle describes the ""Lobster Quadrille,"" a dance involving lobsters, swimming, and somersaults. He and the Gryphon demonstrate the first figure of the dance and the Mock Turtle sings a song about a whiting and a snail. They explain that whitings have their tails in their mouths because they were thrown out to sea, and that under the sea, shoes are made shiny with a ""whiting"" and are made of ""Soles and eels."" The Mock Turtle insists wise fish always go with a ""porpoise"" (mispronouncing ""purpose""). The Gryphon then asks Alice to tell her adventures. Alice recounts her experiences from that morning, including her size changes and her incorrect recitation of ""You are old, Father William"" to the Caterpillar. The Mock Turtle and Gryphon find her story curious and ask her to recite another poem. Alice recites a nonsensical version of ""’Tis the voice of the Lobster,"" which confuses her listeners. The Gryphon then suggests the Mock Turtle sing a song. The Mock Turtle sings a melancholy song called ""Turtle Soup.""

Suddenly, a cry of ""The trial’s beginning!"" is heard. The Gryphon takes Alice by the hand, and they hurry off to the trial.

They arrive to find the King and Queen of Hearts on their throne, with a crowd of creatures and cards. The Knave of Hearts is in chains, accused of stealing the Queen's tarts, which are displayed on a table. The White Rabbit acts as the Herald. The King is the judge, and twelve ""creatures"" (animals and birds) serve as the jury, busily writing on slates. Alice takes away Bill the Lizard's squeaking pencil. The White Rabbit reads the accusation.

The first witness is the Hatter, who gives rambling, nonsensical testimony about tea-time, conflicting dates, and the ""twinkling of the tea."" During his testimony, Alice begins to grow larger again, causing the Dormouse (who is also present) to complain and move away. The King threatens the Hatter with execution if he doesn't provide clearer evidence. The Hatter is dismissed, and the Queen orders his head off, but he escapes.

The second witness is the Duchess's Cook, who carries a pepper-box, causing everyone to sneeze. She refuses to give evidence. When cross-examined by the King, she states tarts are made of ""Pepper, mostly."" The Dormouse, speaking from behind her, interjects ""Treacle."" The Queen, enraged, orders the Dormouse to be beheaded and removed. In the ensuing confusion, the Cook disappears.

To Alice's surprise, the White Rabbit then calls ""Alice!"" as the next witness. Forgetting her size, Alice jumps up, tipping over the jury-box and spilling the jurymen. She hastily puts them back, ensuring Bill the Lizard is right-side up. The King asks Alice what she knows about the business, and she replies, ""Nothing whatever."" The King declares this ""very important,"" but the White Rabbit corrects him to ""Unimportant,"" which the King then adopts.

The King, consulting his notebook, reads ""Rule Forty-two: _All persons more than a mile high to leave the court_."" Everyone looks at Alice, who is now very large. Alice denies being a mile high, but the King and Queen insist she is. Alice refuses to leave, arguing the rule was just invented. The King, flustered, tells the jury to consider their verdict.

The White Rabbit interrupts, presenting a newly found paper—a set of unsigned, nonsensical verses, supposedly written by the prisoner. The King and Queen interpret the verses as proof of the Knave's guilt. Alice, now grown to her full size and unafraid, loudly declares there's ""not an atom of meaning in it."" The King attempts to find meaning in the verses, making a pun about the word ""fit"" and the Queen's ""fits.""

The King again calls for a verdict. The Queen, however, demands, ""Sentence first—verdict afterwards."" Alice calls this ""Stuff and nonsense!"" and refuses to hold her tongue when the Queen orders it. The Queen screams, ""Off with her head!"" Alice, at her full height, retorts, ""Who cares for you? You’re nothing but a pack of cards!""

At this, the entire pack of cards rises into the air and flies down upon her. Alice screams and tries to beat them off, and then finds herself lying on the riverbank, with her head in her sister's lap. Her sister wakes her, asking about her long sleep. Alice recounts her ""curious dream"" to her sister. Her sister, after listening, kisses her and tells her to go for tea. Alice runs off, thinking about her wonderful dream.

Alice's sister remains on the bank, leaning her head on her hand, and begins to dream herself, picturing Alice's adventures: the White Rabbit, the frightened Mouse, the tea-party with the March Hare and his friends, the Queen's shrill cries, the pig-baby, the Gryphon, the Lizard's pencil, the suppressed guinea-pigs, and the Mock Turtle's sobs. She imagines how these strange sounds would transform into the ordinary sounds of a farmyard if she were to open her eyes. Finally, she pictures Alice as a grown woman, sharing these strange tales with other children, keeping her childhood heart, and finding joy in their simple pleasures, remembering her own happy summer days."
Anna Karenina-Leo Tolstoy,"The provided text, ""Anna Karenina,"" details the intertwined lives of several characters, primarily focusing on the Oblonsky family, Konstantin Levin, and Anna Karenina herself, through a series of events, internal reflections, and social interactions.

**PART ONE**

The story begins in the **Oblonskys' house**, where ""everything was in confusion."" The wife, **Darya Alexandrovna (Dolly)**, has discovered her husband, **Prince Stepan Arkadyevitch Oblonsky (Stiva)**, is having an affair with their French governess. Dolly has declared she can no longer live with him, causing three days of painful tension for the entire household, including the children, governess, housekeeper, cook, and other staff.

Stepan Arkadyevitch wakes up in his study, not his wife's room, recalling a pleasant dream. He then remembers the ""hopelessness of his position"" and his own fault, particularly an ""idiotic smile"" he gave when Dolly confronted him with the incriminating letter. He despairs, wondering what to do. He admits to himself that he doesn't regret his infidelity, only failing to hide it. He feels sorry for his wife and children.

His valet, Matvey, brings him a telegram. Matvey, an old friend, hints at Stepan's financial difficulties and reveals that Stepan's sister, **Anna Arkadyevna**, will arrive tomorrow. Matvey believes Anna's arrival might bring about a reconciliation between Stepan and Dolly. Dolly, however, has already told Matvey she is leaving and Stepan can do as he likes. Matrona Philimonovna, the nurse, urges Stepan to beg Dolly's forgiveness for the children's sake, but Dolly refuses to see him.

Stepan, despite his unhappiness, feels physically at ease. He reads letters, including an ""unpleasant"" one about selling a forest on his wife's property, which is financially necessary but cannot be discussed with Dolly yet. He reads a liberal newspaper, aligning his views with the majority. His children, Grisha and Tanya, come to greet him. Tanya, his favorite, blushes when he asks about her mother, revealing her awareness of the quarrel. Stepan gives them sweets. He then attends to a petitioner, a widow, offering her advice and a note of recommendation. He contemplates speaking to Dolly but an inner voice tells him it's useless, as he cannot make her attractive again or himself less susceptible to love. He decides he must go to her anyway.

Dolly is in her bedroom, trying to sort her and the children's belongings to move to her mother's. She feels she must leave but knows it's impossible due to her love for Stepan and the practical difficulties of caring for five children alone. Stepan enters, timidly calling her name. His radiant health contrasts with her worn appearance, making her resent his ""disgusting good nature."" She asks what he wants. He tells her Anna is coming. Dolly refuses to see Anna and shrieks at him to ""Go away!"" Stepan is moved to tears by her despair. He begs forgiveness, offering to do ""anything"" for the children. Dolly calls him ""Stiva"" but recoils from his touch. She questions how they can live together after his affair with the governess, calling him ""loathsome"" and ""repulsive."" A child's cry softens her face. Dolly threatens to expose him to the servants and children as a ""scoundrel"" and leaves, slamming the door. Stepan is mortified by her ""vulgarly"" shouted words. He instructs Matvey to prepare a room for Anna. Dolly, alone, still wonders if Stepan has ended the affair, but feels reconciliation is impossible, and they are ""strangers forever."" She drowns her grief in daily duties.

Stepan Arkadyevitch holds a lucrative government post, obtained through his brother-in-law, **Alexey Alexandrovitch Karenin** (Anna's husband). He is well-liked in society and at work due to his good humor, liberalism, and indifference to business. At his office, he conducts a board meeting. His old friend, **Konstantin Dmitrievitch Levin**, arrives. Levin is a country gentleman, cattle-breeder, and sportsman, and brother of Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev. Levin is shy and irritable, having resigned from district council work, which he found ineffective or corrupt. He wants to know about the **Shtcherbatskys**, specifically **Kitty**, with whom he is in love. Stepan, knowing this, suggests they meet later after Levin sees Kitty at the Zoological Gardens, where she skates. Stepan sighs, admitting his own affairs are ""in a poor way.""

Levin has come to Moscow to propose to Kitty. He has long admired the Shtcherbatsky family. After two months of enchantment in Moscow, he decided he was unworthy of Kitty and returned to the country. He felt he had no definite career, unlike his successful contemporaries, and considered himself an ""ugly, good-natured man."" However, in the country, he realized his love for Kitty was not a passing passion and he couldn't live without her. He returned to Moscow determined to propose.

Levin stays with his half-brother, **Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev**, a well-known author. Sergey is engaged in a philosophical debate with a professor about psychological and physiological phenomena. Levin finds their discussion avoids the ""meaning of life and death."" He asks if existence is possible without a body, but his question is dismissed.

After the professor leaves, Sergey asks about Levin's farming and district council work. Levin explains his resignation, criticizing the councils. Sergey reveals their brother, **Nikolay**, a ruined and dissolute man, is in Moscow. Levin is horrified and wants to see him, despite Sergey's advice against it and Nikolay's note asking to be left alone. Levin decides to visit Nikolay later, but first goes to Oblonsky's office for news of the Shtcherbatskys, then to find Kitty.

At the Zoological Gardens, Levin sees Kitty skating. He is overwhelmed by her beauty and feels she is unapproachable. Kitty, recognizing him, smiles and suggests they skate together. Levin is ecstatic. As they skate, holding hands, she expresses confidence in him. He replies, ""And I have confidence in myself when you are leaning on me,"" then blushes. Her face loses its friendliness. She suggests he speak to Mlle. Linon, her old governess. Levin feels he has offended her. He speaks to Mlle. Linon, who reminds him of his old joke about the three sisters. When he returns to Kitty, her friendliness is ""deliberate composure."" He says his stay depends on her. She skates away. Levin is horrified. He sees Kitty and her mother leaving. The Princess stiffly invites him to their Thursday at-home. Kitty, softening her mother's coldness, says ""Good-bye till this evening."" Stepan Arkadyevitch arrives and takes Levin to dinner.

At the restaurant, Levin is uncomfortable. Stepan orders an elaborate meal. Levin criticizes city life, and Stepan calls him a ""savage."" Stepan reveals Kitty is in love with Vronsky, and her mother supports him. Stepan says his wife, Dolly, has a gift for ""foreseeing things"" and believes ""Kitty is certain to be your wife."" Levin is overjoyed, confessing his past ""sins"" and feeling unworthy. Stepan dismisses his sins.

Stepan then tells Levin that Vronsky is his rival, describing him as wealthy, handsome, and intelligent. Levin is angered, feeling his sacred feelings are ""profaned."" Stepan asks for advice on his own infidelity. Levin dismisses ""fallen women."" Stepan argues that life is not ""all of a piece."" Levin, absorbed in his own affairs, doesn't hear. They feel distant. Stepan leaves to talk to an aide-de-camp. Levin pays his expensive share of the bill and leaves to dress for the Shtcherbatskys'.

Kitty, eighteen, is a great success in society, with two serious suitors: Levin and Vronsky. The Princess prefers Vronsky, disliking Levin's shyness and country life. Vronsky is wealthy, clever, and aristocratic. The Princess is anxious about marrying off her daughters, noting changes in society where girls choose their own husbands. She fears Vronsky might only flirt. Kitty told her Vronsky awaits his mother's arrival before proposing. Levin's reappearance causes new anxiety for the Princess, fearing Kitty might refuse Vronsky out of honor. Kitty, returning home, asks her mother not to speak of it, though she desires what her mother desires.

Kitty feels the evening will be a turning point. She recalls Levin's tender love but finds the future with Vronsky ""brilliant happiness."" She enters the ballroom, feeling beautiful and confident. Levin arrives early, finding her alone. She realizes he has come to propose and she will have to ""wound"" him. She decides to tell the truth. Levin proposes, ""to be my wife!"" Kitty feels ecstasy, then remembers Vronsky, and hastily refuses him, ""That cannot be ... forgive me."" Levin says, ""It was bound to be so."" The Princess enters, relieved. Countess Nordston teases Levin. Vronsky arrives, greeting Kitty with ""tender light"" and a ""modestly triumphant smile."" Levin sees in Kitty's eyes that she loves Vronsky. Conversation turns to spiritualism, which Levin dismisses. Vronsky suggests table-turning. Kitty's eyes meet Levin's, expressing pity and happiness. Levin feels hatred. The old Prince embraces Levin, not noticing Vronsky. Levin leaves unnoticed, his last impression being Kitty's ""smiling, happy face"" answering Vronsky about the ball.

Kitty tells her mother about Levin's offer and her refusal, feeling she acted rightly but is haunted by Levin's ""dark dejection."" Her happiness is ""poisoned by doubts."" The Prince and Princess argue; the Prince blames the Princess for pushing Vronsky and praises Levin. The Princess is disturbed.

Vronsky, having no real home life, enjoyed the intimacy with Kitty. He didn't think his behavior was harmful and didn't consider marriage. He felt a stronger bond with Kitty after the evening and believed she loved him. He goes home and sleeps.

Next morning, Vronsky meets Oblonsky at the railway station. Oblonsky teases Vronsky about being in love. Vronsky asks whom Oblonsky is meeting, learning it's Anna Karenina. Vronsky has a vague, tedious recollection of her. Oblonsky tells Vronsky about Levin's proposal to Kitty and her likely refusal. Vronsky thinks Kitty could do better. A railway guard is crushed by a train. Anna is agitated, calling it an ""omen of evil."" Vronsky immediately gives 200 roubles for the widow. Anna asks about Vronsky and Kitty. Oblonsky says they hope Vronsky will marry Kitty. Anna leaves with Oblonsky, feeling the accident is an ""omen of evil.""

Vronsky, seeing Anna, is struck by her ""caressing and soft"" expression. He feels ""joyful pride."" He enters his mother's carriage. His mother, Countess Vronskaya, greets him and mentions Anna has an eight-year-old son and is fretting. She also implies Vronsky is having a ""perfect love affair."" Anna embraces her brother. Vronsky watches, smiling. Anna says good-bye to the Countess, who praises her. Anna gives Vronsky her hand, and he is delighted by her ""energetic squeeze."" Vronsky watches Anna leave, feeling annoyed she's talking eagerly about something not concerning him.

**PART TWO**

Kitty's health declines. Doctors suggest going abroad. The celebrated physician diagnoses ""nervous irritability"" and prescribes Soden waters. The family doctor suggests foreign travel to escape ""reminiscences."" Kitty, dazed with shame, feels her heart is ""broken."" She agrees to go abroad.

Dolly arrives, having just given birth and with a sick child. She is worried about Kitty. Her own life with Stepan is humiliating due to his infidelity and financial issues. The Prince blames the Princess for pushing Vronsky on Kitty, calling Vronsky a ""peacock"" and praising Levin. Kitty, hearing her father, bursts into tears, feeling he understands her shame. Dolly tells her mother Levin had intended to propose. Dolly goes to Kitty, who, in a ""passion,"" lashes out at Dolly for her ""sympathizing"" and for going back to a man who deceived her. Kitty then sobs, saying she is ""so, so wretched!"" They reconcile. Kitty confesses everything is ""hateful, loathsome, coarse"" to her. She insists on staying with Dolly to nurse the children through scarlatina. Kitty's health does not improve, and the Shtcherbatskys go abroad.

Anna, in Petersburg, now avoids her husband's official circle and Countess Lidia Ivanovna's intellectual set, finding them insincere. She gravitates to Princess Betsy Tverskaya's fashionable world, where she frequently meets Vronsky. She realizes Vronsky's pursuit is the ""whole interest of her life."" At the theater, Betsy teases Vronsky about being ""caught"" by Anna. Vronsky admits it. He tells Betsy he was mediating a scandal involving Petritsky and a government clerk.

Anna enters Betsy's drawing-room. She and Vronsky exchange glances. Anna tells Vronsky Kitty is very ill. She tells him he behaved ""wrongly"" with Kitty. Vronsky asks who was to blame. Anna, blushing, forbids him to speak of ""love."" She says ""this must end"" and asks him to go to Moscow to ask Kitty's forgiveness. Vronsky says she is ""all my life"" and he cannot find peace without her. He sees ""despair, of wretchedness ... or ... bliss."" She looks at him with love, but says they must be friends. He says they will never be friends. Alexey Alexandrovitch enters. Anna stays for supper. Vronsky escorts her out, murmuring ""love!"" Anna says the word ""means too much to me.""

Alexey Alexandrovitch, noticing the impropriety, decides to speak to Anna. He paces, feeling a ""chasm"" in his ""artificial life."" He plans a speech about public opinion, religious marriage, their son, and her unhappiness. Anna enters, feigning innocence. He warns her about her ""too animated conversation"" with Vronsky. Anna pretends to misunderstand. He coldly states she disregarded ""rules of decorum."" She tries to leave. He stops her, his face ""ugly and forbidding."" He says their union is from God and can only be severed by ""crime."" Anna feigns sleepiness. He says he loves her. Anna thinks he doesn't know what love is. He asks her to speak out if she feels any foundation for his words. She says she has nothing to say. He goes to bed. Anna lies awake, thinking of Vronsky with ""guilty delight."" She has a recurring nightmare of both men being her husbands.

Alexey Alexandrovitch and Anna's inner relations change, though outwardly they remain the same. He feels helpless against her ""amused perplexity."" He tries to talk to her but always uses a sarcastic tone.

Vronsky's desire for Anna is fulfilled. Anna, feeling ""sinful, so guilty,"" sinks to his feet, sobbing, begging forgiveness. Vronsky feels like a murderer. He covers her with kisses. She says, ""All is over; I have nothing but you."" She says ""Happiness!"" with ""horror and loathing."" She pushes him away, saying ""Not a word more."" She cannot express her complex feelings. She has a recurring nightmare about both men being her husbands.

Levin, three months after his rejection, still feels the pain. He learns his brother Nikolay is ill and goes to Moscow to persuade him to go abroad. Levin is working on a book about agriculture. Spring arrives, and Levin feels renewed. He goes to his farm, finds slovenliness, gets angry, then mows with the peasants, finding joy in the work. He dines with an old peasant, feeling closer to him than to his brother. He sees Ivan Parmenov and his wife, observing their ""freshly awakened love."" He feels envious of their ""laborious, pure, and socially delightful life."" He muses on his own life, deciding his old dreams were ""absurd."" He sees Kitty in a carriage, driving to Ergushovo. He realizes, ""I cannot go back to it. I love _her_.""

Levin asks Stepan about Kitty's illness. Stepan reveals she is ""very ill"" and doctors fear she may not live. Levin is shocked, but also pleased she is suffering. Stepan sells his forest to Ryabinin for a low price, which Levin criticizes as a ""fraud."" Levin argues about the impoverishment of the nobility and his own aristocratic values. Stepan says Vronsky is in Petersburg and Levin's rejection was his ""own fault."" Levin confesses his rejection.

Vronsky, after his fall and Anna's confession, feels ""disgraced, humiliated, guilty."" He feels his passion for Anna is stronger than ever. He considers suicide, takes a revolver, and shoots himself in the chest, but misses his heart. His brother's wife, Varya, nurses him.

Alexey Alexandrovitch, at Anna's sickbed, experiences ""spiritual peace"" from pity, remorse, and the ""joy of forgiveness."" He forgives Anna and Vronsky, and feels tenderness for the newborn baby, not his own. He is disturbed by society's expectations and Anna's fear of him. He overhears Betsy discussing Vronsky's suicide attempt. Anna, flushing, tells him Vronsky wants to say good-bye before going to Tashkend, and she refused to see him. Alexey Alexandrovitch is confused, unable to discuss it before Betsy. Betsy advises him to receive Vronsky. Alexey Alexandrovitch tells Anna she must decide.

Alexey Alexandrovitch goes to Anna, who is crying. He thanks her for her decision not to see Vronsky. Anna is irritated, wanting him to leave. She blames him for not letting her nurse the baby. She bursts into sobs, wishing she had died. Alexey Alexandrovitch decides their situation ""can’t go on like this."" He feels helpless against society's expectations.

Stepan Arkadyevitch meets Betsy, who says Alexey Alexandrovitch is ""killing her"" (Anna) and suggests divorce. Stepan agrees. He goes to Anna, who says she hates her husband for his ""virtues"" and cannot live with him. Stepan soothes her, suggesting divorce. Anna shakes her head, but her face brightens. Stepan offers to arrange it.

Stepan goes to Alexey Alexandrovitch, who gives him an unfinished letter to Anna, offering to forget the past and start a new life. Stepan suggests divorce. Alexey Alexandrovitch is averse, citing religious scruples, the illegitimacy of his son, and his desire to punish Anna. He feels divorce would ruin Anna. He says he will take the disgrace on himself, even give up his son. Stepan is touched. Alexey Alexandrovitch says he needs time to think.

Seryozha, Alexey Alexandrovitch's son, talks to the hall-porter about his father's new order. He struggles with his lessons, disbelieves in death, and prays for his mother to come for his birthday. Anna, having received a cruel refusal from Lidia Ivanovna to see Seryozha, decides to go to Alexey Alexandrovitch's house. She bribes the servants and enters Seryozha's room. He embraces her, saying he knew she would come. Anna is choked with tears. The servants try to prevent Alexey Alexandrovitch from meeting Anna. Anna tells Seryozha to love his father, saying ""he’s better and kinder than I am."" Alexey Alexandrovitch enters. Anna runs out, filled with ""repulsion and hatred"" for him. She leaves the toys she bought for Seryozha.

Anna returns to her hotel room, distraught. She feels her love for her baby daughter is not ""love"" compared to Seryozha. She looks at Seryozha's photograph, then Vronsky's, realizing he is the cause of her misery. She feels he is growing cold. She dresses with extra care. Yashvin and Vronsky arrive. Anna snatches Seryozha's photos from Vronsky. She invites Yashvin to dinner. She asks Vronsky if he has changed. He says his feelings cannot change, but he is cold.

Vronsky feels anger at Anna's willful refusal to understand her position. He thinks her public appearance is a ""challenge to society."" He returns to his rooms. Anna's valet announces she has gone to the theater. Vronsky goes to the theater, where he sees Madame Kartasova insult Anna. His mother also makes sarcastic remarks. Anna is distressed. She cries to Vronsky, ""You, you are to blame for everything!"" She tells him about her dream of dying in childbirth. They reconcile. Vronsky declines the Tashkend appointment and retires from the army. Anna and Vronsky go abroad without a divorce.

**PART THREE**

Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev visits his brother, Konstantin Levin, in the country. Levin is uncomfortable with Sergey's intellectualized view of country life and peasants, preferring his own practical, hands-on approach. Sergey criticizes Levin's lack of participation in public affairs. Levin argues that his personal interests don't align with these public duties.

Levin decides to mow with the peasants, finding joy and a sense of belonging in the physical labor. He has a deep conversation with an old peasant, Fokanitch, who says he lives ""for his soul, in truth, in God’s way."" This sparks a profound spiritual awakening in Levin. He realizes that true knowledge comes not from reason but from intuitive faith in goodness, a truth shared by all people. He feels a ""new and important"" thing has happened to him, giving his life ""positive meaning.""

Levin's brother Nikolay, who is dying of consumption, comes to stay with him. Levin is horrified by Nikolay's emaciated state but is also filled with pity. Nikolay, in his irritability, quarrels with Levin, accusing him of distorting communist ideas. Levin, in turn, is frustrated by Nikolay's cynicism and self-deception. Kitty joins Levin to nurse Nikolay, showing remarkable compassion and practical skill. She takes charge of his care, making him comfortable and persuading him to receive extreme unction. Nikolay temporarily rallies, but then declines rapidly. He dies, uttering ""Right!"" and ""O Lord!"" Levin is filled with horror at the enigma of death, but his wife's presence and the news of her pregnancy (a new mystery of life) save him from despair.

**PART FOUR**

Alexey Alexandrovitch, after Anna's confession, feels relief, like a tooth has been pulled. He decides Anna is a ""corrupt woman"" and focuses on extricating himself from the situation with ""propriety and comfort."" He considers dueling, divorce, and separation, but rejects them all due to his cowardice, fear of scandal, and unwillingness to see Anna free or to be blamed for her ruin. He decides to keep her with him, concealing the affair, breaking off the intrigue, and punishing her. He writes a letter to Anna, stating their life must go on as before and she must return to Petersburg. He finds religious justification for his decision.

Anna, after confessing to her husband, feels her position is ""false and dishonorable."" She regrets her words, fears disgrace, and the loss of Seryozha. She decides to take Seryozha and leave. She writes a letter to her husband, but tears it up, then rewrites it without an appeal to his generosity. She tries to write to Vronsky but finds it ""coarse.""

At the railway station, Sergey Ivanovitch and Katavasov see volunteers leaving for Servia. A princess tells Sergey Ivanovitch that Vronsky is also going by this train, taking a squadron at his own expense. Sergey Ivanovitch talks to Vronsky, who is grim and suffering, saying life is ""loathsome"" to him and he is going to meet death. Vronsky is still haunted by Anna's death.

She decides to end her life. She goes to the railway station, recalling the man crushed by the train when she first met Vronsky. She throws herself under a train, dying instantly.

Almost two months later, Sergey Ivanovitch reflects on the failure of his book and his new involvement in the Slavonic question. He and Katavasov travel to Levin's.

Levin is deeply affected by Anna's death. He struggles with his faith, but through his family, his work, and the simple faith of the peasants, he finds a new understanding of God and the meaning of life. He realizes that goodness is outside reason and that he must live for God, not for his own desires. He accepts that he will still struggle with his imperfections, but his life now has a ""positive meaning of goodness.""

The text concludes with Levin's internal realization that his new faith, though not changing him outwardly, has taken firm root in his soul, giving his life meaning and purpose. He will continue to live, work, and love, guided by this inner sense of goodness."
Crime and Punishment-Fyodor Dostoyevsky,"The story begins on a hot July evening as a young man, Raskolnikov, leaves his garret in S. Place, avoiding his landlady to whom he is deeply in debt. He is impoverished, irritable, and isolated, burdened by an unspoken ""thing"" he intends to attempt. He counts the 730 steps to a large house, planning a ""rehearsal"" for his project. He enters the building via a dark back staircase, noting that a German clerk is moving out, leaving only an old woman on the fourth floor.

Raskolnikov rings the bell of the old woman, Alyona Ivanovna, a diminutive, withered pawnbroker with sharp, malignant eyes. He introduces himself as a student and pawns an old silver watch, his father's. Alyona Ivanovna is a harsh businesswoman, offering only a rouble and a half for the watch and deducting interest in advance. Raskolnikov is angered but accepts, observing her keys and deducing one large, notched key is for a strong-box. As he leaves, he casually asks if her sister, Lizaveta, is always alone.

Overwhelmed by repulsion and agitation, Raskolnikov enters a tavern. There, he encounters a drunken, retired clerk named Marmeladov, who introduces himself and begins to confess his life story. Marmeladov reveals his extreme poverty and his wife, Katerina Ivanovna, an educated officer's daughter, who is now consumptive and works tirelessly to support their three small children. He admits to selling his wife's belongings for drink and recounts how, driven by desperation, Katerina Ivanovna pushed his daughter, Sonia, into prostitution. He describes Sonia's silent sacrifice of thirty roubles, her last money, and Katerina Ivanovna's subsequent remorse. Marmeladov recently regained a job but, five days prior, stole his remaining earnings from Katerina Ivanovna's box and has been drunk ever since, using Sonia's money for his current drink. He expresses self-pity and a belief in divine forgiveness.

Marmeladov asks Raskolnikov to escort him home. On the way, he expresses fear of his wife's anger, but more so of the children's hunger. They arrive at a squalid room where Katerina Ivanovna, emaciated and frantic, screams at Marmeladov, searches him for money, and, finding none, drags him by the hair and beats him. The children are terrified. Raskolnikov, disgusted, leaves some coppers on the window-sill and departs, reflecting on Sonia's fate and the ""percentage"" of people doomed to such lives. He questions his own ""hideous"" plan, wondering if humanity is inherently good.

The next day, Raskolnikov wakes late, irritable, and starving in his tiny, dirty room. Nastasya, his landlady's servant, brings him tea and soup and informs him that his landlady, Praskovya Pavlovna, plans to report him to the police for unpaid rent. Nastasya then delivers a letter from his mother. The letter details his sister Dounia's past humiliation as a governess in the Svidrigaïlov household, where Mr. Svidrigaïlov made inappropriate advances. Marfa Petrovna, Svidrigaïlov's wife, initially slandered Dounia but later publicly cleared her name after Svidrigaïlov provided proof of Dounia's innocence. Dounia has now accepted a marriage proposal from Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin, a wealthy, conceited man who explicitly stated his preference for a poor wife he could control. His mother and Dounia are coming to Petersburg for the wedding, hoping Luzhin will help Raskolnikov's career.

Raskolnikov is enraged by the letter, seeing Dounia's marriage as a sacrifice for his sake. He vows to prevent it, feeling that Marmeladov's question about having ""nowhere to turn"" resonates with his own desperate situation. His ""dream"" of committing a crime now seems menacingly real. He wanders aimlessly, then encounters a young, drunk girl on a bench, being preyed upon by a gentleman. Raskolnikov intervenes, giving a policeman twenty copecks to help the girl, but then instantly regrets it, feeling it's not his business. He then recalls he was going to see his friend Razumihin.

He decides not to go to Razumihin's until ""after It, when It will be over."" He falls asleep in Petrovsky Ostrov and has a nightmare about a peasant brutally beating a thin mare to death. He wakes in terror, realizing the dream's connection to his own plan to kill. He feels he cannot go through with it, but then overhears Lizaveta Ivanovna, the pawnbroker's sister, arranging to be away at seven o'clock the next day. This unexpected information solidifies his resolve, as it means Alyona Ivanovna will be alone.

The next morning, Raskolnikov checks his clothes for bloodstains, finding some on his trousers, which he cuts off. He realizes he still has the stolen purse and trinkets in his pockets and frantically hides them in a hole under the wallpaper. He also removes the axe-carrying loop he had sewn into his coat. He receives a summons to the police office for his debt to the landlady. At the police office, he is irritable but relieved to learn the summons is only for debt. He overhears the superintendent, Nikodim Fomitch, and assistant superintendent, Ilya Petrovitch, discussing the pawnbroker's murder, including the initial suspicion of Koch and Pestryakov, and the later accusation of a painter named Nikolay, who pawned some of the old woman's ear-rings and later tried to hang himself. Raskolnikov faints during this conversation.

Upon recovering, Raskolnikov rushes home, hides the stolen items under a large stone in a deserted courtyard, feeling a momentary triumph. He then goes to Razumihin's, who is surprised by his illness and disheveled appearance. Razumihin offers him translation work and money, but Raskolnikov refuses, wanting to be alone. He walks to the Neva, feels detached, and throws the twenty copecks he received earlier into the water, feeling he has ""cut himself off from everyone and from everything.""

He returns home and is woken by screams. He hears his landlady being beaten by Ilya Petrovitch on the stairs. Nastasya later tells him he imagined it, attributing it to ""the blood crying in his ears."" Raskolnikov falls ill with a fever, drifting in and out of consciousness for several days.

When he fully recovers, Razumihin is there, along with a messenger who delivers 35 roubles from his mother. Razumihin explains he has been caring for him, bringing the doctor Zossimov, and even paid off Raskolnikov's IOU to the landlady. Razumihin mentions that during his delirium, Raskolnikov raved about ""ear-rings and chains"" and his sock. Razumihin has also bought him new clothes.

Zossimov arrives, confirming Raskolnikov's illness is nervous and will pass. Razumihin invites Zossimov to his house-warming, mentioning that Porfiry Petrovitch and Zametov will be there. Razumihin passionately argues against the police's ""stupid"" investigation of the pawnbroker murder, insisting Nikolay is innocent due to psychological inconsistencies, and that the real murderer must have dropped the ear-rings and hidden.

Luzhin then arrives, dressed ostentatiously. He expresses regret at Raskolnikov's illness and mentions he has found cheap lodgings for Dounia and his mother. He discusses his ""modern ideas"" of self-interest and then slanders Raskolnikov, accusing him of giving money to Sonia, a ""young woman of notorious behaviour."" Raskolnikov, enraged, threatens Luzhin and orders him to leave. Luzhin departs, offended. Zossimov and Razumihin discuss Raskolnikov's strange behavior, with Zossimov suspecting a ""fixed idea.""

Alone again, Raskolnikov feels a strange calm and determination to ""end it all to-day."" He wanders to the Hay Market, then to a restaurant, where he reads old newspapers about the murder. Zametov, the head clerk, joins him. Raskolnikov, in a fit of nervous bravado, implies his guilt, describing how a clever criminal would hide stolen goods under a stone (exactly what he did). He then directly asks Zametov, ""And what if it was I who murdered the old woman and Lizaveta?"" Zametov is stunned. Raskolnikov, triumphant, shows Zametov the money and new clothes, suggesting they are from the robbery.

Outside, Razumihin confronts him, furious about his escape from bed. Raskolnikov dismisses him, saying he wants to be alone. He then walks to a bridge, sees a woman drown herself, and feels a profound disgust. Drawn by an ""unaccountable prompting,"" he returns to the old woman's house, finds it being redecorated, and asks the workmen about bloodstains. He reveals his name and address to the porters and workmen, telling them to go to the police station for more information. He then goes to the police office.

At the police office, he finds Ilya Petrovitch. Ilya Petrovitch, in a good mood, talks about Raskolnikov's literary talent. Then, someone mentions that Svidrigaïlov has shot himself. Raskolnikov is shocked. He leaves the office, finds Sonia waiting for him, and tells her he has decided to confess. He complains about the humiliation but accepts a cypress wood cross from her, while she takes Lizaveta's copper cross. He then returns to Ilya Petrovitch and confesses: ""It was I killed the old pawnbroker woman and her sister Lizaveta with an axe and robbed them.""

**EPILOGUE:**
Raskolnikov is sentenced to eight years of penal servitude in Siberia. During his trial, he confesses all details of the crime, including the hidden items under the stone. The court, struck by his failure to use the money and his lack of memory about the trinkets, concludes the crime was due to ""temporary mental derangement."" Raskolnikov, however, insists his motive was poverty and a desire to provide for his life, and his confession was due to ""heartfelt repentance."" Extenuating circumstances, such as his past good deeds (helping a student, saving children from a fire), lead to a merciful sentence.

During the trial, Raskolnikov's mother, Pulcheria Alexandrovna, falls ill with a nervous disorder. Dounia and Razumihin create a false story about Raskolnikov's business trip, but his mother seems to suspect the truth, believing he has powerful enemies and will become a great statesman. Her mental state deteriorates, and she dies of brain fever within a fortnight, having revealed in her delirium that she knew more about his terrible fate.

Two months after Raskolnikov's confession, Dounia marries Razumihin. They plan to move to Siberia in five years to be with Raskolnikov. Sonia, using money from Svidrigaïlov (who had overheard Raskolnikov's confession and provided for Katerina Ivanovna's children before committing suicide), prepares to follow Raskolnikov to Siberia.

In prison, Raskolnikov is not crushed by the physical hardships, but by his wounded pride. He still believes his theory of ""extraordinary"" men was not stupid, only that he failed. He questions why he didn't kill himself, attributing his survival to instinct. He feels isolated from his fellow prisoners, who despise him for being a ""gentleman"" and an ""infidel."" Sonia, however, is loved and respected by all the convicts, who call her ""little mother.""

Raskolnikov falls ill again and has a dream of a terrible plague that drives people mad and to violence, with only a few chosen to survive. After recovering, he notices he anxiously awaits Sonia's visits. One day, at work on the river bank, Sonia appears. Raskolnikov, overcome, falls at her feet, weeping and embracing her knees. Sonia understands his love, and a light of infinite happiness comes into her eyes. They are both pale and thin, but filled with the ""dawn of a new future."" They resolve to wait out his seven-year sentence together. Raskolnikov feels a transformation, his crime and imprisonment now seeming ""an external, strange fact."" He takes Sonia's New Testament, wondering if her convictions can now be his. The story concludes, marking this as the beginning of his gradual renewal and regeneration."
Death in Venice-Thomas Mann,"Gustav Aschenbach, a renowned writer in his fifties, felt overwrought after a morning of intense work in Munich. Unable to find his usual midday rest, he went for a long walk in the English Gardens. As evening approached, feeling tired and sensing a storm, he waited for a tram at the North Cemetery. There, he observed a man with an unusual, almost savage appearance in the portico of the Funeral Hall. This encounter sparked in Aschenbach a sudden, intense desire for travel, a ""roving unrest"" and ""youthful longing"" for far-off places, culminating in a vivid hallucination of a tropical swampland. This urge to escape his demanding, disciplined work, which had become a ""coldly passionate service"" and was currently stalled by ""scruples of aversion,"" led him to decide on a three-to-four-week trip to a pleasant resort in the South.

Aschenbach, known for his rigorous, disciplined life and his works like the epic on Frederick of Prussia and ""The Wretch,"" had always channeled his frail constitution into sustained artistic effort, seeking dignity and a ""new hero-type"" that overcame weakness. His style had evolved from youthful skepticism to a classical, formal mastery. He had been knighted on his fiftieth birthday and lived a respectable life in Munich after his wife's death, with a married daughter.

Two weeks after his decision, Aschenbach departed. He first traveled by train to Trieste, then by ship to an Adriatic island. However, the island's rainy weather, provincial atmosphere, and lack of a sandy beach irritated him, making him realize it wasn't the place he sought. He abruptly decided to go to Venice, boarding a decrepit Italian ship. Onboard, he encountered a dirty, hunchbacked sailor and a theatrical ticket seller. He also observed a group of young people, among whom was an old man disguised as a youth with paint, a wig, and false teeth, which filled Aschenbach with a sense of ""dream-like estrangement.""

Upon arriving in Venice, the ship had to wait for the health department's barque. Aschenbach again saw the old man, now painfully drunk and making repulsive, suggestive gestures, further intensifying his feeling of the world distorting into the grotesque. After disembarking, Aschenbach requested a gondola to take him to the Lido. The gondolier, a brutal-looking, unlicensed man, instead began rowing him towards the open sea. Despite Aschenbach's protests, the gondolier insisted on taking him to the Lido, claiming the public steamboat wouldn't carry luggage. Aschenbach, feeling a strange ""poison of inertia,"" passively allowed the gondolier to continue, even considering the possibility of being in a criminal's hands. After being serenaded by musical brigands, they arrived at a dock. Aschenbach went to get change, and upon his return, the gondola and gondolier had vanished. An old man at the dock informed him the gondolier was unlicensed and he had ridden for free.

Aschenbach proceeded to a beach hotel on the Lido. That evening, in the hotel lobby, he noticed a Polish family: three severely dressed girls and a boy of about fourteen. He was captivated by the boy's ""absolutely beautiful"" face, which reminded him of Greek sculpture. The boy, Tadzio, with his honey-colored hair and luxurious sailor suit, seemed a pampered favorite, contrasting with his sisters' strict upbringing. Tadzio's ""strange dusky eyes"" met Aschenbach's as the family went to dinner, leaving Aschenbach ""peculiarly touched.""

The next day, the dreary weather and the foul smell of the lagoon depressed Aschenbach, making him consider leaving, recalling a previous illness in Venice. However, at breakfast, Tadzio appeared, displaying a ""godlike beauty"" that ""astonished, terrified even"" Aschenbach. On the beach, Aschenbach decided to stay, thinking ""Where would things be better?"" He observed Tadzio's playful activities and noted a moment of ""scorn and detestation"" on the boy's face when he passed a Russian family. Aschenbach, ""cheered and unstrung,"" learned the boy's name was Tadzio. He watched Tadzio bathe, emerging from the sea like a ""frail god,"" a spectacle that evoked a ""sense of myth."" Aschenbach felt a ""paternal affection"" for him.

Later, in the hotel lift, Aschenbach saw Tadzio close up and noticed his teeth were ""jagged and pale,"" suggesting he was ""very frail, he is sickly"" and ""will not grow old,"" a notion that brought Aschenbach a ""gratification or reassurance."" That afternoon, a walk through the sultry, crowded, and smelly streets of Venice made Aschenbach feel unwell, confirming his decision to leave. He announced his departure for the next morning. However, the following morning, he felt regret and irritation at being rushed by the hotel staff. As he was about to leave, Tadzio entered the buffet-room, and their eyes met again. Aschenbach silently bid him farewell.

On the steamboat, returning to the station, Aschenbach felt an ""exquisitely painful"" attachment to Venice, realizing his decision to leave was hasty and filled with ""misery"" and ""spiritual hunger."" At the station, he was in conflict about leaving. Then, a ""mishap"" occurred: his large trunk was mistakenly sent to Como. Aschenbach, seized by ""adventurous delight"" and ""unbelievable hilarity,"" declared he would not travel without his trunk and decided to return to the beach hotel to wait for it. Twenty minutes after arriving at the station, he was back on the Grand Canal, returning to the Lido, feeling like a ""truant boy."" Back in an almost identical room, he saw Tadzio returning from the sea and realized ""it was Tadzio who had made it so difficult for him to leave."" He then made a ""spontaneous act of welcome, of calm acceptance.""

Aschenbach decided to remain indefinitely at the Lido, enjoying the comfortable rhythm of life and the constant presence of Tadzio. He frequently observed the boy on the beach, admiring his ""godlike sculpture"" and feeling a ""drunkenness"" and ""enthusiasm"" that connected to ancient philosophical ideas about beauty as the path to the spiritual. Inspired, he began to write again, making his style emulate Tadzio's beauty. One morning, he tried to approach Tadzio for a casual acquaintance but was overcome by a pounding heart and shortness of breath, forcing him to pass by with bowed head, realizing his ""intoxication was too precious"" for ""soberness."" He stopped thinking of going home, his only concern being Tadzio's possible departure. He began to experience mythical dreams, seeing Tadzio as Hyacinth, loved by gods and doomed. An unspoken familiarity grew between Aschenbach and Tadzio, with the boy often walking past Aschenbach's spot and sometimes meeting his gaze. One evening, Tadzio smiled at Aschenbach, an ""eloquent, familiar, charming"" smile like Narcissus. Overwhelmed, Aschenbach retreated to the park and whispered, ""I love you!""

During his fourth week, Aschenbach noticed a decrease in hotel guests and overheard the barber mention a ""plague."" In Venice, he detected a ""peculiar odour"" of sickness and disinfectant, and saw euphemistic posters warning against gastric diseases. He learned from newspapers that authorities were denying plague rumors to protect the city's economy. Aschenbach felt a ""dark contentment"" with this ""wicked secret,"" as it ensured Tadzio's continued presence. He began to stalk Tadzio, following him through Venice's labyrinthine streets, even bribing a gondolier to pursue Tadzio's boat. His infatuation led him to stop at Tadzio's room door one night, leaning his head against it ""in utter drunkenness."" He rationalized his forbidden passion, connecting it to the heroism and divine acceptance of Eros in antiquity.

Driven to get reliable news, Aschenbach confronted an English clerk at a travel bureau, who revealed the truth: an Indian cholera epidemic was raging in Venice, kept secret by authorities. The disease was deadly, with 80% fatality. The clerk advised Aschenbach to leave immediately. Aschenbach, ""feverishly excited, triumphant in his possession of the truth,"" considered warning Tadzio's mother but ultimately decided against it, whispering, ""I will keep silent!"" He felt intoxicated by his ""share in the facts and the guilt,"" finding ""egregious sweetness"" in the chaos, and chose to remain.

That night, he had a terrifying, Dionysian dream of a raging mob, an orgy of ""unchastity and fury of decay,"" dominated by the ""deep coaxing flute"" and the ""sweet and savage"" word ""Tadziu."" He awoke ""unnerved, shattered, and hopelessly under the power of the demon."" He no longer cared about being observed. As guests fled the city, Tadzio and his family remained. Aschenbach, wanting to please, attempted to rejuvenate his appearance. He visited the hotel barber, who dyed his hair black, curled it, and applied cosmetics to his face, making him look younger. The barber remarked, ""Now the gentleman can fall in love unhesitatingly.""

A storm wind rose, bringing rain and the smell of rotting things. Aschenbach, tracking Tadzio through the diseased city, became disoriented. Tadzio, aware of being followed, occasionally looked back at Aschenbach, not betraying him. Aschenbach, ""drunk with the knowledge of this,"" eventually lost sight of Tadzio. Exhausted and thirsty, he bought and ate overly ripe strawberries. He rested on the steps of a cistern in a quiet square, reflecting on his past dignity as an artist and his current state. In a half-slumbering state, he had a philosophical monologue, concluding that the artist's path through beauty and the senses, guided by Eros, is ""perilous,"" ""wrong and sinful,"" leading to ""intoxication and to desire,"" and ultimately to the ""precipice.""

A few days later, feeling unwell with vertigo and malaise, Aschenbach learned that the Polish family was leaving after lunch. He went to the beach, which now had an ""air of autumn."" Tadzio was playing with a few remaining companions. One boy, Jaschu, threw sand in Tadzio's face and then wrestled him, pinning him down and nearly suffocating him. Aschenbach, enraged, was about to intervene when Jaschu released Tadzio. Tadzio, pale and disheveled, slowly walked away from his companions towards the water and onto a sand-bank, separating himself from everyone. He stopped, turned, and looked over his shoulder towards the shore. Aschenbach, watching, felt as though Tadzio was smiling and signaling him to ""come out,"" guiding him towards ""egregious promises."" Aschenbach stood up to follow him. Minutes later, he collapsed in his chair. He was brought to his room. On the same day, the world received news of his death."
Don Quixote-Miguel de Cervantes,"This detailed summary is based solely on the provided text, without incorporating any external knowledge of the book.

**The Plot of Don Quixote**

The story begins in a village in La Mancha, where a gentleman, nearly fifty years old, lives with his housekeeper, niece, and a lad. He dedicates all his leisure time to reading books of chivalry with such passion that he neglects his property, even selling land to acquire more books. His favorite authors include Feliciano de Silva. Through excessive reading and little sleep, his brains dry up, and he loses his wits, believing all the fantastic tales of knights-errant, enchantments, and battles to be true.

Driven by this delusion, he decides to become a knight-errant himself, roaming the world to right wrongs, redress grievances, and achieve eternal fame. He envisions himself becoming an emperor. His first step is to clean his great-grandfather's rusty armor. Finding it lacks a closed helmet, he fashions a pasteboard one, which he tests with his sword, breaking it. He then reinforces it with iron bars and deems it perfect. He spends four days naming his lean hack ""Rocinante,"" signifying its new status. He then names himself ""Don Quixote,"" adding ""of La Mancha"" to honor his country. Finally, he realizes he needs a lady to love, choosing a farm-girl named Aldonza Lorenzo, whom he renames ""Dulcinea del Toboso.""

One morning, Don Quixote secretly sallies forth on Rocinante. He soon realizes he has not been dubbed a knight, a necessary step according to chivalric law. He resolves to be knighted by the first person he encounters. He travels all day without incident, which disappoints him. Towards nightfall, he spots an inn, which he mistakes for a castle. At the door, he sees two young women, whom he perceives as fair maidens or ladies. A swineherd's horn blast, intended for pigs, is interpreted by Don Quixote as a dwarf announcing his arrival. He courteously addresses the women, who laugh at his appearance and language. The innkeeper, amused but wary, offers him lodging. Don Quixote, believing the innkeeper to be the castle's castellan, accepts. The women help remove his armor, but he refuses to take off his makeshift helmet, which is tied with ribbons. He quotes a ballad, revealing his name and Rocinante's. For supper, he is served stockfish, which he calls ""troutlets,"" and eats with difficulty due to his helmet, requiring one of the women to feed him. He drinks wine through a reed. A sowgelder's pipe blast further reinforces his delusion that he is in a grand castle. Still, he is distressed by not being a knight.

To remedy this, Don Quixote kneels before the innkeeper, begging to be dubbed a knight and to watch his arms in the ""castle chapel."" The innkeeper, realizing his guest's madness, plays along. He tells Don Quixote there is no chapel, but he can watch his arms in the courtyard. He also advises Don Quixote to carry money, clean shirts, and ointment, as true knights-errant do, though histories omit it. Don Quixote agrees and places his armor on a trough by a well. As he guards his armor, a carrier attempts to water his mules, needing to move the armor. Don Quixote warns him, then strikes him with his lance, knocking him senseless. He resumes his watch. Another carrier approaches, and Don Quixote strikes him too. The inn's inhabitants rush out, and the carriers begin stoning Don Quixote. The innkeeper intervenes, explaining Don Quixote is mad. Don Quixote, calling on Dulcinea, stands firm. The innkeeper, wanting to resolve the situation, performs a burlesque knighting ceremony, using his account-book as a ritual text. He strikes Don Quixote on the neck and shoulder. The two inn girls, La Tolosa and La Molinera, gird his sword and buckle his spur, and Don Quixote renames them ""Doña Tolosa"" and ""Doña Molinera."" Don Quixote, now ""knighted,"" embraces the innkeeper and rides off.

Don Quixote, elated, decides to return home to gather money, shirts, and a squire. He plans to recruit a farm-laborer neighbor. On his way, he hears cries and finds a youth, Andres, being flogged by his master, a farmer named Juan Haldudo. Don Quixote intervenes, ordering the farmer to pay Andres his overdue wages. The farmer promises to pay Andres at home, swearing by the order of knighthood. Don Quixote, believing him, rides off. However, the farmer immediately ties Andres up again and flogs him more severely, mocking Don Quixote. Andres vows to find Don Quixote and report the betrayal. Don Quixote, unaware, congratulates himself. He then encounters a party of Toledo traders, whom he mistakes for knights-errant, and demands they confess Dulcinea's unparalleled beauty. One trader's sarcastic reply enrages Don Quixote, who charges. Rocinante stumbles, throwing Don Quixote. A muleteer beats him severely with a piece of his broken lance. Don Quixote lies battered, believing it a knightly mishap.

Unable to move, Don Quixote recalls chivalric tales of wounded knights. A peasant from his village, Pedro Alonso, finds him. Don Quixote, in his delusion, mistakes Pedro for the Marquis of Mantua and recites ballads. Pedro, recognizing ""Señor Quixada,"" helps him onto his ass and ties Don Quixote's armor onto Rocinante. On the way home, Don Quixote continues his mad ramblings, now believing he is the Moor Abindarraez. Pedro realizes his neighbor is mad and hurries. At Don Quixote's house, the housekeeper, niece, curate, and barber are worried. They blame his books and resolve to burn them. Don Quixote is put to bed, claiming his bruises are from fighting ten giants.

The next day, the curate and barber inspect Don Quixote's library. They burn most of his chivalric romances, sparing ""Amadis of Gaul,"" ""Palmerin of England,"" ""Tirante el Blanco,"" and some poetry. They wall up the book room, telling Don Quixote a magician named Friston carried them off. Don Quixote believes Friston is his enemy, trying to thwart his future glory. He then persuades Sancho Panza, a farm laborer, to become his squire, promising him an island to govern. Sancho, excited by the prospect, leaves his family. Don Quixote sells some property for money. They depart secretly at night, Sancho on Dapple, dreaming of his future kingdom.

They encounter windmills, which Don Quixote believes are giants. He charges, his lance breaks, and he and Rocinante fall. Sancho helps him, but Don Quixote attributes the transformation to Friston. He resolves to make a new lance. Later, they encounter two friars and a coach. Don Quixote, believing the friars are abducting a princess, attacks them. He unhorses one friar, and the other flees. Sancho attempts to strip the fallen friar, but the muleteers beat Sancho severely. Don Quixote then demands the lady in the coach go to El Toboso to present herself to Dulcinea. A Biscayan squire challenges Don Quixote. They duel fiercely. Don Quixote, calling on Dulcinea, strikes the Biscayan. The fight is interrupted, and the story breaks off. A later narrator finds the continuation in Arabic manuscripts. The duel concludes with Don Quixote severely wounding the Biscayan, who yields and promises to go to El Toboso.

Sancho, recovered, asks for his promised island. Don Quixote explains this was a crossroads adventure, not an island one, but promises future rewards. Sancho suggests they flee from the Holy Brotherhood, but Don Quixote assures him of his protection. Don Quixote, having lost part of his ear, mentions the Balsam of Fierabras, which can cure any wound. Sancho is eager for the recipe. Don Quixote, seeing his helmet shattered, swears an oath not to eat from a tablecloth or embrace his wife until he finds a new helmet. Sancho objects to the oath's impracticality. They eat Sancho's rustic provisions. They spend the night near goatherds, where Don Quixote delivers a long discourse on the Golden Age and the necessity of knight-errantry. A goatherd sings a love ballad.

The next day, a goatherd tells them about Chrysostom, a student-shepherd who died of love for Marcela, a beautiful but scornful shepherdess. Chrysostom's will directs his burial in the fields where he first saw Marcela. Don Quixote resolves to attend. At the burial, Marcela appears and defends her right to remain free and not be blamed for her lovers' despair. Don Quixote, impressed, declares no one should follow her. The papers of Chrysostom are burned, except those taken by a traveler, Vivaldo, who reads Chrysostom's ""Lay of Despair.""

Don Quixote and Sancho search for Marcela without success. They rest in a glade. Rocinante attempts to mate with some mares, leading to a beating from Yanguesan carriers. Don Quixote and Sancho fight the carriers and are severely beaten. Don Quixote blames himself for fighting non-knights. Sancho, in pain, wants to go home. Don Quixote, having lost several teeth, decides to use Dapple to carry him to an inn, which he again mistakes for a castle. At the inn, Don Quixote is tended by the hostess, her daughter, and the Asturian servant, Maritornes. Don Quixote, in his delusion, believes the innkeeper's daughter is in love with him. Maritornes, going to meet a carrier, accidentally encounters Don Quixote, who declares his fidelity to Dulcinea. The jealous carrier attacks Don Quixote, and a general brawl ensues in the dark. An officer of the Holy Brotherhood intervenes. Don Quixote is beaten and injured. He prepares the Balsam of Fierabras, which cures him but makes Sancho violently ill. Don Quixote, refusing to pay, rides off. Sancho is then blanketed by the inn's guests. He escapes, but his alforjas are confiscated.

Sancho, bruised, complains about the ""enchanted"" inn. Don Quixote attributes everything to enchanters. Sancho suggests they return home, but Don Quixote insists on continuing. Don Quixote mistakes flocks of sheep for two armies and charges them, killing several. The shepherds stone him, breaking his balsam flask and knocking out more teeth. Don Quixote blames Friston for transforming the armies into sheep. Sancho, disgusted, vomits on Don Quixote after his master vomits from the balsam. Sancho realizes his alforjas are gone and considers abandoning his master. Don Quixote consoles him, saying good fortune follows bad.

They encounter a procession of ""encamisados"" (men in white shrouds) carrying a bier. Don Quixote, believing it's an abducted lady, attacks them, wounding a bachelor. Sancho loots a mule. Don Quixote, calling himself ""the Knight of the Rueful Countenance,"" learns the bachelor is a churchman and has broken his leg. The bachelor excommunicates Don Quixote. Sancho, seeing his master's ill-favored face, suggests the name ""Knight of the Rueful Countenance."" They eat the stolen provisions.

They hear strange noises and Don Quixote believes it's a perilous adventure. He prepares to descend into a cave, telling Sancho to wait three days and report his death to Dulcinea. Sancho, fearing for his master, ties Rocinante's legs, forcing Don Quixote to wait until dawn. Sancho tells a rambling story, but Don Quixote loses count of the details, ending it. At dawn, they discover the noises came from fulling mills. Don Quixote is mortified, but Sancho laughs, earning him two blows from his master's pike. Don Quixote explains that enchanters make things appear differently.

They meet a barber wearing his brass basin as a helmet. Don Quixote, believing it's Mambrino's helmet, charges and unhorses him. He claims the basin as his prize. Sancho, recognizing it as a basin, is confused. Don Quixote explains it's an enchanted helmet. Sancho swaps Dapple's old trappings for the barber's new ones. Sancho suggests they serve a great prince, but Don Quixote insists on roaming for fame.

They arrive at the duke and duchess's castle, where they are received with great pomp, as the duke and duchess have read the first part of Don Quixote's history and plan to amuse themselves with his madness. Don Quixote is bathed and dressed. At dinner, Sancho tells a long, rambling story about seating, irritating an ecclesiastic. Don Quixote defends knight-errantry, leading the ecclesiastic to leave in anger. Don Quixote then undergoes a ""washing ceremony"" by damsels, which he finds strange. Sancho desires the same. The duchess asks Don Quixote to describe Dulcinea, but he says she is enchanted into a peasant. Sancho confirms this, adding details about her ""garlic smell."" Kitchen boys attempt to ""wash"" Sancho with dishwater, but he resists fiercely.

The duchess asks Sancho about Dulcinea's enchantment. Sancho confesses he invented it to deceive his master. The duchess, however, insists Dulcinea is truly enchanted, and Sancho is the one deceived. Sancho accepts this. He recounts his adventure in the cave of Montesinos. The duke and duchess plan a hunting party. During the hunt, a boar appears. Sancho, terrified, climbs a tree and gets stuck. The boar is killed. Later, the wood is set ablaze, and military sounds fill the air. A demon courier announces that Montesinos is bringing the enchanted Dulcinea, and that Sancho must receive 3,300 lashes to disenchant her. A triumphal car appears with Merlin and a nymph (Altisidora). Merlin confirms the lashes are required. Sancho vehemently refuses. Altisidora, revealing her beauty, pleads with him. Sancho, after much argument, agrees to the lashes on his own terms. Clavileño, a wooden horse, appears. Don Quixote and Sancho are blindfolded and mount it. The duke's servants simulate a flight through the air with bellows and fire. Clavileño explodes, throwing them to the ground. A placard declares the duennas shaved and Clavijo and Antonomasia restored, and Dulcinea will be disenchanted when Sancho completes his lashes. Sancho is disappointed the duennas vanished before he saw their shaved faces.

Don Quixote, still at the castle, is visited by Doña Rodriguez, a duenna, who complains that a rich farmer's son seduced her daughter and refuses to marry her. Don Quixote promises to challenge the youth. The duke arranges a combat. On the day of the battle, the lacquey Tosilos, disguised as a knight, falls in love with Doña Rodriguez's daughter and yields to Don Quixote, offering to marry her. Doña Rodriguez and her daughter are furious, realizing the trick. Don Quixote attributes it to enchantment. The marriage is postponed.

Don Quixote decides to leave the castle. Sancho receives 200 gold crowns from the majordomo. Altisidora sings a lament, accusing Don Quixote of stealing her kerchiefs and garters. Sancho admits to the kerchiefs. Don Quixote denies theft and attributes Altisidora's passion to idleness. They depart for Saragossa.

On the road, they encounter laborers carrying images of saints. Don Quixote interprets them as knights-errant. He then encounters a drove of bulls, which trample him and Sancho. They rest by a spring. Don Quixote, dejected, proposes they become shepherds for his year of retirement. Sancho is enthusiastic, suggesting names for their pastoral personas. That night, a drove of pigs tramples them. Don Quixote attributes this to divine punishment.

They reach an inn. Don Quixote overhears two gentlemen reading a false ""Second Part of Don Quixote,"" which claims he has forgotten Dulcinea and that Sancho's wife is Mari Gutierrez. Don Quixote is enraged and confronts them, asserting his constancy and the true identity of Sancho's wife (Teresa Panza). He decides to go to Barcelona instead of Saragossa to expose the false author.

On the way to Barcelona, Don Quixote tries to force Sancho to complete his lashes, but Sancho resists and trips him. They are then surrounded by robbers led by Roque Guinart. Roque, impressed by Don Quixote, releases them and returns Sancho's stolen items. A woman, Claudia Jeronima, arrives, having shot her lover, Don Vicente Torrellas, for betraying her. Roque and Claudia find Don Vicente dying. He denies betrayal and offers to marry her. Claudia faints, and Don Vicente dies. Claudia resolves to become a nun. Roque returns to his men, distributes spoils, and sends a letter to a friend in Barcelona announcing Don Quixote's arrival.

They enter Barcelona, where Don Antonio Moreno welcomes Don Quixote. Boys play a prank, putting furze under Rocinante's and Dapple's tails, causing them to throw their riders. Don Quixote is housed in Don Antonio's stately home. Don Antonio devises harmless pranks. He displays Don Quixote on a balcony with a placard on his back identifying him. Later, he shows Don Quixote an ""enchanted head"" that answers questions (a trick with a student in a hidden room). Don Quixote asks about Montesinos's cave and Dulcinea's disenchantment; the head gives ambiguous answers. Don Quixote then visits a printing office and discovers the false ""Second Part"" of his history.

Don Quixote and Sancho visit the galleys. Sancho is subjected to a ""whirling"" ceremony by the crew. A corsair brigantine is captured. A beautiful youth on board reveals herself to be Ana Felix, a Christian Morisco, and her companion Don Gregorio, disguised as a woman, is still in Algiers. Her father, Ricote (Sancho's neighbor from his government days), is also found among the pilgrims. A plan is made to rescue Don Gregorio.

On the beach, Don Quixote is challenged by the Knight of the White Moon. The condition is that if Don Quixote is vanquished, he must return home for a year and abstain from arms. Don Quixote accepts. They charge, and the Knight of the White Moon unhorses Don Quixote. Don Quixote, bruised, confesses Dulcinea's beauty and agrees to the terms. The Knight of the White Moon is revealed to be Samson Carrasco, the bachelor, who orchestrated this to force Don Quixote home for a cure. Don Quixote is carried back to the city.

Sancho tries to comfort Don Quixote, who is dejected by his defeat. Don Gregorio is rescued from Algiers. Ricote and Ana Felix are reunited. Don Antonio offers to help them stay in Spain. Don Quixote and Sancho depart for their village. Don Quixote laments his defeat. Sancho offers comfort and suggests they hang up his armor. Don Quixote agrees. They encounter a wager about a footrace, which Sancho judges. They meet Tosilos, the lacquey, who tells them Doña Rodriguez's daughter became a nun.

Don Quixote proposes they become shepherds for his year of retirement. Sancho is enthusiastic, but also expresses concerns about the dangers and his daughter's safety. That night, a drove of pigs tramples them. Don Quixote attributes this to divine punishment.

Finally, Don Quixote and Sancho reach their village. At the entrance, Don Quixote interprets some boys' words and a hare's flight as bad omens for Dulcinea. Sancho buys a cricket cage to break the omens. They meet the curate and bachelor. Sancho is still wearing the flaming robe, and Dapple the mitre. Teresa Panza, Sancho's wife, runs out, disappointed by his un-governor-like appearance. Sancho assures her he brings money. Don Quixote privately tells the curate and bachelor of his defeat and his shepherd plan. They agree, hoping it will cure him. The housekeeper and niece object, but Don Quixote dismisses their concerns.

Don Quixote falls ill with a fever. For six days, his friends and Sancho attend him. The doctor advises him to attend to his soul. After a long sleep, Don Quixote wakes up, completely sane. He denounces books of chivalry as absurdities and deceptions, regretting his madness. He declares his true name is Alonso Quixano the Good. His friends are astonished. Don Quixote asks for a confessor and a notary. He makes his will, forgiving Sancho any debts and leaving his property to his niece, Antonia Quixana, with the condition that she marry a man who knows nothing of chivalry books. He also asks his executors to apologize to the author of the false ""Second Part"" for causing him to write absurdities. Sancho, weeping, begs him not to die and to continue their shepherd life. Don Quixote insists he is now sane. He dies peacefully in his bed, a Christian. The notary testifies to his natural death and sanity. Samson Carrasco writes an epitaph. The author, Cide Hamete, concludes the history, stating his purpose was to expose the folly of chivalry books, which are now doomed to fall."
Dracula-Bram Stoker,"This detailed plot summary is based solely on the provided text, without external knowledge.

The story begins with **Jonathan Harker's Journal**. On **May 3**, Jonathan Harker, a solicitor, travels from Munich to Bistritz, Transylvania, noting the shift from West to East. He has researched the region, finding it wild and superstitious. At the Hotel Royale in Bistritz, he receives a welcoming letter from **Count Dracula**, instructing him to take a diligence to the Borgo Pass, where the Count's carriage will meet him.

On **May 4**, the hotel landlord and his wife are visibly frightened when Harker asks about Count Dracula and his castle, crossing themselves and refusing to speak. The old lady hysterically implores Harker not to go, as it is the eve of St. George's Day, when ""all the evil things in the world will have full sway."" She gives him a crucifix, which he reluctantly wears.

On **May 5**, Harker boards the diligence. Other passengers look at him pityingly and make signs against the evil eye. He overhears words like ""Satan,"" ""hell,"" ""witch,"" and ""were-wolf or vampire."" The journey through the Borgo Pass is wild and dark. A calèche with four black horses, driven by a tall man with red eyes, red lips, and sharp white teeth, overtakes them. This driver, who possesses prodigious strength, takes Harker's luggage and drives him to the Count's castle. The journey is disorienting, and at midnight, dogs and wolves howl. Blue flames appear, and the driver stops to arrange stones over them. A ring of wolves surrounds the carriage, but the driver commands them away with a gesture. They arrive at a vast, ruined castle.

Inside the castle, Harker is greeted by Count Dracula, a tall old man with a long white moustache, dressed in black. The Count's handshake is cold and strong. He insists on carrying Harker's luggage to his room. The Count declines to eat with Harker, stating he has already dined. Harker observes the Count's striking features: an aquiline nose, massive eyebrows, cruel mouth with sharp white teeth, pointed ears, and extreme pallor. He also notes hair in the Count's palms and long, sharp nails. When the Count's hands touch him, Harker feels a shudder and nausea. As dawn approaches, Harker hears wolves howling, which the Count calls ""children of the night.""

On **May 7**, Harker finds he is alone in the castle, with no servants. He realizes the Count was the coach driver. He discovers all doors are locked, making him a prisoner. He resolves to keep his fears to himself. That night, the Count discusses Transylvanian history, speaking of battles as if he were present, explaining his pride in his Szekely heritage and ancestors like Attila and a ""Dracula"" who fought the Turks. He explains the blue flames are over hidden treasure, which peasants are too cowardly to seek.

On **May 8**, Harker attempts to shave. The Count appears, but has no reflection in the mirror. Harker cuts himself, and the sight of his blood causes the Count's eyes to blaze with ""demoniac fury."" The Count grabs Harker's throat, but recoils when his hand touches the crucifix Harker wears. The Count then smashes Harker's shaving glass, calling it a ""foul bauble."" Harker realizes he is a prisoner.

Later, Harker sees the Count crawl face down like a lizard down the castle wall from his window. On **May 15**, Harker, taking advantage of the Count's absence, explores the castle. He finds a door that is not truly locked and enters a different wing, where he decides to sleep. In the early morning of **May 16**, he wakes to find three young women, who cast no shadows, in the room. They approach him, and the fair one bends to kiss his throat, her lips licking her sharp teeth. Suddenly, the Count appears in a fury, throws the woman away, and declares Harker belongs to him. The women mock him for never loving. The Count promises them Harker when he is ""done with him."" He then points to a moving bag, which one woman opens, revealing a ""half-smothered child"" whose wail Harker hears before the women and bag disappear. Harker faints.

Harker wakes in his own bed. On **May 19**, the Count forces Harker to write three post-dated letters, implying he will be held captive until late June. Harker realizes his life is at stake. On **May 28**, gypsies arrive at the castle. Harker writes secret letters, including one in shorthand to Mina, and throws them out the window with a gold piece. The Count later intercepts these, burning the shorthand letter but promising to send the one to Mr. Hawkins. Harker discovers all his papers and traveling clothes have been removed. On **June 17**, he sees the gypsies unloading large wooden boxes into the castle. He tries to escape but his door is locked. On **June 24**, he sees the Count leave the castle through his window, wearing Harker's clothes and carrying the ""terrible bag,"" realizing the Count plans to impersonate him. Harker is nearly hypnotized by swirling dust motes that take the form of the three women. He then hears a woman's agonized cry in the courtyard, shouting ""Monster, give me my child!"" Wolves pour into the courtyard, and the woman's cries cease. Harker realizes the child is gone and the woman is dead.

On **June 25**, Harker resolves to escape by climbing down the castle wall. He enters the Count's room, finds a heap of gold, and discovers a passage leading to an old, ruined chapel. In one of the large wooden boxes, he finds the Count, appearing younger, with dark hair, fuller cheeks, ruby-red skin, and lips stained with fresh blood. The Count looks ""gorged with blood."" Harker, in a fit of rage, strikes the Count's face with a shovel, gashing his forehead, but is paralyzed by the Count's ""basilisk horror"" gaze. The lid falls back. Hearing the gypsies approach, Harker flees back to his room, but the door to the winding stair locks behind him. He hears the boxes being nailed shut and the gypsies departing. He is alone with the ""awful women"" and contemplates suicide.

The narrative shifts to **Mina Murray's Journal** and **Lucy Westenra's Letters**. On **May 9**, Mina writes to her friend Lucy, mentioning Jonathan is well and returning soon. Lucy, in her letters to Mina, confesses her love for **Arthur Holmwood** and reveals she has received three marriage proposals in one day: from **Dr. John Seward**, **Mr. Quincey P. Morris**, and Arthur. She accepts Arthur.

**Dr. Seward's Diary** entries detail his patient, **R. M. Renfield**, a ""zoöphagous maniac"" who eats flies, then spiders, then sparrows, believing he can absorb their lives. Renfield repeatedly escapes to the deserted Carfax house, proclaiming the ""Master is at hand"" and offering faithfulness for reward.

Mina's journal entries from **July 24** describe her visit to Lucy in Whitby. Lucy seems well but has resumed sleepwalking. An old sailor, Mr. Swales, dismisses local superstitions but later, on **August 6**, expresses a premonition of death. A storm brews, and a strange, unsteered Russian ship, the _Demeter_, is sighted.

On **August 8**, a newspaper cutting describes the _Demeter_'s miraculous arrival in Whitby during the storm. A dead captain is found lashed to the helm with a crucifix. An immense dog leaps from the ship and disappears. The ship's cargo is 50 wooden boxes of earth. A large mastiff is found dead nearby with a torn throat and slit belly. The _Demeter_'s log, found in a bottle, recounts the mysterious disappearance of the crew one by one, and the mate's claim of seeing a ""tall, thin man"" who was impervious to a knife. The mate then jumped overboard, leaving the captain to tie himself to the wheel.

On **August 10**, Mr. Swales is found dead with a broken neck. A dog howls and cowers in terror at the churchyard. Lucy is restless and upset. On **August 11**, Mina finds Lucy sleepwalking on the East Cliff, where she sees a ""dark figure"" with ""red, gleaming eyes"" bending over Lucy. Mina covers Lucy with a shawl, accidentally pricking her throat. Lucy wakes, remembering nothing, and asks Mina not to tell her mother. Mina later notices two tiny red pin-pricks on Lucy's throat.

Lucy's health deteriorates, becoming paler and weaker, gasping for air. The wounds on her throat do not heal, becoming larger with white edges. Mrs. Westenra, Lucy's mother, reveals she is dying of a heart condition.

On **September 7**, Dr. Seward and Professor **Van Helsing** (a specialist in obscure diseases) examine Lucy. She is ghastly pale. They perform a blood transfusion from Arthur. Van Helsing notices a red mark on Lucy's throat. He returns to Amsterdam for books.

On **September 10**, Lucy is found ""more horribly white and wan-looking than ever,"" with shrunken gums and exposed teeth. Van Helsing and Seward perform another transfusion, this time with Seward's blood. Van Helsing discovers the throat wounds have disappeared. He tells Seward Lucy is dying and that ""It is only the beginning!""

On **September 17**, Lucy writes in her diary that she feels strong and is no longer afraid of sleep. That night, she is woken by flapping at the window. Her mother comes to sleep with her. A wolf's head appears at the window. Her mother, startled, tears off the garlic wreath Van Helsing had placed around Lucy's neck, and dies from a ""horrible gurgling."" Lucy feels a ""spell"" and sees myriad specks blowing in. The maids are drugged with laudanum. Lucy, alone with her dead mother, writes a memorandum, fearing she is dying.

On **September 18**, Seward and Van Helsing find Mrs. Westenra dead and Lucy near death. The garlic wreath is on Mrs. Westenra's bosom, and Lucy's throat wounds are mangled. They perform a third blood transfusion, this time with Quincey Morris's blood. Lucy's memorandum is found, describing the wolf and her mother's death. Seward learns Lucy has received blood from four men. Lucy wakes and tears the memorandum.

On **September 19**, Lucy is fading. Arthur arrives. Lucy rallies briefly, then her breathing becomes stertorous, her mouth opens, and her teeth appear longer and sharper. She asks Arthur to kiss her with a ""soft, voluptuous voice."" Van Helsing violently pulls Arthur back, shouting, ""Not for your life! Not for your living soul and hers!"" Lucy's face shows rage. Then she softens, thanks Van Helsing, and asks him to guard Arthur. Arthur kisses her forehead. Lucy dies. Van Helsing declares, ""She is dead!"" but adds, ""Not so; alas! not so. It is only the beginning!""

On **September 22**, Mina and Jonathan Harker, now married, are in London for Mr. Hawkins's funeral. Jonathan sees a tall, thin man with a beaky nose, black moustache, pointed beard, and animal-like teeth, whom he recognizes as the Count, now appearing younger. Jonathan is terrified. Mina receives a telegram announcing Lucy and Mrs. Westenra's deaths.

Seward's diary entry on **September 22** describes Van Helsing's hysterical laughter after Lucy's funeral, explaining the ""grim irony"" and that if Arthur had kissed Lucy, he would have become ""nosferatu.""

Newspaper reports from **September 25** detail a ""Hampstead Mystery"" where children are lured away by a ""bloofer lady"" and found with small, punctured wounds on their throats.

On **September 25**, Mina meets Van Helsing. She gives him her typewritten journal and Jonathan's. Van Helsing praises her intellect. Mina tells him about Jonathan's shock at seeing the Count. Van Helsing confirms Jonathan's diary is true and that the Count is in London.

On **September 30**, Jonathan, following clues from carriers, traces 21 of the Count's earth-boxes to a deserted house in Piccadilly, where he confirms the Count (disguised as ""Count de Ville"") bought the property.

The group (Van Helsing, Seward, Jonathan, Arthur, Quincey) meets. Van Helsing explains the vampire's powers and limitations: strength of twenty men, transformation into wolf or bat, control of elements, ability to vanish, but cannot enter a place without invitation, loses power at daybreak, cannot cross running water at will, and is repelled by garlic, crucifixes, and consecrated Host. He identifies the Count as Voivode Dracula.

They decide to destroy the remaining earth-boxes. Van Helsing places a piece of Sacred Wafer on Mina's forehead, which sears her flesh, leaving a red mark. Mina cries ""Unclean! Unclean!"" They all kneel and swear to destroy the monster.

They go to Carfax, find 29 boxes, and sterilize them with the Sacred Wafer. They then go to the Piccadilly house, where they find 8 more boxes and sterilize them. The Count appears, but they repel him with crucifixes and the Host. He escapes through a window, mocking them, saying his revenge has just begun and Mina is now his. He burns Jonathan's papers.

They return to Seward's house. Mina, though pale, bravely tells them that their fight is not of hate, and that the Count, a ""poor soul,"" will find ""spiritual immortality"" when destroyed. Jonathan, in grief, wishes to send the Count's soul to hell, but Mina stops him.

On **October 3**, Renfield is found severely injured, covered in blood, with a broken neck and skull fracture. He regains consciousness and recounts how the Count appeared to him in mist, promised him ""lives,"" and forced him to open his window. He also reveals the Count has been draining Mina. He struggled with the Count but was thrown down. Renfield dies.

The group bursts into Jonathan and Mina's room, finding Jonathan in a stupor and the Count forcing Mina to drink his blood from a wound on his breast. Mina's nightdress is bloodied, and she has a red mark on her forehead. The Count recoils from the Sacred Wafer and disappears as a vapor. Mina cries ""Unclean! Unclean!"" and reveals the Count forced her to drink his blood, claiming her as his companion and helper.

On **October 4**, Mina, through hypnosis, reveals the Count has taken his last earth-box aboard a ship, the _Czarina Catherine_, sailing for Varna, then up the Danube to Galatz, near his castle. Van Helsing explains the Count's ""child-brain"" thought he could escape them, but his ""baptism of blood"" on Mina now allows her to track him through hypnosis.

They decide to pursue the Count. Lord Godalming and Jonathan will take a steam launch up the river. Dr. Seward and Quincey Morris will follow on horseback along the bank. Van Helsing will take Mina overland to the Borgo Pass, near the castle, where Mina's hypnotic power will guide them. Jonathan fiercely objects to Mina going into danger, but Van Helsing explains it is to save her from becoming like the other vampire women.

On **October 15**, the group arrives in Varna. Mina, under hypnosis, reports the _Czarina Catherine_ is still at sea. On **October 17**, they arrange with officials to board the ship and destroy the Count when it arrives.

On **October 28**, a telegram reports the _Czarina Catherine_ has arrived in Galatz. Mina, using her knowledge of train schedules, tells them the next train to Galatz is tomorrow morning. Van Helsing organizes the group: Arthur to get tickets, Jonathan to get letters for the agent, Quincey to see the Vice-Consul. Seward will stay with Mina and Van Helsing.

Mina's hypnotic trances become more difficult and less clear. She describes ""confused sounds"" and ""howling of wolves."" She feels ""something is going out"" from her.

On **October 30**, they learn the _Czarina Catherine_ had a phenomenally fast, fog-shrouded voyage. The captain reports a man came aboard an hour before sunrise to receive a box for ""Count Dracula."" This man was Immanuel Hildesheim, who then gave the box to Petrof Skinsky. Skinsky's body is later found with his throat torn open. Mina deduces the Count is traveling up the Sereth or Bistritza rivers in an open boat, working against the stream, to reach his castle.

On **November 1**, Mina and Van Helsing travel by carriage, facing superstitious locals who put garlic in their food due to Mina's scar. Mina's hypnotic trances continue to report the Count is on the river.

On **November 5**, Van Helsing, leaving Mina in a ""Holy circle"" of Sacred Wafer, goes to Dracula's castle. He finds the three vampire women in their tombs. He performs the ""butchery"": cutting off their heads and staking their hearts. Their bodies crumble to dust. He places Sacred Wafer in Dracula's empty tomb, banishing him. He returns to Mina, who wakes, thin and pale but with glowing eyes.

Later that day, Mina and Van Helsing are on a rocky hillside near the castle. Mina, using Van Helsing's field-glasses, sees the Count's cart approaching, driven by gypsies, with a great square chest. Two groups of pursuers, Arthur and Quincey, and Jonathan and Lord Godalming, converge on the cart.

As the sun is setting, Jonathan and Quincey rush the cart. Jonathan throws the box to the ground. Quincey is wounded by a gypsy's knife. Jonathan and Quincey frantically open the box. The Count lies inside, deathly pale, his red eyes glaring. As the sun dips, the hate in his eyes turns to triumph. Jonathan's knife shears through his throat, and Quincey's knife plunges into his heart. The Count's body crumbles into dust. A look of peace settles on his face.

The gypsies flee. Quincey Morris, fatally wounded, points to Mina's forehead. The red scar is gone. He says, ""The snow is not more stainless than her forehead! The curse has passed away!"" Quincey Morris dies."
Frankenstein-Mary Shelley,"The narrative begins with a series of letters from Robert Walton, an English explorer, to his sister, Mrs. Saville. Walton is on a voyage to the North Pole, driven by an ardent desire for discovery and glory. He expresses his confidence in his ambitious enterprise, despite his sister's forebodings, and details his extensive preparations, including accompanying whale-fishers and studying various sciences. He also laments his loneliness and wishes for a true friend.

While his ship is trapped in ice near the North Pole, Walton and his crew witness a gigantic figure on a dog-drawn sledge speeding across the ice. The next morning, they discover another sledge and a severely emaciated European man, whom they rescue. This stranger, who refuses to board until assured they are traveling north, is brought aboard and slowly recovers. He is melancholy but possesses a cultivated mind. When questioned about his presence on the ice, he reveals he is pursuing someone who fled from him. The crew's lieutenant mentions seeing a gigantic man on a sledge the previous day, which greatly agitates the stranger, who refers to the pursued figure as a ""dæmon.""

Walton develops a deep sympathy for the stranger, who is moved by Walton's own ambition for knowledge. The stranger, recognizing a shared ""madness,"" decides to recount his tragic story as a warning. He is Victor Frankenstein, a Genevese.

Victor begins his narrative by describing his privileged childhood in Geneva, born to a distinguished family. His father, Alphonse, married Caroline Beaufort, whom he rescued from poverty after her father's death. Victor was their adored eldest child. At five, his mother adopted Elizabeth Lavenza, a beautiful orphan, who became Victor's cherished companion, whom he considered his own. Victor had a close friend, Henry Clerval, a boy of imagination and noble aspirations. While Elizabeth and Clerval were drawn to poetry and moral pursuits, Victor was consumed by a fervent desire to uncover the ""secrets of heaven and earth.""

At thirteen, Victor discovered the works of Cornelius Agrippa, igniting his passion for alchemy and the pursuit of the philosopher's stone and the elixir of life, despite his father's dismissal of these studies. A violent thunderstorm at fifteen, which shattered an oak tree, redirected his scientific interest towards modern theories of electricity and galvanism, making his former studies seem contemptible.

At seventeen, Victor's parents decided he should attend the university of Ingolstadt. Before his departure, Elizabeth contracted scarlet fever. His mother, Caroline, nursed Elizabeth back to health but succumbed to the illness herself, dying on her deathbed and expressing her hope for Victor and Elizabeth's future union. Victor's departure was delayed by grief, but he eventually left, leaving Clerval behind, whose father refused to let him pursue liberal studies.

At Ingolstadt, Victor was initially repulsed by the gruff Professor Krempe, but Professor Waldman's eloquent lecture on modern chemistry, emphasizing its boundless powers, rekindled Victor's scientific ambition. He resolved to dedicate himself to chemistry and natural philosophy, quickly surpassing his masters. After two years, he made significant discoveries.

His attention then turned to the ""principle of life."" He delved into anatomy, studying decay and corruption in charnel-houses, and after intense labor, he discovered the ""cause of generation and life"" and the ability to bestow animation upon lifeless matter. He refused to share this secret with Walton, warning of its dangers. Driven by ambition, he decided to create a human-like being of gigantic stature (eight feet tall) because of the difficulty of working with minute parts. His work consumed him, leading to ill health, nervousness, and neglect of his family.

On a ""dreary night of November,"" Victor completed his creation. The creature's ""dull yellow eye"" opened, and it breathed, but its appearance—yellow skin, watery eyes, shriveled complexion, black lips—filled Victor with ""breathless horror and disgust."" He fled his apartment. That night, he awoke from a nightmare to find the ""miserable monster"" standing over his bed, reaching out. Victor escaped and spent the night in the courtyard.

The next morning, Victor encountered Henry Clerval, who had just arrived in Ingolstadt. Victor was overjoyed, but his relief quickly turned to wild, uncontrollable agitation and a nervous fever that confined him for months. Henry nursed him, concealing the severity of his illness from Victor's family. During his delirium, Victor raved about being the murderer of William, Justine, and Clerval, and about the monster tormenting him.

Upon his recovery, Victor received a letter from Elizabeth, expressing concern for his silence and urging his return. She recounted the story of Justine Moritz, a beloved servant in their household. Victor, still haunted by his creation, found the sight of scientific instruments agonizing and turned to oriental studies with Clerval to distract himself.

Victor's father then sent a letter with devastating news: Victor's youngest brother, William, had been brutally murdered in Plainpalais. Elizabeth, who had given William a valuable miniature of Victor's mother, blamed herself, as the miniature was missing. Victor, upon seeing the gigantic figure of his creature during a thunderstorm near the murder site, immediately realized it was William's killer. He resolved to keep his knowledge secret, fearing he would be deemed mad.

Ernest then informed Victor that Justine Moritz was accused of the murder, as the miniature had been found in her pocket. Victor vehemently denied her guilt, knowing the truth. At Justine's trial, circumstantial evidence, including her confused demeanor and the miniature, led to her condemnation despite her protestations of innocence and Elizabeth's passionate defense of her character. Victor, consumed by remorse, rushed out of court.

Later, Victor and Elizabeth visited Justine in prison. Justine confessed that she had falsely admitted guilt under pressure from her confessor, who threatened her with excommunication. She maintained her innocence to Elizabeth and Victor, finding solace in the hope of meeting William in heaven. The next day, Justine was executed on the scaffold. Victor felt himself the ""true murderer"" and was overwhelmed by guilt and despair, foreseeing more woe for his family.

Victor became consumed by sorrow and remorse, shunning society. His father tried to console him, but Victor's guilt was too profound. He contemplated suicide but was restrained by thoughts of his remaining family. He developed an intense hatred for his creature and a burning desire for revenge. His father's health declined, and Elizabeth remained despondent.

Seeking relief, Victor traveled to the Alpine valleys, finding temporary solace in the sublime scenery of Chamounix. He ascended Montanvert, and there, on the glacier, he encountered his creature. Victor confronted him with furious detestation, but the creature, claiming misery had made him a fiend, demanded Victor create a female companion for him, promising to then leave mankind forever and live harmlessly in the wilds of South America. He threatened to destroy Victor's remaining friends if he refused.

Victor's rage was boundless, but the creature easily evaded him. The creature eloquently argued for his right to happiness and companionship, stating that his vices stemmed from forced solitude. Victor, moved by a sense of duty as a creator and the creature's persuasive arguments, and also fearing his threats, reluctantly agreed to create a female companion, on the condition that the creature swear to leave Europe forever. The creature swore, promising Victor would never see him again.

Victor, heavy-hearted, returned to Geneva, resolving to fulfill his abhorred task to protect his family. His father, noticing Victor's continued melancholy, suggested an immediate marriage to Elizabeth. Victor, horrified by the idea of marrying while his promise to the monster was unfulfilled, concealed his true reasons and requested to travel to England to gather necessary scientific information. His father agreed, hoping the journey would restore him. Clerval was arranged to accompany Victor to Strasburgh.

Victor and Clerval traveled through Europe to London, then to Scotland. Victor, consumed by his dreadful task, found little joy in the journey, while Clerval delighted in every new scene. Victor began collecting materials for the female creature in secret, a process that filled him with ""extreme anguish."" He resolved to complete his work in a remote spot in the Orkney Islands. He feared the monster's vengeance on his family if he delayed, and was constantly anxious about their safety.

On a desolate Orkney island, Victor established a laboratory in a vacant hut. His work, now done in ""cold blood,"" filled him with increasing horror. One evening, as he was nearly finished, he reflected on the potential consequences: the female might be more malignant, they might refuse to leave Europe, or they might propagate a ""race of devils."" He questioned his right to inflict such a curse on humanity for his own peace. At that moment, he saw the creature at his window, grinning. Filled with rage and treachery, Victor tore the half-finished female to pieces. The creature howled in ""devilish despair and revenge"" and withdrew.

Victor vowed never to resume his labors. Later that night, the creature confronted him, accusing him of breaking his promise and threatening to be ""with you on your wedding-night."" Victor lunged at him, but the creature escaped in a boat. Victor realized the threat meant his own death on his wedding night, but his primary concern was Elizabeth.

The next morning, Victor disposed of the remains of his work in the sea. He then found himself adrift in his boat, having been carried far from shore by a storm. He eventually landed in Ireland, where he was immediately arrested and accused of murder.

Victor was brought before a magistrate, Mr. Kirwin. Witnesses testified that a man had been found strangled on the beach. When Victor was taken to identify the body, he discovered it was Henry Clerval. Overwhelmed, Victor collapsed in convulsions and suffered a two-month nervous fever, during which he raved about being the murderer of William, Justine, and Clerval. Mr. Kirwin, who understood his language, heard these confessions.

Victor recovered in prison. Mr. Kirwin, showing kindness, had sent for Victor's father. Victor's father arrived, confirming Elizabeth and Ernest were safe. Victor slowly recovered, but was consumed by melancholy and a desire for revenge against the monster. He was eventually acquitted of Clerval's murder, as it was proven he was on the Orkney Islands at the time of death.

Victor returned to Geneva with his father. However, the news of Elizabeth's death proved too much for his father, who died in Victor's arms a few days later. Victor lost sensation and was confined to a solitary cell, deemed mad. Upon regaining his reason, he was consumed by a maddening rage and a renewed vow of vengeance against the monster. He sought out a criminal judge to accuse his destroyer, relating his entire history. The magistrate, though initially incredulous, was moved by Victor's tale but doubted the practicality of pursuing such a creature. Victor, furious, declared he would pursue the monster to his own death.

Victor left Geneva, now hateful to him, and began his relentless pursuit of the monster across vast portions of the earth, including Tartary and Russia. He endured immense hardships, sustained only by his desire for revenge and the solace of dreams where he saw his lost loved ones. The monster, sometimes leaving taunting inscriptions, led him northward into the ""everlasting ices."" Victor acquired a sledge and dogs and gained on the monster.

He eventually reached a hamlet on the seashore, where he learned the monster had taken provisions and a dog team and sailed across the frozen sea. Victor, filled with despair and renewed rage, followed him onto the ice. After weeks of arduous travel, he spotted the monster's sledge. As he closed in, a ground sea split the ice, separating them. Victor was left drifting on a diminishing ice floe, near death, when he saw Walton's vessel. He constructed oars from his sledge and reached the ship, his vigor exhausted, his task unfulfilled.

Victor concludes his narrative by imploring Walton to continue his quest for vengeance and destroy the monster after his own death, warning him not to be swayed by the creature's eloquence.

Walton continues his letters, describing Frankenstein's declining health and the terrifying nature of his story. He finds the creature's existence confirmed by the letters Frankenstein showed him and the sighting from his ship. Frankenstein refuses to reveal the details of his creation, warning Walton against similar ambition. Walton records Frankenstein's story, noting his guest's profound knowledge and eloquence, even in ruin.

Walton's ship becomes trapped in ice, and many of his crew die. The sailors demand Walton turn the ship south if freed. Frankenstein, despite his weakness, rouses himself to deliver an impassioned speech, shaming the sailors for their cowardice and urging them to pursue glory. The men are moved but ultimately, Walton consents to return south.

On September 11th, the ice breaks, and the passage south opens. The sailors rejoice. Frankenstein, upon learning they are returning, declares he will not give up his purpose of vengeance. He attempts to rise but faints. The surgeon states he has only hours to live.

Frankenstein, on his deathbed, expresses regret at dying before his task is fulfilled. He justifies his desire for the monster's death, arguing his duties to mankind outweighed his duties to his creature, especially after the monster's ""unparalleled malignity."" He renews his request for Walton to destroy the monster, but then retracts it, fearing his judgment is clouded by passion. His final words are a warning to Walton to ""seek happiness in tranquillity and avoid ambition."" Victor Frankenstein dies peacefully, a ""gentle smile"" on his lips.

Walton, grieving, is interrupted by a sound from Frankenstein's cabin. He enters to find the gigantic, distorted monster hanging over Frankenstein's coffin. The monster expresses profound grief and remorse, exclaiming that Frankenstein's death consummates his own crimes. He asks for Frankenstein's pardon, lamenting that he destroyed all his creator loved.

Walton confronts the monster, accusing him of hypocrisy. The monster denies this, stating his remorse for Clerval's murder, but explains that Frankenstein's pursuit of happiness while he was barred from it filled him with ""impotent envy and bitter indignation,"" making ""Evil thenceforth became my good."" He admits to murdering the innocent and devoting his creator to misery, expressing self-hatred.

The monster declares his ""work is nearly complete"" and that his own death is needed to conclude his being. He plans to quit the vessel on his ice raft, travel to the ""most northern extremity of the globe,"" build a funeral pyre, and burn his ""miserable frame"" to ashes, so no one can ever create another like him. He states that death is now his only consolation. He bids farewell to Walton, the last human he will ever see, and to Frankenstein, asserting that his own agony of remorse is superior. With ""sad and solemn enthusiasm,"" he springs from the cabin window onto the ice raft and is quickly borne away by the waves, lost in darkness and distance."
Great Expectations-Charles Dickens,"The plot summary of the provided text, ""Great Expectations,"" unfolds as follows:

**Early Life and the Convict's Threat (Chapters I-III):**
The story begins with Pip, the narrator, an orphan who lives with his older, ill-tempered sister, Mrs. Joe Gargery, and her kind husband, Joe, a blacksmith. Pip's infant tongue could only pronounce his full name, Philip Pirrip, as ""Pip,"" which became his name. He describes his deceased parents and five infant brothers, all buried in the bleak, marshy churchyard near his home, and how his childish imagination formed ideas of their appearance from their tombstones.

One raw, afternoon in the churchyard, a fearful, coarse-looking man, with a great iron on his leg, suddenly appears from among the graves. He threatens Pip with violence, demanding his name and where he lives. Pip, terrified, reveals his name and points to his village. The man turns Pip upside down, empties his pockets (finding only a piece of bread), and devours it. He then orders Pip to bring him a file and ""wittles"" (food) to an old Battery on the marshes the next morning, threatening to cut out his heart and liver if he fails. The man also claims he is not alone, and a ""young man"" with him has a ""secret way"" of harming boys, whom he is barely restraining. Pip, under duress, promises to comply and swears an oath. The man limps away towards the river, and Pip, seeing a distant gibbet, imagines him as a pirate returning to be hanged.

Pip returns home, consumed by guilt and terror over the forced larceny. Mrs. Joe, who raised him ""by hand"" (implying physical abuse), scolds him for being out. Joe, Pip's fellow-sufferer, tries to shield him. Pip hides his portion of bread and butter in his trousers for the convict. Joe notices Pip's lack of appetite, leading Mrs. Joe to violently scold and physically punish Joe. She then forces Pip and Joe to drink ""Tar-water,"" a nasty medicine. Pip, tormented by his secret, hides the food in his garret. On Christmas Eve, Pip hears a cannon fire, and Joe explains it's a warning for an escaped convict from the ""Hulks"" (prison-ships). Mrs. Joe sends Pip to bed, implying he's on his way to the Hulks for asking questions and for his planned theft.

At dawn, Pip steals food (bread, cheese, mincemeat, brandy, a meat bone, and a pork pie) and a file from Joe's forge. He runs to the misty marshes. Lost in the fog, he encounters a second man, also in coarse grey with an iron on his leg, whom he identifies as the ""young man"" the first convict mentioned. This man swears at Pip, takes a weak swing, and stumbles away into the mist. Pip then finds the first convict, shivering and hungry, at the Battery. Pip gives him the food and file. The convict, eating ravenously, asks if Pip brought anyone. Pip mentions seeing the ""young man"" with a bruised face. The convict, enraged, stuffs the remaining food away, demands the file, and furiously begins filing his own leg-iron, vowing to ""pull him down, like a bloodhound."" Pip, terrified, slips away and runs home.

**The Christmas Dinner and Apprenticeship (Chapters IV-XIII):**
Pip expects to be caught but finds the robbery undiscovered. Mrs. Joe is busy preparing for Christmas dinner, which includes pickled pork, roast fowls, mince-pie, and pudding. The guests arrive: Mr. Wopsle (the church clerk), Mr. and Mrs. Hubble (the wheelwright), and Uncle Pumblechook (Joe’s uncle, a cornchandler). Pip is subjected to constant moralizing about gratitude. When Mrs. Joe offers Uncle Pumblechook brandy, Pip is horrified, realizing he filled the bottle with tar-water. Pumblechook drinks it and has a violent, spasmodic fit, leading Pip to believe he has murdered him. Pumblechook recovers, gasping ""Tar!"" and demands gin and water.

As the pie is about to be served, Pip, unable to bear the impending discovery of his theft, runs from the house but collides with a party of soldiers at the door. The sergeant asks for Joe, the blacksmith, to fix a pair of broken handcuffs. Joe agrees, and the soldiers enter. The sergeant explains they are hunting two escaped convicts on the marshes. Everyone denies seeing them, except Pip. While Joe works at the forge, Mrs. Joe, in a rare moment of generosity, offers beer to the soldiers and brandy to the sergeant (Pumblechook intervenes to ensure it's wine, not tar-water). Pip observes the general excitement over the convict hunt. Joe, Mr. Wopsle, and Pip agree to accompany the soldiers. On the marshes, they hear shouts and find the two convicts fighting in a ditch. Pip's convict declares he ""took him!"" and ""give him up"" to the soldiers, while the other convict claims the first tried to murder him. Pip's convict boasts he dragged the ""gentleman"" villain back. As torches are lit, Pip's convict sees Pip, giving him an unreadable look. The cannon fire, and the sergeant tells Pip's convict he is ""expected on board."" At a wooden hut, Pip's convict confesses to stealing food and a pie from the blacksmith's. Joe, with ""saving remembrance of Mrs. Joe,"" tells him he's welcome to it, as they wouldn't want him to starve. The convict is then taken aboard a prison-ship, the ""black Hulk.""

Pip feels immense guilt towards Joe but fears telling him the truth. Mrs. Joe's injuries from the attack are severe, leaving her with impaired sight, hearing, memory, and speech. A filed-asunder convict's leg-iron is found at the scene, leading Pip to suspect Orlick (Joe's journeyman) or the stranger from the Jolly Bargemen. Orlick has an alibi, but Mrs. Joe's later slate-drawing of a hammer leads them to believe Orlick was the assailant. After the attack, Biddy, Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt's granddaughter, comes to live with them as Mrs. Joe's attendant, proving to be a blessing to the household, especially Joe. Mrs. Joe, despite her injuries, shows an unusual desire to conciliate Orlick.

Pip continues his annual visits to Miss Havisham, receiving a guinea each time. He feels increasingly ashamed of his common life at the forge. He confides in Biddy his desire to become a gentleman for Estella's sake, who called him ""common."" Biddy, though advising against it, listens patiently. Pip asks Joe for a half-holiday to visit Miss Havisham, which leads to another ""Rampage"" from Mrs. Joe. Joe and Pip, accompanied by Mrs. Joe (who stays at Pumblechook's), go to Miss Havisham's. Estella admits them. Miss Havisham, seeing Joe, asks if he is Pip's sister's husband. Joe, flustered, addresses Pip instead of her. Miss Havisham gives Pip twenty-five guineas as a premium for his apprenticeship, instructing him to give it to Joe. Joe, deeply moved, refuses compensation for losing Pip, saying money cannot replace ""the little child."" Miss Havisham tells Joe that Pip has been a good boy and this is his reward, and Joe should expect no more. Pip is then bound apprentice to Joe at the Town Hall, with Pumblechook taking all the credit and making Pip feel like a criminal. A celebratory dinner at the Blue Boar follows, where Pip is again humiliated. He realizes he hates his trade.

**London and New Discoveries (Chapters XIV-XLII):**
Pip's new life as Joe's apprentice is miserable; he is ashamed of his home and fears Estella seeing him. He confides in Biddy, expressing his love for Estella and his desire to be a gentleman. Biddy, in turn, reveals that Orlick, whom she dislikes, ""dances at me"" and she suspects him of the attack on Mrs. Joe.

Four years into his apprenticeship, Pip is at the Three Jolly Bargemen when a ""strange gentleman"" (Mr. Jaggers, a London lawyer) appears. Jaggers questions Mr. Wopsle about a murder trial, then identifies Joe and Pip. He reveals Pip has ""great expectations"" and will come into a ""handsome property,"" to be brought up as a gentleman. Pip must always keep the name Pip, and the benefactor's identity will remain a secret. Jaggers is appointed Pip's guardian and provides him with money for education and maintenance, suggesting Mr. Matthew Pocket (Miss Havisham's cousin) as his tutor. Joe, deeply saddened but selfless, refuses any compensation for losing Pip. Pip is overjoyed, believing Miss Havisham is his secret benefactress.

Pip moves to London, to Barnard's Inn, where he is to live with Herbert Pocket, Mr. Matthew Pocket's son. Herbert, whom Pip recognizes as the ""pale young gentleman"" he fought at Satis House, becomes his close friend. Herbert reveals Miss Havisham's story: she was a spoilt heiress, abandoned at the altar by a swindler named Compeyson, who conspired with her half-brother, Arthur Havisham, to defraud her. This happened at ""twenty minutes to nine,"" the time all her clocks stopped. Estella is Miss Havisham's adopted daughter, raised to wreak revenge on men.

Pip visits Wemmick, Jaggers's clerk, at his eccentric home, ""the Castle,"" in Walworth. Wemmick, who maintains a strict separation between his professional and private lives, introduces Pip to his deaf ""Aged Parent."" Pip confides in Wemmick his desire to help Herbert financially without Herbert's knowledge. Wemmick, in his ""Walworth sentiments,"" agrees to help. Pip secretly uses his own money to secure Herbert a partnership in Clarriker & Co.

Pip continues to visit Miss Havisham and Estella, enduring Estella's cruel indifference and her growing relationship with Bentley Drummle, whom Pip despises. Estella reveals she is going to marry Drummle, stating, ""I am what you have made me. Take all the praise, take all the blame."" Pip declares his undying love for her, but she remains cold, saying she has ""no heart."" Miss Havisham, witnessing this, shows a ""ghastly stare of pity and remorse.""

One stormy night, Pip is alone in his Temple chambers when a mysterious man appears. It is his convict, Abel Magwitch, who reveals himself as Pip's secret benefactor. He boasts of making Pip a gentleman with his earnings from sheep-farming in Australia, having risked his life to return to England to see his ""dear boy."" Magwitch reveals he was sentenced to life transportation, and his return is a felony punishable by death. Pip is horrified by the revelation and his connection to a criminal, feeling his ""great expectations"" are tainted. He locks Magwitch in Herbert's room.

Pip confesses the truth to Herbert, who is stunned. They realize Magwitch's return puts his life at extreme risk. Magwitch, unaware of their repulsion, boasts of his accomplishment. He reveals his life story: a ""warmint"" from birth, constantly in and out of jail. He met Compeyson, a gentleman swindler, who used him in his schemes. Magwitch recounts their trial, where Compeyson's gentlemanly appearance and lawyer (Jaggers) secured him a lighter sentence (seven years) while Magwitch received fourteen years. Magwitch vowed revenge on Compeyson, whom he later fought on the marshes after their escape. Herbert then reveals that Compeyson was the man who jilted Miss Havisham, and Arthur Havisham (her half-brother) was Magwitch's dying partner who raved about a mad woman in white.

**The Plan to Escape and Compeyson's Return (Chapters XLIII-LIV):**
Pip and Herbert realize Compeyson, if alive, could inform on Magwitch. Pip resolves to get Magwitch out of England. He visits Miss Havisham, who is selling Satis House. At the Blue Boar, Pumblechook, now aware of Pip's reduced fortune, gloats and claims credit for Pip's past success. Pip, disgusted, goes to the forge and finds Joe and Biddy are marrying. He is deeply moved and grateful for their goodness, apologizing for his ingratitude. He tells them he is going abroad and will repay Joe the money he paid for Pip's debts.

Pip returns to London. Wemmick warns Pip that Compeyson is alive and in London, and that Pip's chambers are being watched. Herbert devises a plan to get Magwitch (now called ""Mr. Campbell"") out of England by boat. They will house him in a secluded lodging near the river, at Mill Pond Bank, kept by Mrs. Whimple, where Herbert's fiancée, Clara Barley, lives with her growling, gout-ridden father, Mr. Barley. Pip begins rowing regularly on the Thames to establish a routine.

Pip learns from Wemmick that Jaggers's housekeeper, Molly, was tried for murder years ago and acquitted, with Jaggers defending her. She was accused of strangling a stronger woman out of jealousy and was also suspected of destroying her own child to spite the father. Jaggers's defense focused on the hands, claiming bramble scratches, not fingernails. Pip realizes Molly is Estella's mother.

Pip returns to Satis House to help Miss Havisham. He tells her he knows his benefactor is not her and that he is unhappy. He also tells her about Herbert's financial struggles and asks her to secretly provide money for Herbert's partnership. She agrees, giving him an authority to Jaggers for nine hundred pounds. Pip then reveals his love for Estella and his heartbreak over her marriage to Drummle. Miss Havisham, in a fit of remorse, falls to her knees, crying, ""What have I done!"" She confesses she stole Estella's heart and ""put ice in its place,"" intending to save her from misery but instead making her cold and proud. Pip asks about Estella's parentage. Miss Havisham reveals Jaggers brought Estella to her as an orphan child aged two or three. Pip is now certain Molly is Estella's mother.

As Pip leaves Satis House, he has a vision of Miss Havisham hanging from a beam. He goes back to check on her and finds her engulfed in flames, her bridal dress alight. He heroically throws his great-coat and another coat over her, dragging the tablecloth over her, and struggles to put out the fire. He is badly burned but doesn't feel it at the time. Miss Havisham is seriously injured, suffering from nervous shock. She repeatedly murmurs, ""What have I done!"" and ""Take the pencil and write under my name, 'I forgive her!'""

Back in London, Herbert nurses Pip's burns. Pip tells Herbert that Magwitch is Estella's father. Herbert is shocked. They decide to keep Magwitch ignorant of his wealth's forfeiture and focus on getting him out of the country.

**The Attempted Escape and Tragic End (Chapters LIV-LVI):**
Pip, Herbert, and Startop prepare for Magwitch's escape. Pip, still injured, will steer the boat, while Herbert and Startop row. Magwitch is housed at Mrs. Whimple's. They plan to take him downriver on an ebb tide, hide, and then board a foreign steamer for Hamburg or Rotterdam.

Pip receives a mysterious anonymous note instructing him to go alone to the ""little sluice-house by the limekiln"" on the marshes at nine o'clock that night for information about ""your uncle Provis."" Despite his injuries and the danger, Pip goes, fearing harm to Magwitch if he doesn't. At the inn, the landlord repeats Pumblechook's false claims of being Pip's benefactor. Pip is deeply humbled by his ingratitude to Joe.

At the sluice-house, Pip is ambushed from behind, caught in a noose, and tied to a ladder. His assailant is Orlick. Orlick, drunk and furious, reveals he was the one who attacked Mrs. Joe, saying, ""It was you as did for your shrew sister."" He claims Pip cost him his job at Miss Havisham's and gave him a bad name to Biddy. He also reveals he was the lurker on the stairs in the Temple. Orlick intends to kill Pip and burn his body in the limekiln, so no trace will be left. He warns Pip that ""them that's as good a match for your uncle Provis as Old Orlick has been for you"" are also after Magwitch. He explicitly warns of ""Compeyson, Magwitch, and the gallows!""

Just as Orlick is about to strike Pip with a stone-hammer, Herbert, Startop, and Trabb's boy burst in, having followed Pip after finding his dropped letter. They rescue Pip, who is unbound and falls to the floor. Herbert explains he found Pip's letter and, alarmed by its tone, followed him with Startop. Trabb's boy, who had seen Pip earlier, guided them to the sluice-house. Orlick escapes.

Pip, Herbert, and Startop return to London. Pip is still in pain from his arm. They decide not to pursue Orlick immediately to avoid jeopardizing Magwitch's escape.

The next day, Wednesday, they execute their plan. Pip, Herbert, and Startop take Magwitch down the river in their boat. Magwitch, softened and reasonable, is less anxious than Pip. He reflects on his past life and his longing for freedom. They pass the Custom House and two emigrant ships. As the tide slackens, they wait for the steamer. Suddenly, a four-oared galley shoots out from under the bank, hailing them. The man holding the lines identifies Magwitch as a ""returned Transport"" and calls upon him to surrender. The galley runs into their boat, causing confusion. Magwitch, seeing the steersman lay a hand on his shoulder, starts up and pulls the cloak from the shrinking sitter in the galley, revealing the face of Compeyson, the other convict from long ago. Compeyson's face tilts back in white terror. A great cry is heard from the steamer, and a loud splash as both convicts go overboard.

Pip's boat sinks. He is pulled aboard the galley. Magwitch is rescued, but Compeyson is gone. Magwitch is severely injured in the chest and head. He tells Pip he believes he went under the steamer's keel and was struck. He and Compeyson had fought fiercely underwater. Magwitch is manacled. The officer gives Pip permission to buy new clothes for Magwitch and to accompany him to London, but not Herbert and Startop. Magwitch's pocket-book, containing details of his wealth, passes to the officer. Pip's repugnance for Magwitch melts away, replaced by affection and gratitude. He sees him as a better man than he had been to Joe.

Magwitch is taken to the Police Court. Jaggers, representing him, admits nothing. Magwitch's body is found, identifiable only by papers in his pockets, which reveal his banking and land holdings in New South Wales. Magwitch is committed for trial. Pip, knowing Magwitch's possessions will be forfeited to the Crown if convicted, resolves not to claim any of it. He writes petitions to save Magwitch. Magwitch is very ill in prison, breathing with great pain. He shows a quiet submission.

At the trial, Magwitch is seated in a chair, too ill to stand. Pip holds his hand. The trial is short; Magwitch is found guilty of returning from transportation. He is sentenced to death, along with thirty-one other men and women. Magwitch, with a distinct speck of face in a shaft of light, says, ""My Lord, I have received my sentence of Death from the Almighty, but I bow to yours,"" and sits down. Pip earnestly hopes he will die before the Recorder's Report. He visits Magwitch daily, who grows weaker. On the tenth day, Magwitch, with a final effort, tells Pip he has never deserted him. Pip, holding his hand to Magwitch's breast, tells him that his child, whom he loved and lost, lived, found powerful friends, is a lady, very beautiful, and that Pip loves her. Magwitch raises Pip's hand to his lips, then gently lets it sink. His head drops, and he dies. Pip prays, ""O Lord, be merciful to him a sinner!""

**Aftermath and Conclusion (Chapters LVII-LIX):**
Pip, now deeply in debt and very ill, gives notice to quit his chambers. He suffers from fever and delirium, often confusing reality with dreams. He is nursed by Joe, who has come to London after receiving a letter from Biddy about Pip's illness. Joe, with his old kindness and simplicity, stays with Pip, who feels like ""little Pip again."" Joe has paid off Pip's debts. Pip learns from Joe that Miss Havisham died a week after his accident, leaving four thousand pounds to Mr. Matthew Pocket, ""Because of Pip's account of him."" Pip is glad, as it validates the only good thing he had done. He also learns that Pumblechook's house was broken into by Orlick, who is now in jail.

As Pip recovers, he notices Joe becomes less easy with him, calling him ""sir."" Pip realizes he has given Joe reason to doubt his constancy. He plans to tell Joe everything and propose to Biddy. After three days, he travels to his native village.

At the Blue Boar, Pumblechook again addresses Pip with false pity, reiterating his claims of being Pip's benefactor. Pip, disgusted, goes to the forge, which is closed. He finds Joe and Biddy arm in arm in the best parlour. Biddy, crying with happiness, announces, ""It's my wedding-day!... and I am married to Joe!"" Pip is thankful he never confessed his last hope to Joe. He sincerely thanks them both for their goodness and forgiveness, and tells them he is going abroad and will work to repay Joe. He asks them to tell any future children that he honored them. Pip then goes to his old room, eats with them, and they walk him to the finger-post.

Pip sells his remaining possessions, pays his creditors, and joins Herbert. Within a month, he leaves England and becomes a clerk at Clarriker and Co. Herbert goes to marry Clara. Years later, Pip becomes a partner, and Clarriker reveals Pip's secret financial help to Herbert. Pip realizes his old idea of Herbert's inaptitude was his own.

**(Alternate Ending, Chapter LIX):**
Eleven years later, Pip returns to his old home. He finds Joe, a little grey but hale and strong, with a child named Pip sitting on Pip's old stool. Joe tells him they named the child after him, hoping he would be a little like Pip. Pip takes the child to the churchyard, where the child points out the tombstone of Philip Pirrip and Georgiana. Pip talks with Biddy, who has a little girl. Biddy gently suggests Pip should marry, but he says he is an ""old bachelor"" and settled with Herbert and Clara. Biddy asks if he still frets for Estella. Pip replies that his ""poor dream... has all gone by.""

Pip secretly revisits the site of Satis House that evening. Only the old garden wall remains. He finds a solitary figure in the desolate garden—Estella. She is greatly changed, her beauty's freshness gone, but with ""indescribable majesty and its indescribable charm"" and a ""saddened, softened light"" in her eyes. She reveals she has led a most unhappy life, separated from her cruel husband (Drummle), who died two years prior. She tells Pip the garden ground is her only remaining possession, the subject of her ""only determined resistance."" She is leaving it as it is to be built on. She has often thought of him, remembering what she ""had thrown away when I was quite ignorant of its worth."" Pip tells her she has always held her place in his heart. Estella, acknowledging that ""suffering has been stronger than all other teaching,"" hopes she has been ""bent and broken... into a better shape."" She asks him to tell her they are friends. Pip says, ""We are friends,"" and as they leave the ruined place, he sees ""no shadow of another parting from her."""
Hamlet-William Shakespeare,"This summary is based solely on the provided text of ""Hamlet, Prince of Denmark.""

**Act I**

**Scene I:** On a platform before the castle at Elsinore, at night, Francisco is relieved from his watch by Bernardo. Horatio and Marcellus soon join Bernardo. Horatio, initially skeptical, has been invited to witness a ""dreaded sight"" that Bernardo and Marcellus have seen twice before. As Bernardo begins to recount the previous night's events, an apparition appears, resembling the dead King Hamlet, wearing the same armor he wore when he combated Norway. Horatio, though terrified, attempts to speak to it, charging it to speak, but the Ghost stalks away. Horatio, now convinced, describes the Ghost's appearance to be exactly like the late King. He speculates that this bodes ""some strange eruption to our state,"" recalling omens in Rome before Julius Caesar's fall. The Ghost reappears, and Horatio again tries to make it speak, asking if it has a message, if there's good to be done, if it knows the country's fate, or if it has hoarded ""extorted treasure."" The Ghost is about to speak when a cock crows, and it ""starts like a guilty thing"" and vanishes. Horatio explains that spirits retreat at the cock's crow. He suggests they tell young Hamlet, believing the spirit will speak to him.

**Scene II:** In a room of state, King Claudius addresses his court. He acknowledges the recent death of his brother, King Hamlet, but announces his marriage to Queen Gertrude, his ""sometime sister, now our queen,"" balancing grief with discretion. He grants Laertes, son of Polonius, permission to return to France after attending the coronation. The King then turns to Hamlet, who remains in mourning. Hamlet expresses his unhappiness in asides and cryptic remarks. Queen Gertrude urges Hamlet to cast off his ""nighted colour"" and accept that death is common. Hamlet insists his grief is genuine, beyond outward show. King Claudius advises Hamlet to end his ""unmanly grief,"" reminding him that all fathers die, and urges him to think of him as a father, as Hamlet is ""most immediate to our throne."" The Queen asks Hamlet to stay in Denmark and not return to Wittenberg, to which Hamlet agrees to obey. The King expresses his pleasure and orders cannons fired in celebration. After the King, Queen, and court exit, Hamlet delivers a soliloquy lamenting his mother's hasty marriage to his uncle, less than two months after his father's death. He describes his father as a god-like king compared to his uncle, whom he calls a ""satyr"" and ""beast."" He feels his heart will break but must remain silent. Horatio, Bernardo, and Marcellus enter. Hamlet greets Horatio, his fellow student from Wittenberg, and asks why they are in Elsinore. Horatio states he came for King Hamlet's funeral, which Hamlet bitterly corrects to his mother's wedding, noting the quick succession. Horatio then tells Hamlet about the apparition of his father, armed, which he and the others have seen. Hamlet is deeply troubled and questions them for details about the Ghost's appearance. He decides to join their watch that night, instructing them to keep the sighting secret. Alone, Hamlet suspects ""foul play"" and awaits the night.

**Scene III:** In Polonius's house, Laertes prepares to depart for France. He advises his sister, Ophelia, to be wary of Hamlet's affections, calling them a ""fashion, and a toy in blood,"" not permanent. He warns her that Hamlet, as a prince, cannot choose for himself, and his choice affects the state. He cautions her against risking her honor by believing his vows. Ophelia promises to heed his advice but playfully warns him not to be a hypocritical pastor. Polonius enters, hurrying Laertes to his ship and offering him a series of life precepts, including being true to himself. After Laertes leaves, Polonius questions Ophelia about what Laertes said concerning Hamlet. Ophelia reveals Hamlet has made ""many tenders of his affection"" to her ""in honourable fashion,"" supported by ""holy vows."" Polonius dismisses these as ""springes to catch woodcocks"" and commands Ophelia to ""slander any leisure moment"" by not speaking or talking with Hamlet. Ophelia promises to obey.

**Scene IV:** On the platform at night, Hamlet, Horatio, and Marcellus await the Ghost. It is cold, and they hear trumpets and cannon fire from the castle, indicating the King's revelry, a custom Hamlet disapproves of. The Ghost appears. Hamlet addresses it directly, calling it ""Hamlet, King, father,"" and demanding to know why it has left its grave. The Ghost beckons Hamlet to follow it alone. Horatio and Marcellus warn Hamlet not to go, fearing it might tempt him to madness or harm. Hamlet, undeterred, declares he values his life at nothing and his soul is immortal. He breaks free from their grasp, threatening anyone who tries to stop him, and follows the Ghost.

**Scene V:** In a more remote part of the platform, the Ghost reveals to Hamlet that he is his father's spirit, doomed to walk the night and ""fast in fires"" during the day until his ""foul crimes"" are purged. He commands Hamlet to ""Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder."" Hamlet is shocked. The Ghost explains that the official story of his death by a serpent's sting in his orchard is false. The ""serpent that did sting thy father's life / Now wears his crown""—Hamlet's uncle, Claudius. The Ghost reveals Claudius, with ""witchcraft of his wit"" and ""traitorous gifts,"" seduced Queen Gertrude, winning her to his ""shameful lust."" He describes how Claudius poured ""juice of cursed hebenon"" into his ear while he slept, causing a swift and painful death, dispatching him ""of life, of crown, of queen, at once."" He died ""Unhousel'd, disappointed, unanel'd,"" with his sins unconfessed. The Ghost urges Hamlet to avenge him but warns him not to taint his mind or contrive anything against his mother, leaving her to Heaven and her own conscience. As dawn approaches, the Ghost bids Hamlet adieu and vanishes, urging him to ""remember me."" Hamlet, overwhelmed, vows to erase all other thoughts and dedicate himself solely to the Ghost's command. Horatio and Marcellus arrive, and Hamlet, acting erratically, makes them swear on his sword not to reveal what they have seen. The Ghost's voice from beneath the ground reinforces the oath. Hamlet acknowledges he may put on an ""antick disposition"" (feigned madness) and makes them swear not to give any hint that they know his secret. He concludes that ""The time is out of joint;--O cursèd spite, / That ever I was born to set it right!""

**Act II**

**Scene I:** Ophelia, greatly distressed, tells her father Polonius that Lord Hamlet appeared to her in a disheveled state, pale, with knocking knees, a piteous look, and silent, intense gaze, before sighing profoundly and leaving without looking away from her. Polonius immediately concludes that Hamlet is ""Mad for thy love,"" attributing it to Ophelia's recent obedience to his command to repel Hamlet's letters and deny his access. He decides they must inform the King.

**Scene II:** King Claudius and Queen Gertrude welcome Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, two of Hamlet's childhood friends. The King expresses concern over Hamlet's ""transformation"" and asks them to stay at court to draw him to pleasures and discover the cause of his affliction. They agree to obey. Polonius enters, claiming to have discovered the ""very cause of Hamlet's lunacy."" He explains that Hamlet's madness stems from Ophelia's rejection of his love, presenting a love letter from Hamlet to Ophelia as proof. He recounts how he instructed Ophelia to avoid Hamlet, leading to Hamlet's decline into sadness and then madness. The King and Queen find this plausible. Polonius proposes a plan: they will ""loose"" Ophelia to Hamlet in the lobby while they hide and observe their interaction, to confirm if love is the cause. The King agrees to try it. Hamlet enters, reading. Polonius approaches him. Hamlet, feigning madness, calls Polonius a ""fishmonger"" and makes cryptic remarks about honesty, the sun breeding maggots, and warns Polonius to keep his daughter out of the sun, implying danger to her virtue. Polonius, in an aside, notes ""Though this be madness, yet there's method in it."" Hamlet continues to speak nonsensically about old men and slanders. Polonius leaves to arrange the meeting with Ophelia. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern enter. Hamlet greets them warmly but quickly discerns they were sent for by the King and Queen. He confesses his recent loss of mirth, describing the earth as a ""steril promontory"" and man as a ""quintessence of dust,"" delighting him not. They inform him that players, ""the tragedians of the city,"" are coming to court. Hamlet welcomes the news, speculating on why they travel. He observes that his uncle being king has changed public opinion, as those who mocked his uncle now pay for his picture. A flourish of trumpets announces the players. Hamlet tells his friends he is ""but mad north-north west,"" implying he can control his madness. Polonius re-enters to announce the players. Hamlet mocks him with theatrical references and lines from the story of Jephthah, which Polonius recognizes as referring to his daughter. The players enter. Hamlet welcomes them and asks for a passionate speech, specifically Æneas' tale to Dido about Priam's slaughter. The First Player recites a dramatic passage, moving Polonius to tears. Hamlet, struck by the player's ability to show such emotion for a fictional character, contrasts it with his own inaction despite having a real motive for revenge. He chastises himself for being a ""dull and muddy-mettled rascal"" and a ""coward."" He resolves to use the players to confirm the Ghost's story: he will have them perform ""The Murder of Gonzago"" before his uncle, inserting a speech of his own, to observe the King's reaction. ""The play's the thing / Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king.""

**Act III**

**Scene I:** Rosencrantz and Guildenstern report to the King and Queen that Hamlet admits to being distracted but will not reveal the cause. They mention his interest in the players and his request for the King and Queen to attend the play that night. The King is pleased. The King and Polonius send Rosencrantz and Guildenstern away so they can proceed with their plan to observe Hamlet and Ophelia. The Queen expresses hope that Ophelia's beauty will be the cause of Hamlet's wildness and that her virtues will restore him. Polonius instructs Ophelia to walk and read a book, to ""colour her loneliness"" while he and the King hide. The King, in an aside, admits his conscience is pricked by Polonius's remark about disguising evil with piety. Hamlet enters, delivering his ""To be, or not to be"" soliloquy, contemplating suicide as an escape from life's suffering, but fearing the unknown of death. He sees Ophelia. Ophelia returns his ""remembrances,"" which he denies ever giving, and questions her honesty and fairness, suggesting beauty corrupts honesty. He denies having loved her and tells her to ""Get thee to a nunnery,"" railing against himself as a ""breeder of sinners"" and all men as ""arrant knaves."" He asks where her father is, and upon learning he is home, demands the doors be shut on him. He continues his tirade against women's artifice and ""wantonness,"" declaring there will be ""no more marriages"" except for those already married, ""all but one,"" who shall live. Hamlet exits. Ophelia laments Hamlet's ""noble mind"" being ""o'erthrown"" and her own wretchedness. The King and Polonius emerge. The King concludes Hamlet's words were not like madness and his affections do not tend towards love. He decides to send Hamlet to England for ""neglected tribute,"" believing travel might cure his melancholy. Polonius, still convinced it's love, suggests that after the play, the Queen should speak with Hamlet alone while he hides and listens. The King agrees, stating, ""Madness in great ones must not unwatch'd go.""

**Scene II:** Hamlet instructs a player on how to deliver a speech naturally, avoiding overacting or clownish improvisations, emphasizing that acting should hold ""the mirror up to nature."" Horatio enters, and Hamlet praises him as a just and constant friend, not a slave to passion. He confides in Horatio about the play, revealing it will re-enact his father's murder, and asks Horatio to keenly observe the King's reaction. The King, Queen, Polonius, Ophelia, and other courtiers enter. Hamlet continues his ""antic disposition,"" making crude jokes and remarks, particularly to Ophelia. He tells Ophelia his father died ""within these two hours"" (later correcting to ""twice two months""), and jokes about his mother's cheerful appearance. The play-within-a-play, ""The Murder of Gonzago,"" begins with a prologue. The Player King and Queen express their deep love and the Queen vows never to remarry if her husband dies. Hamlet, in an aside to Horatio, calls this ""wormwood."" The Player King falls asleep. Lucianus, the Player King's nephew, enters and pours poison into the sleeper's ears. Hamlet loudly explains the plot: the murderer poisons the king ""for his estate"" and ""gets the love of Gonzago's wife."" At this point, the King rises, calls for lights, and rushes out, followed by the entire court. Hamlet and Horatio are left alone, confirming the King's guilt. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern return, reporting the King's ""marvellous distempered"" state and the Queen's desire to speak with Hamlet. Hamlet, still feigning madness, uses a recorder to illustrate that they cannot ""play upon"" him or ""pluck out the heart of his mystery."" Polonius enters, announcing the Queen awaits. Hamlet agrees to go, resolving to speak ""daggers"" to his mother but use ""none.""

**Act III, Scene III:** King Claudius, disturbed by Hamlet's behavior, tells Rosencrantz and Guildenstern that Hamlet's madness is dangerous and he will dispatch him to England with them immediately. Polonius enters, informing the King that Hamlet is going to his mother's closet and he will hide ""behind the arras"" to overhear their conversation. He assures the King the Queen will ""tax him home"" and that it's wise for someone other than the partial mother to listen. The King thanks him.

**Scene IV:** In the Queen's chamber, Polonius instructs the Queen to be firm with Hamlet and then hides behind the arras. Hamlet enters and confronts his mother. Their exchange quickly escalates, with Hamlet accusing her of offending his father. When the Queen, fearing for her safety, cries for help, Polonius calls out from behind the arras. Hamlet, thinking it is the King, cries ""A rat!"" and stabs through the arras, killing Polonius. He pulls out the body, realizing it is ""wretched, rash, intruding fool"" Polonius, not the King. Hamlet then forces the Queen to sit, intending to ""wring her heart."" He shows her two pictures, one of his father (Hyperion-like) and one of Claudius (a ""mildew'd ear,"" a ""cutpurse of the empire,"" a ""vice of kings,"" a ""king of shreds and patches""), contrasting their virtues and condemning her for leaving his noble father for such a ""wretch."" The Queen is deeply moved, seeing ""black and grainèd spots"" in her soul. As Hamlet continues to denounce her incestuous bed, the Ghost of King Hamlet reappears, visible only to Hamlet. The Ghost reminds Hamlet of his ""tardy son"" and his ""blunted purpose,"" urging him to step between his mother and her ""fighting soul."" The Queen, seeing Hamlet speak to empty air, believes he is mad. Hamlet tries to make her see the Ghost, but she sees nothing. The Ghost exits. Hamlet, proving his sanity by re-wording his accusations, urges his mother to confess to Heaven, repent, and avoid his uncle's bed. He tells her to ""assume a virtue, if you have it not."" He expresses repentance for killing Polonius and promises to ""answer well the death I gave him."" The Queen exits, and Hamlet, declaring he must be ""cruel, only to be kind,"" prepares to dispose of Polonius's body.

**Act IV**

**Scene I:** The King questions the Queen about Hamlet's profound sighs. She tells him that Hamlet, ""mad as the sea and wind,"" heard a stir behind the arras, cried ""A rat, a rat!"" and killed ""the unseen good old man"" Polonius. The King, realizing it could have been him, sends Rosencrantz and Guildenstern to find Hamlet and bring Polonius's body to the chapel. He expresses concern about Hamlet's popularity with the ""distracted multitude"" and decides to ship Hamlet to England immediately.

**Scene II:** Rosencrantz reports to the King that they cannot get Hamlet to reveal where Polonius's body is hidden. The King orders Hamlet brought before him. Hamlet speaks in riddles, saying Polonius is ""at supper"" where he is ""eaten"" by ""politick worms."" He tells the King to send to Heaven to find him, or seek him in ""the other place"" himself, or he will ""nose him"" in the lobby within a month. The King, for Hamlet's ""especial safety,"" tells him he must go to England. Hamlet agrees, calling the King his ""mother"" because ""Father and mother is man and wife; man and wife is one flesh; and so, my mother."" As Hamlet exits for England, the King reveals in an aside that he has sent letters to England, ""conjuring"" them to enact ""The present death of Hamlet.""

**Scene III:** The Queen tells Horatio she will not speak with Ophelia, but Horatio insists, saying Ophelia is ""importunate"" and ""distract,"" and may ""strew dangerous conjectures."" The Queen agrees to see her. Ophelia enters, fantastically dressed with straws and flowers, singing sorrowful and nonsensical songs about a dead love and a maid who lost her virginity. The King enters and observes her madness, attributing it to her father's death. Ophelia continues to sing and distribute imaginary flowers, giving rosemary for remembrance, pansies for thoughts, fennel for flattery, columbines for thanklessness, rue for sorrow (to the Queen), and a daisy. She mentions violets withered when her father died. She exits, still singing. The King orders Horatio to follow and watch her. He laments that ""When sorrows come, they come not single spies, / But in battalions!"" Marcellus enters, reporting that Laertes has returned in a ""riotous head,"" leading a rebellion, with the rabble crying, ""Laertes shall be king!"" Laertes bursts in, armed, demanding his father from the King. The Queen tries to calm him. Laertes, enraged, vows thorough revenge. The King assures Laertes he is guiltless of Polonius's death and promises to help him. Horatio's voice is heard outside, mentioning Ophelia. Ophelia re-enters, her madness further enraging Laertes. She sings more songs and distributes more flowers. Laertes is heartbroken, noting her madness turns ""thought and affliction"" to ""prettiness."" Ophelia exits. Laertes demands to know how his father died and why he had an ""obscure funeral."" The King promises to reveal the truth and let ""the great axe fall"" where the offense is. Bernardo enters with letters from Hamlet for the King and Queen. Hamlet's letter to the King states he is ""set naked on your kingdom"" and will beg leave to see the King tomorrow to explain his ""sudden and more strange return."" Laertes is lost in confusion but feels a ""sickness in my heart"" that he will live to confront Hamlet. The King, seeing an opportunity, proposes a plan to Laertes. He reminds Laertes of a Norman gentleman who praised Laertes' fencing skill, which Hamlet envied. The King suggests they arrange a fencing match between Hamlet and Laertes. Hamlet, being ""remiss, most generous, and free from all contriving,"" will not inspect the foils. Laertes can then choose an ""unbated"" (unblunted) sword, and in a ""pass of practice,"" ""requite him for your father."" Laertes agrees, adding he will anoint his sword with a deadly poison, so even a scratch will be fatal. The King further plots to have a ""chalice for the nonce,"" a poisoned drink, prepared for Hamlet if he escapes the sword. The Queen enters, announcing, ""Your sister's drown'd, Laertes."" She describes Ophelia's death: she made garlands of flowers, climbed a willow tree, a branch broke, and she fell into the ""weeping brook,"" her clothes pulling her down to a ""muddy death."" Laertes, struggling with his grief, exits, followed by the King and Queen.

**Act V**

**Scene I:** Two clowns (gravediggers) are digging a grave. They debate whether Ophelia, who ""wilfully seeks her own salvation"" (suicide), should receive a Christian burial, concluding it's ""crowner's-quest law"" that allows it because she was a ""gentlewoman."" They joke about the legal technicalities of drowning oneself. The First Clown asserts that grave-makers are the most ancient gentlemen, holding up Adam's profession, and that a grave-maker builds houses that last till doomsday. Hamlet and Horatio enter and observe the First Clown singing while digging and throwing up skulls. Hamlet reflects on the insensitivity of the gravedigger and the mortality of man. He picks up a skull, which the gravedigger identifies as Yorick's, the king's jester. Hamlet, who knew Yorick well, reminisces about him, holding the skull and contemplating the transience of life and beauty. He then muses on how even great figures like Alexander and Caesar return to dust and can be used for base purposes. The funeral procession for Ophelia arrives, with ""maimèd rites,"" indicating a doubtful death. Laertes, the King, Queen, and mourners follow the corpse. Hamlet and Horatio hide. The Priest explains that Ophelia's obsequies have been ""as far enlarg'd / As we have warranty"" and that only ""great command o'ersways the order"" to allow her Christian burial, as her death was ""doubtful."" Laertes, furious at the limited ceremony, wishes violets to spring from Ophelia's flesh and curses the ""churlish priest."" The Queen scatters flowers on the grave, saying, ""Sweets to the sweet: Farewell!"" and expresses her hope that Ophelia would have been Hamlet's wife. Laertes, overcome with grief, leaps into the grave, calling for dust to be piled upon him and Ophelia. Hamlet then reveals himself, declaring his identity as ""Hamlet the Dane"" and grappling with Laertes in the grave. Hamlet proclaims his immense love for Ophelia, claiming ""forty thousand brothers / Could not, with all their quantity of love, / Make up my sum."" He challenges Laertes to prove his grief. The Queen attributes Hamlet's outburst to madness. Hamlet, still ranting, exits. The King tells Horatio to follow Hamlet and reassures Laertes that their plan will proceed.

**Scene II:** Hamlet tells Horatio he regrets his ""forgot myself"" moment with Laertes, recognizing the ""portraiture of his"" grief in his own. Osric, a foppish courtier, enters and welcomes Hamlet back to Denmark. He delivers a message from the King, challenging Hamlet to a fencing match with Laertes. The King has wagered six Barbary horses against six French rapiers and poignards, with the condition that in a ""dozen passes,"" Hamlet will not exceed Laertes by more than three hits. Hamlet agrees, despite a ""gain-giving"" (misgiving) in his heart. He dismisses Horatio's concern, stating, ""we defy augury: there is a special providence in the fall of a sparrow.""

The court assembles for the fencing match. The King, Queen, Laertes, Horatio, Osric, and attendants are present. Hamlet offers Laertes his pardon for the wrong he has done, comparing it to shooting an arrow over a house and hurting a brother. Laertes accepts the apology ""in nature"" but reserves his ""revenge"" until his honor is satisfied by a judge. They prepare to fence. The King sets out stoups of wine and announces that if Hamlet hits Laertes first or second, or quits in answer to the third, cannons will fire, and he will drink to Hamlet's health, dropping a ""union"" (pearl) into the cup. Hamlet makes the first hit, a ""palpable hit."" The King offers him the poisoned cup, but Hamlet defers drinking. They play a second bout, and Hamlet hits again. The Queen, against the King's warning, drinks from the poisoned cup to Hamlet's fortune and falls back, poisoned. Laertes, feeling a pang of conscience, wounds Hamlet with his poisoned, unbated rapier. In the ensuing scuffle, they exchange rapiers, and Hamlet wounds Laertes with the poisoned blade. Osric calls for help for the Queen. Laertes, dying, confesses that he is ""justly killed with mine own treachery,"" revealing the poisoned sword and the Queen's poisoning, and blames the King. Hamlet, realizing the treachery, stabs the King with the poisoned rapier and forces him to drink the rest of the poisoned wine, killing him. Laertes dies, exchanging forgiveness with Hamlet. Hamlet, also dying from the poison, asks Horatio to report his story accurately to the ""unsatisfied."" Horatio attempts to drink the remaining poison to join Hamlet, but Hamlet snatches the cup away, urging Horatio to ""absent thee from felicity awhile"" and live to tell his story. Hamlet dies, his last words being, ""The rest is silence."" The play concludes with a dead march."
Jane Eyre-Charlotte Brontë,"The plot of the provided text, ""Jane Eyre,"" unfolds as follows:

The story begins with Jane Eyre, a young orphan, living at Gateshead Hall with her aunt, Mrs. Reed, and cousins, Eliza, John, and Georgiana. On a cold, rainy winter day, Jane is excluded from the family's drawing-room due to her perceived ""unsociable"" disposition. She retreats to the breakfast-room, where she finds a book of British Birds and hides in a window-seat. Her cousin, John Reed, discovers her, verbally abuses her, and then throws the book at her, injuring her head. Enraged, Jane retaliates by calling him a ""wicked and cruel boy"" and comparing him to a murderer. Mrs. Reed, alerted by the commotion, orders Jane to be locked in the ""red-room,"" a grand, seldom-used chamber where her deceased uncle, Mr. Reed, had died.

In the red-room, Jane initially resists but is overpowered by Bessie, the nurse, and Abbot, the lady's-maid. They chastise her, reminding her of her dependent status and the threat of the poorhouse. Locked alone in the room, Jane reflects on the injustices she suffers at Gateshead, contrasting her constant blame with her cousins' indulged faults. She recalls her uncle's deathbed promise to Mrs. Reed to raise Jane as her own. Overwhelmed by fear and a belief in her uncle's ghost, Jane is terrified by a gleam of light and screams, shaking the locked door. Mrs. Reed, Bessie, and Abbot return. Mrs. Reed dismisses Jane's fear as a trick and extends her punishment, causing Jane to lose consciousness.

Jane wakes in her own bed, attended by Bessie and Mr. Lloyd, an apothecary. Mr. Lloyd, a stranger to the household, brings Jane a sense of relief. Bessie and a housemaid whisper about Jane's fit and Mrs. Reed's harshness. The next day, Jane is weak and miserable. Mr. Lloyd questions her, and Jane reveals her unhappiness stems from being an orphan and her cruel treatment, including being ""knocked down"" by John and locked in the ""ghost room."" She mentions Mrs. Reed's assertion that she has ""poor, low relations."" Mr. Lloyd asks if she would like to go to school, and Jane expresses a strong desire for a change. Mr. Lloyd recommends to Mrs. Reed that Jane be sent to school. Jane later overhears Bessie and Abbot discussing Mrs. Reed's eagerness to send her away, and learns details about her parents' deaths from typhus fever and her uncle, John Eyre, a wine-merchant in Madeira, who had once inquired about her but was told by Mrs. Reed that Jane was at school.

Weeks pass, and Jane remains isolated. John attempts to bully her again, but Jane fights back, hitting his nose. She defiantly tells Mrs. Reed that her children are ""not fit to associate with me."" Mrs. Reed punishes her physically. Later, Mr. Brocklehurst, the treasurer and manager of Lowood Institution, visits Gateshead. Mrs. Reed introduces Jane to him, falsely accusing her of deceit and asking him to keep a strict eye on her at Lowood. Mr. Brocklehurst, a stern and hypocritical clergyman, questions Jane about her piety, criticizes her for not liking Psalms, and gives her a pamphlet about a deceitful child's sudden death. He describes Lowood as a place for cultivating humility, contrasting it with his own splendidly dressed family. After he leaves, Jane confronts Mrs. Reed, declaring her hatred and exposing Mrs. Reed's cruelty, particularly the red-room incident. Mrs. Reed is frightened and leaves. Jane feels a mix of triumph, remorse, and loneliness. Bessie comforts her, revealing Mrs. Reed's intention to send her to Lowood soon.

Jane departs for Lowood, a charity-school for orphans, on January 19th. She refuses to bid Mrs. Reed farewell. The journey is long, and she arrives at Lowood in the dark and rain. She meets Miss Temple, the kind superintendent, and Miss Miller, an under-teacher. Jane learns about the school's harsh conditions: insufficient clothing, scanty and often burnt food (porridge), and long hours of study and religious observance. Miss Temple, however, shows compassion, ordering a lunch of bread and cheese for the hungry girls after a burnt breakfast. Jane befriends Helen Burns, a girl who is constantly chastised and even physically punished by the cruel teacher Miss Scatcherd for her untidy habits. Helen, however, endures her suffering with Christian patience and forgiveness, advocating for love over revenge. Jane, in contrast, expresses her desire to fight back against injustice. Helen shares her belief in an afterlife and the spiritual nature of existence. Jane confides her past sufferings at Gateshead to Helen. Miss Temple, hearing Jane's story, writes to Mr. Lloyd, who corroborates Jane's account. Miss Temple publicly clears Jane of Mrs. Reed's accusations, bringing Jane relief and renewed purpose. Jane excels in her studies, learning French and drawing.

The school is then struck by a typhus fever epidemic, caused by the unhealthy site and poor conditions. Many girls fall ill and some die, including Helen Burns, who suffers from consumption. Jane, deeply saddened, creeps to Helen's bedside one night and finds her dying but serene. Helen comforts Jane with her faith in God and the promise of a joyful afterlife. Jane wakes to find Helen dead. Public inquiry into the epidemic leads to reforms at Lowood: a new building, improved diet and clothing, and a committee to manage the school, though Mr. Brocklehurst retains his position with less power.

Jane remains at Lowood for eight years, six as a pupil and two as a teacher. Miss Temple, her beloved mentor, marries and leaves, causing Jane to feel restless and desire a new life beyond Lowood. She advertises for a governess position and receives an offer from Mrs. Fairfax of Thornfield Hall. Before leaving, Bessie visits, informing Jane of John Reed's death by suicide, Mrs. Reed's subsequent stroke, and her aunt's dying wish to see Jane. Bessie also reveals that Jane's uncle, John Eyre, had visited Gateshead years ago, seeking Jane, but Mrs. Reed had lied, saying Jane was dead.

Jane arrives at Thornfield Hall, a grand, old manor. She meets Mrs. Fairfax, the kind housekeeper, and her pupil, Adèle Varens, a lively French girl who is Mr. Rochester's ward. Jane learns that Mr. Rochester is the owner of Thornfield and a peculiar, well-traveled man. She also hears a strange, mirthless laugh from the third floor, attributed by Mrs. Fairfax to Grace Poole, a servant. One evening, while out walking, Jane encounters a man whose horse has slipped on ice. She helps him, only to discover later that he is Mr. Rochester, who has returned to Thornfield.

Mr. Rochester, recovering from his sprained ankle, is a stern, dark-featured man, but with a captivating intellect. He invites Jane and Adèle to tea, where he tests Jane's character with probing questions and praises her drawings. He reveals Adèle is the illegitimate daughter of Céline Varens, a French opera-dancer with whom he had a ""grande passion"" before discovering her infidelity and mercenary nature. He brought Adèle to England out of a sense of duty. Jane, despite her efforts to suppress it, finds herself falling in love with Mr. Rochester, even as she observes his flirtation with the beautiful and accomplished Blanche Ingram, a guest at Thornfield. Jane sketches portraits of herself and Blanche to remind herself of their unequal stations.

One night, Jane is awakened by a ""savage, shrilly sound"" and a struggle from the third floor. Mr. Rochester quickly calms the alarmed guests, attributing it to a servant's nightmare. However, he secretly enlists Jane's help. He leads her to a hidden room on the third floor, where she finds Mr. Mason, a visitor from the West Indies, bleeding from wounds (bites and cuts) inflicted by a ""clothed hyena"" whom Jane recognizes as the ""Vampyre"" from her dream. Mr. Rochester reveals this ""maniac"" is his mad wife, Bertha Mason, whom he keeps confined with Grace Poole as her keeper. He instructs Jane to tend to Mason and keep silent about the incident, then leaves to fetch a surgeon. Mason, before being taken away, murmurs that Bertha ""bit me"" and ""sucked the blood."" Mr. Rochester confesses that Bertha is from a mad family and he was tricked into marrying her for her fortune. He explains his misery and his attempt to find happiness with Jane.

Soon after, Jane receives news that Mrs. Reed is dying and wishes to see her. She obtains leave from Mr. Rochester and returns to Gateshead. Mrs. Reed, on her deathbed, confesses her long-standing hatred for Jane and her mother. She reveals that Jane's uncle, John Eyre of Madeira, had written three years prior, wishing to adopt Jane and make her his heiress, but Mrs. Reed, out of malice, had lied and told him Jane was dead. Mrs. Reed dies, still hating Jane.

Jane returns to Thornfield, only to find the hall a ""blackened ruin,"" destroyed by fire. The innkeeper informs her that Bertha Mason set the fire and then jumped from the roof to her death. Mr. Rochester, in his heroic attempt to save her and the servants, lost one eye and a hand, and the sight of his other eye, becoming ""stone-blind"" and a ""cripple."" He now lives in seclusion at Ferndean, a remote manor-house, with only his old servants, John and Mary.

Jane immediately travels to Ferndean. She finds Mr. Rochester, blind and disfigured, but still with his strong spirit. He is initially unaware of her presence, but his dog, Pilot, recognizes her. Jane reveals herself, and Mr. Rochester is overcome with joy and disbelief, thinking she is a vision. Jane tells him about her uncle John Eyre's death and her inheritance of twenty thousand pounds, making her an ""independent woman."" She offers to stay with him as his companion, nurse, and eyes. He is deeply moved and asks her to marry him. Jane accepts, declaring her love and her happiness in being useful to him.

Mr. Rochester confesses his remorse for his past actions and his belief that God's chastisements (his blindness) have humbled him and led him to repentance. He reveals that just four nights before, he had called out ""Jane! Jane! Jane!"" in anguish, longing for her, and a voice had replied, ""I am coming: wait for me."" Jane realizes this was the mysterious summons she heard at Moor House.

Jane marries Mr. Rochester in a quiet ceremony. She informs her cousins, Diana and Mary Rivers, who approve. St. John Rivers, however, does not reply to her letter. Jane brings Adèle from her strict school to a more indulgent one nearby, and Adèle thrives.

Ten years later, Jane and Edward Rochester are happily married. He recovered partial sight in one eye after two years, and can now dimly see. When their first son is born, he can see that the boy has inherited his own bright eyes. Diana and Mary Rivers are both married and visit annually. St. John Rivers went to India as a missionary, pursuing his arduous work with unwavering zeal. He remains unmarried and, in his last letter to Jane, anticipates his approaching death, filled with ""divine joy"" for his heavenly reward. Jane concludes her narrative, profoundly content in her union with Edward."
Madame Bovary-Gustave Flaubert,"The plot of the provided text, ""Madame Bovary,"" unfolds as follows:

**Part I**

The story begins with the introduction of a new, awkward country lad named Charles Bovary to a school class, where his cap and stammering pronunciation of his name (""Charbovari"") cause general amusement and punishment. Charles is depicted as a conscientious but unexceptional student. His father, Monsieur Charles Denis Bartolome Bovary, a retired assistant-surgeon-major with a scandalous past, married for money and squandered his wife's fortune, leading to a life of idleness and philandering in the countryside. Charles's mother, initially affectionate, became embittered by her husband's behavior and managed the household. Charles's upbringing was a mix of his mother's spoiling and his father's attempts at Spartan discipline.

At twelve, Charles began irregular lessons with the local curé, and at sixteen, he was sent to school in Rouen. He was an average student who later studied medicine. Initially diligent, he soon succumbed to idleness, frequenting public-houses and pursuing casual affairs. He failed his first medical examination but passed the second after intense cramming. He then set up a medical practice in Tostes, succeeding an old doctor.

Charles's mother found him a wife, Madame Dubuc (Heloise), a 45-year-old widow with a supposed income. Heloise was ugly, controlling, and jealous, making Charles's married life restrictive and unhappy. Arguments frequently arose between Heloise and Charles's mother. It was eventually revealed that Heloise's fortune was largely fictitious, her property mortgaged, and her money lost to a absconding notary. Charles's father was enraged by this deception. Heloise soon fell ill, spitting blood, and died suddenly. Charles was deeply saddened, realizing her love for him.

One night, Charles was called to the Bertaux farm to treat Monsieur Rouault, a prosperous farmer, for a broken leg. There, he met Emma, Monsieur Rouault's daughter, who assisted him during the bandaging. Emma, with her dark eyes and delicate hands, captivated Charles. He began visiting the farm frequently, enjoying Emma's presence. His first wife, Heloise, grew suspicious and jealous, making accusations about Emma's ""good education."" To avoid conflict, Charles swore on a prayer-book to stop visiting the Bertaux.

After Heloise's death, Monsieur Rouault visited Charles, offering condolences, payment, and an invitation to the farm. Charles, now enjoying his independence, accepted. He became infatuated with Emma, deciding to propose marriage. Monsieur Rouault, eager to marry off his daughter, agreed, signaling Emma's acceptance by opening a window shutter. The wedding was set for the following spring, after Charles's mourning period.

The wedding was a large, boisterous affair with 43 guests, lasting sixteen hours. The guests, mostly country folk, engaged in heavy eating, drinking, and crude jokes. Charles's mother was displeased, while his father smoked and drank all night. Charles, initially reserved, became openly affectionate with Emma the next day. Two days later, they left for Tostes.

In Tostes, Emma began redecorating their house, but soon felt a profound disillusionment. Charles's commonplace conversation and lack of ambition bored her. She yearned for the grand passions and refined life she read about in novels. She found Charles's contentment with their mundane life insulting. Her attempts to force herself to love him failed. She felt trapped and longed for something extraordinary to happen.

An invitation to a ball at the Marquis d'Andervilliers' château at Vaubyessard offered a glimpse into the aristocratic world she craved. At the ball, Emma was dazzled by the luxury, the elegant guests, and the music. She waltzed with a Viscount, experiencing a moment of intense, almost sensual, connection. The ball intensified her dissatisfaction with her own life. She felt her past life fade into insignificance.

Upon returning to Tostes, the memory of the ball became an obsession. She kept a cigar case found by Charles (belonging to the Viscount) as a memento. She devoured Parisian journals and romantic novels, creating an idealized vision of city life and love. She grew irritable and neglected her household. Charles's mother visited, criticizing Emma's extravagance and lack of domesticity, leading to a quarrel. Emma, suffering from ""nerves,"" pushed her daughter Berthe away, causing the child to fall and cut her cheek. Charles, oblivious, attributed Emma's distress to her illness.

Charles decided to move to Yonville-l'Abbaye, hoping a change of air would improve Emma's health. While packing, Emma found her old, withered wedding bouquet and threw it into the fire, symbolizing the end of her illusions about her marriage. Emma was pregnant when they left Tostes.

**Part II**

They arrived in Yonville-l'Abbaye, a stagnant market town. At the Lion d'Or inn, they met Monsieur Homais, the local chemist, a self-important man of science and progress, and Léon Dupuis, a shy notary's clerk. Homais, eager to gain Charles's favor (to protect himself from legal issues regarding his unlicensed medical practice), was overly helpful. Emma and Léon quickly discovered a shared romantic sensibility and longing for a more exciting life, forming an unspoken bond.

Emma gave birth to a daughter, Berthe, but was disappointed it wasn't a son and showed little maternal affection. Homais became Berthe's godfather. Charles's father, visiting for the baptism, flirted with Emma, causing Charles's mother to hasten their departure. Emma visited Berthe at the nurse's, accompanied by Léon, which led to local gossip. Emma and Léon's connection deepened during their walks. Léon, bored with Yonville, decided to move to Paris to finish his law studies. Their farewell was emotionally charged, with Emma feeling a profound loss.

After Léon's departure, Emma sank into a deep melancholy, regretting not having acted on her feelings for him. She indulged in extravagant purchases from Monsieur Lheureux, a cunning draper who offered goods on credit. Charles, still oblivious, was delighted by Emma's renewed interest in the house and her apparent maternal affection for Berthe. He encouraged her to take music lessons in Rouen, unaware that these weekly trips served as her rendezvous with Léon.

**Part III**

Emma and Léon began their affair in Rouen, spending three passionate days at the Hotel-de-Boulogne. They reveled in their secret love, dining on islands and making romantic declarations. However, a chance remark by a boatman about a ""tall handsome man with small moustaches"" named ""Adolphe"" or ""Dolpe"" made Emma shiver, hinting at Rodolphe's past.

Back in Yonville, Emma continued her weekly trips to Rouen to meet Léon. She became more brazen, neglecting her household and spending lavishly on clothes and gifts for Léon. Lheureux, her creditor, manipulated her, offering more credit and eventually tricking her into signing bills and a power of attorney to manage her father-in-law's estate, which she used to sell a small property. Charles, still trusting, was unaware of the extent of her debts.

Emma's affair with Léon became monotonous. She found the same ""platitudes of marriage"" in adultery. Léon, initially thrilled, grew wary of her demands and the risks involved. He received an anonymous letter warning him about his affair, and his employer, Lawyer Dubocage, advised him to break it off. Léon, seeking to settle down, decided to end the relationship.

Emma's financial situation spiraled out of control. Lheureux, now holding all her debts, presented her with a summons for 8,000 francs. Desperate, she sought help from various people in Yonville, including Monsieur Guillaumin, the notary, who made lewd advances when she asked for money. Humiliated, she fled. She then tried to borrow from Binet, the tax-collector, who recoiled from her desperate advances.

In a final, desperate attempt, Emma went to Rodolphe at La Huchette, confessing her ruin and begging him for 3,000 francs. Rodolphe, though initially moved, coldly refused, claiming he didn't have the money. Emma, enraged, accused him of never loving her and pointed out his luxurious possessions. Rodolphe remained impassive, repeating his refusal.

Emma left Rodolphe's house in a state of shock and despair. Overwhelmed by her financial ruin and emotional betrayal, she experienced hallucinations. In an ""ecstasy of heroism,"" she rushed to Homais's pharmacy, where she tricked Justin into giving her the key to the Capharnaum, his private laboratory. She found a blue jar containing a white powder (arsenic) and consumed it.

She returned home, calm and serene. Charles, distraught by the news of the distraint, found her. Emma wrote a letter, sealed it, and told him to read it the next day, forbidding questions. She soon began to feel the effects of the poison, experiencing a bitter taste, sickness, vomiting blood, convulsions, and excruciating pain. Charles, realizing she was poisoned, was frantic. Doctors Canivet and Lariviere were summoned. Lariviere, a renowned surgeon, declared there was nothing more to be done.

As Emma lay dying, Charles, Homais, Canivet, and the curé, Bournisien, gathered. The curé administered extreme unction. Emma, in a moment of lucidity, asked for her looking-glass and wept at her reflection. As her final death-rattle began, the blind man's song was heard outside, singing about love and summer days. Emma, raising herself like a ""galvanised corpse,"" cried ""The blind man!"" and laughed an ""atrocious, frantic, despairing laugh"" before falling back and dying.

**Conclusion**

After Emma's death, Charles was consumed by grief. Homais, ever the opportunist, invented a story about Emma mistaking arsenic for sugar and published a self-serving article. Charles insisted on burying Emma in her wedding dress with white shoes and a wreath, in three coffins, covered with green velvet. Homais and Bournisien, despite their disagreements, attended the vigil and funeral. Old Rouault arrived, fainting at the sight of the coffin. Charles was led away from the grave, feeling a vague satisfaction that it was over. Justin was found weeping at Emma's grave, revealing he was the potato thief.

Charles's financial troubles continued. Lheureux pressed for payment, and Charles, refusing to sell any of Emma's belongings, pledged exorbitant sums. His mother, exasperated, left him. Félicité, the servant, ran away with Theodore, stealing Emma's remaining clothes. Charles received news of Léon's marriage. One day, he found Rodolphe's letter to Emma in the attic, finally realizing her infidelity. He was distraught but, unable to fully grasp the depth of her betrayal, attributed it to ""fatality.""

Charles, now a long-bearded, shabbily clothed, wild man, neglected his patients and spent his days weeping. He met Rodolphe, who, though initially pale, offered him beer. Charles gazed at Rodolphe, seeing Emma in his face, and wished he had been that man. He told Rodolphe, ""I don't blame you now. It is the fault of fatality!""

One evening, Charles was found dead in the arbour, a long tress of Emma's black hair in his hand. A post-mortem found nothing. After everything was sold, only a small sum remained, used to send Berthe to her grandmother. Her grandmother died, and old Rouault was paralyzed. Berthe was taken in by an aunt and sent to work in a cotton-factory.

Monsieur Homais, having attacked all subsequent doctors in Yonville, flourished. He gained an enormous practice, was respected by authorities, and finally received the cross of the Legion of Honour, fulfilling his lifelong ambition."
Mrs. Dalloway-Virginia Woolf,"The story opens with Mrs. Clarissa Dalloway, a woman in her early fifties, preparing for a party she is hosting that evening. She decides to buy the flowers herself, reflecting on her youth at Bourton, particularly her memories of Peter Walsh, an old friend and former suitor, who is expected back from India. She recalls their intense relationship, his criticisms of her, and her ultimate decision not to marry him, believing it would have been destructive for both of them. She also thinks about her husband, Richard Dalloway, and their daughter, Elizabeth. As she walks through London, she observes the vibrant city life, the lingering effects of the recent War on people like Mrs. Foxcroft and Lady Bexborough, and encounters another old friend, Hugh Whitbread, who mentions his wife Evelyn's recurring illness.

While Clarissa is at the florist's, Mulberry's, a violent explosion from a motor car backfiring causes a stir in Bond Street. The car, with its blinds drawn, sparks rumors about the identity of the important person inside, possibly the Prime Minister or royalty. Among the onlookers are Septimus Warren Smith, a pale and apprehensive man in his early thirties, and his young Italian wife, Lucrezia (Rezia). Septimus is deeply disturbed by the event, experiencing intense fear and believing the world is on the verge of bursting into flames, and that he is being watched and judged. Rezia tries to calm him, worried about his mental state and his threats of suicide, which he has made before. She wishes he were dead rather than suffering this way.

Later, an aeroplane flies overhead, writing letters in smoke across the sky. While others try to decipher the advertising message (Glaxo, Kreemo, Toffee), Septimus interprets the smoke as profound, beautiful messages meant for him, bringing tears to his eyes. He experiences vivid hallucinations, seeing trees come alive, sparrows singing in Greek, and his deceased friend from the War, Evans. He believes he is receiving universal truths about love and the absence of crime. Rezia, desperate, tries to make him focus on ""real things"" as advised by Dr. Holmes, who has dismissed Septimus's condition as mere ""nerve symptoms."" Septimus, however, sees Dr. Holmes as a ""brute"" and a symbol of ""human nature"" that seeks to control and destroy him.

Clarissa returns home, still feeling the sting of not being invited to Lady Bruton's lunch. She reflects on her life, her marriage, and her past love for Sally Seton, recalling a kiss they shared. As she mends her green party dress, Peter Walsh arrives unexpectedly, having just landed from India. Their reunion is charged with emotion. Peter, still critical of Clarissa, reveals he is in love with a married woman named Daisy in India, who has two children, and he is in London to consult lawyers about a divorce. Overwhelmed, Peter bursts into tears, and Clarissa comforts him, momentarily wondering if her life would have been happier had she married him. Their conversation is interrupted by the arrival of Elizabeth, Clarissa's daughter, and Peter abruptly leaves, reminding Clarissa of her party.

Peter walks through London, reflecting on Clarissa's conventionality and his own perceived failures. He recalls his painful rejection by Clarissa at Bourton, a scene by a fountain where she ended their relationship. He also thinks about his current love for Daisy, which he describes as more natural than his feelings for Clarissa. He falls asleep in Regent's Park and wakes with the phrase ""The death of the soul"" on his lips, recalling Clarissa's prudish reaction to a past conversation about a housemaid with a child. He observes Septimus and Rezia in the park, noting their distress.

Meanwhile, Septimus's condition worsens. He continues to have visions and believes he is being hunted by Dr. Holmes and Sir William Bradshaw, whom he sees as agents of a cruel ""human nature."" Rezia, terrified, sends for Dr. Holmes again, declaring her husband is mad. Septimus, feeling trapped and condemned, believes he must escape. As Dr. Holmes forces his way into their room, Septimus, in a desperate act of defiance against the doctors and the ""brute"" human nature, flings himself from the window onto the area railings below. He dies horribly mangled. Rezia, witnessing this, is given a sweet drink by Dr. Holmes and drifts into a dream-like state, remembering happier times.

Later that evening, Clarissa's party is in full swing. The Prime Minister makes an appearance, causing excitement among the guests. Clarissa greets everyone, feeling a sense of insincerity but also a deep connection to life. Ellie Henderson, Clarissa's poor cousin, feels out of place but observes the scene. Peter Walsh arrives, and he and Sally Seton (now Lady Rosseter), Clarissa's old friend, reconnect. They discuss their past, Clarissa's marriage to Richard, and Sally's belief that Clarissa is a snob.

The Bradshaws arrive at the party. Lady Bradshaw discreetly informs Clarissa that a young man has killed himself by jumping from a window. Clarissa is deeply shaken by the news, feeling it as ""her disaster"" and ""her disgrace."" She retreats to a small room, contemplating the young man's death as an act of defiance, an attempt to communicate in the face of an intolerable life, perhaps caused by men like Sir William Bradshaw. She feels a profound connection to the deceased young man, understanding his act as an ""embrace in death.""

Looking out her window, Clarissa sees an old lady in the house opposite going to bed, an ordinary act that strikes her with its solemnity and mystery, contrasting with the ""love and religion"" of Miss Kilman, which Clarissa believes destroy the ""privacy of the soul."" The clock strikes, and Clarissa, feeling ""somehow very like him—the young man who had killed himself,"" experiences a mix of beauty and fun in life, despite the tragedy. She resolves to return to her guests, to Sally and Peter.

Peter and Sally are still talking when Clarissa re-enters the room. Peter, feeling an ""extraordinary excitement,"" realizes, ""It is Clarissa."" The story concludes with Clarissa's return to her party, her presence filling the room."
Pride and Prejudice-Jane Austen,"The story begins by introducing the Bennet family, whose mother, Mrs. Bennet, is consumed by the desire to marry off her five daughters. Her excitement is piqued when she learns that Netherfield Park, a nearby estate, has been let to Mr. Bingley, a wealthy, single young man. Despite Mr. Bennet's teasing and initial reluctance, he secretly pays a visit to Mr. Bingley, only revealing it to his astonished family after the fact.

At the Meryton assembly (ball), Mr. Bingley proves to be amiable and dances frequently, showing particular admiration for Jane Bennet, the eldest daughter. However, his friend, Mr. Darcy, a very rich and handsome man, is perceived as proud and disagreeable, refusing to dance with most ladies. Elizabeth Bennet, the second eldest, is offended when she overhears Darcy comment that she is ""tolerable; but not handsome enough to tempt _me_."" Mrs. Bennet is delighted by Bingley's attention to Jane but furious at Darcy's rudeness.

Elizabeth observes Jane falling deeply in love with Bingley, but notes Jane's composed nature conceals her true feelings. Elizabeth is less impressed by Bingley's proud and conceited sisters, Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley. Meanwhile, Mr. Darcy, despite his initial disdain, finds himself increasingly drawn to Elizabeth's intelligence and lively spirit. Miss Bingley, noticing Darcy's interest, attempts to divert his attention by criticizing Elizabeth's family.

Jane falls ill after riding to Netherfield in the rain (a situation Mrs. Bennet orchestrated to keep her there) and is forced to stay. Elizabeth walks three miles through the mud to care for her sister, an act that earns her contempt from the Bingley sisters but kindness from Mr. Bingley. Darcy, though still reserved, admits Elizabeth's eyes were ""brightened by the exercise."" During Elizabeth's stay, the Bingley sisters frequently criticize the Bennets' low connections, a sentiment Darcy appears to share. Darcy also reveals his ""good opinion once lost is lost for ever,"" and in a witty exchange, Elizabeth suggests his defect is a ""propensity to hate everybody,"" to which he replies hers is ""wilfully to misunderstand them.""

The Bingley party abruptly leaves Netherfield for London, with Miss Bingley sending a letter to Jane stating they will not return for the winter and expressing her hope that Bingley will marry Mr. Darcy's sister, Georgiana. Jane is heartbroken, believing Bingley is indifferent, but Elizabeth suspects Miss Bingley's manipulative intentions, believing Bingley is being influenced by his friends due to the Bennets' lack of wealth.

Mr. William Collins, the pompous and obsequious entailed heir to Longbourn, arrives for a visit. He announces his intention to marry one of the Bennet daughters as ""amends."" After Mrs. Bennet informs him Jane is likely engaged, he proposes to Elizabeth. Elizabeth firmly refuses, but Collins dismisses her refusal as female coyness. Mrs. Bennet, furious, appeals to Mr. Bennet, who gives Elizabeth an ultimatum: her mother will disown her if she doesn't marry Collins, but he will disown her if she *does*. Collins, feeling slighted, withdraws his proposal and immediately turns his attentions to Elizabeth's friend, Charlotte Lucas. Charlotte, seeking a secure ""establishment,"" accepts his proposal, much to Elizabeth's astonishment and disappointment.

Elizabeth visits Charlotte at Hunsford Parsonage in Kent, where she frequently dines at Rosings, Lady Catherine de Bourgh's grand estate. Lady Catherine is a domineering and impertinent woman who questions Elizabeth extensively. During this visit, Mr. Darcy and his cousin, Colonel Fitzwilliam, arrive at Rosings. Colonel Fitzwilliam inadvertently reveals that Darcy ""saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage"" and shares guardianship of Miss Darcy with him. Elizabeth deduces that Darcy was responsible for separating Bingley and Jane, driven by his pride in their social inferiority and his desire for Bingley to marry his sister.

Mr. Darcy unexpectedly proposes to Elizabeth, declaring his love but also emphasizing her ""inferiority"" and the ""degradation"" of the connection. Elizabeth vehemently rejects him, accusing him of ruining Jane's happiness and behaving cruelly to Mr. Wickham. Darcy admits his role in separating Bingley and Jane and defends his actions. Elizabeth further accuses him regarding Wickham, based on Wickham's earlier account. Darcy, in turn, accuses Elizabeth of having her pride hurt and defends his feelings as ""natural and just."" Elizabeth reiterates her ""immovable dislike"" and Darcy leaves.

The next day, Darcy gives Elizabeth a letter. In it, he explains his reasons for separating Jane and Bingley, citing Jane's apparent indifference and the Bennet family's lack of propriety and low connections. He also refutes Wickham's claims, revealing Wickham to be a profligate man who squandered an inheritance and later attempted to elope with Darcy's fifteen-year-old sister, Georgiana, for her fortune. Elizabeth is initially indignant but, upon re-reading, realizes the truth of Wickham's character and the justice of Darcy's concerns about her family. She is ""absolutely ashamed of herself,"" recognizing her own ""vanity, not love, has been my folly."" She feels growing respect and gratitude for Darcy.

Elizabeth returns to Longbourn to find that her youngest sister, Lydia, has eloped with Mr. Wickham from Brighton. The family is in deep distress, fearing they are not married. Elizabeth, overwhelmed, accidentally reveals the news to Mr. Darcy, who shows genuine concern. Mr. Gardiner, Elizabeth's uncle, goes to London to assist Mr. Bennet in the search. Mr. Gardiner's letter eventually brings good news: Darcy, feeling responsible for Wickham's unexposed character, intervened. He paid off Wickham's substantial debts, settled money on Lydia, and purchased Wickham a commission in the Regulars, on the condition that Wickham marry Lydia. Mrs. Bennet is ecstatic, oblivious to the scandal and the financial sacrifice. Elizabeth is deeply humbled and grateful to Darcy.

Lydia and Wickham return to Longbourn as a married couple. Lydia is shamelessly boastful and casually reveals that Mr. Darcy was present at her wedding, which Elizabeth had not known. Elizabeth writes to Mrs. Gardiner for a full explanation, learning the complete extent of Darcy's generous and self-sacrificing actions. She realizes her love for him.

Mr. Bingley returns to Netherfield and, after several visits, proposes to Jane, who joyfully accepts. Mrs. Bennet is ecstatic. Soon after, Lady Catherine de Bourgh makes a furious visit to Longbourn, having heard a report of Elizabeth's impending marriage to Darcy. She demands Elizabeth promise never to accept his hand, citing Darcy's supposed engagement to her own daughter and Elizabeth's inferior connections. Elizabeth, with calm dignity, refuses.

Lady Catherine's interference, however, has an unintended positive effect on Darcy. He reveals to Elizabeth that her refusal to promise not to marry him gave him hope. He confesses his love again, and Elizabeth, having overcome her prejudices and recognizing his true character and self-sacrifice, accepts his proposal. Darcy also reveals he confessed his past interference to Bingley, who has forgiven him and is now happily engaged to Jane. Mr. Bennet, after initial surprise, gives his consent, and Mrs. Bennet is overjoyed by the prospect of such a wealthy marriage.

The story concludes with the marriages of Jane to Mr. Bingley and Elizabeth to Mr. Darcy. Bingley and Jane eventually move to an estate closer to Pemberley. Kitty, removed from Lydia's influence, improves. Wickham and Lydia, whose characters remain unchanged, live extravagantly and frequently rely on financial assistance from Elizabeth and Darcy. Miss Bingley, though mortified, drops her resentment to maintain access to Pemberley. Georgiana Darcy and Elizabeth form a close bond. Lady Catherine, after initial indignation, eventually reconciles with Darcy and Elizabeth. The Gardiners remain intimate friends, recognized by Darcy and Elizabeth for their crucial role in uniting them."
Robinson Crusoe-Daniel Defoe,"The narrative begins with Robinson Crusoe, born in York in 1632 to a German father and a mother from the Robinson family. As the third son, he was not trained for a trade, and his mind was filled with ""rambling thoughts"" of going to sea, against the wishes of his ""wise and grave"" father. His father advised him to pursue a ""middle state"" of life, free from hardship and ambition, citing the unfortunate death of Crusoe's elder brother in the Low Country wars as a warning against disregarding parental counsel. Though initially moved by his father's tears and prophecies of misery, Crusoe's desire for adventure soon returned.

At eighteen, he attempted to gain his mother's support for a single voyage, but she refused, confirming his father's steadfast opposition. Almost a year later, on September 1, 1651, Crusoe impulsively embarked on a ship bound for London with a companion, without his parents' blessing. A violent storm arose, terrifying the inexperienced Crusoe and leading him to repent his disobedience and vow to return home if spared. However, after the storm abated, his companion's mockery and a shared bowl of punch led him to forget his resolutions.

Six days later, while anchored in Yarmouth Roads, a second, more terrible storm struck. The ship was severely damaged, losing its masts, and sprung a leak. Crusoe, overwhelmed with fear and guilt, worked at the pumps until he fainted. The crew was eventually rescued by a boat from another ship, but their own vessel sank shortly after. The survivors reached Yarmouth, where they received aid. The ship's master, Crusoe's companion's father, sternly warned Crusoe never to go to sea again, seeing his misfortunes as a divine judgment. Despite this, shame prevented Crusoe from returning home, and he eventually traveled to London, resolved to seek another voyage.

Crusoe then embarked on a voyage to Guinea (the coast of Africa) as a gentleman, not a sailor. He befriended the ship's captain, who offered him free passage and the chance to trade. Crusoe invested £40 in trifles, which, thanks to the captain's honesty, yielded him nearly £300 in gold-dust. He also gained some knowledge of navigation. However, he suffered a severe fever due to the climate. Upon their return, the captain died. Crusoe, now a ""Guinea trader,"" decided to repeat the voyage with the former mate as the new captain. This second voyage was disastrous: their ship was attacked and captured by a Turkish rover from Sallee. Crusoe was taken prisoner and made a slave by the rover's captain.

For two years, Crusoe was held captive, performing household chores and ship duties. He constantly plotted escape but saw no opportunity. An unexpected chance arose when his master, short on money, frequently went fishing in the ship's pinnace, taking Crusoe and a young Moorish boy named Xury. Crusoe proved adept at fishing. One day, his master ordered him to take the boat with Xury and another Moor to catch fish for guests. Crusoe secretly provisioned the boat with food, water, tools, and three guns. Once at sea, he tricked the Moor into bringing gunpowder and shot. He then threw the Moor overboard, threatening to shoot him if he returned, and the Moor swam to shore. Xury, pledging loyalty, remained with Crusoe.

Crusoe steered south along the African coast, avoiding the Moors. After five days, he anchored in a river mouth. They heard terrifying noises of wild beasts at night, and Crusoe fired his gun to scare away a large creature, possibly a lion, that approached their boat. Needing water, Xury bravely went ashore and shot a hare-like creature for food, also finding fresh water. They later found a better water source. Crusoe, lacking navigation instruments, continued south, hoping to encounter European ships. He tried to sail towards the Canary Islands but was driven back by winds. During one stop, Xury spotted a sleeping lion. Crusoe shot it, breaking its leg, then killed it with a second shot to the head. Xury finished it off, and they skinned it for a bed.

After ten more days of sailing, they encountered naked black natives, who traded dried meat and corn for signs of thanks. While there, two leopards ran into the sea; Crusoe shot one, astonishing the natives, who helped him drag it ashore. He gave them the flesh but kept the skin. The natives also provided water. Eleven days later, Crusoe rounded a point, realizing it was Cape de Verde, and saw the islands. Soon after, Xury spotted a Portuguese ship. Crusoe signaled distress, and they were taken aboard. The captain, a kind and generous man, refused payment for passage, promising to deliver Crusoe's goods to Brazil. He bought Crusoe's boat for 80 pieces of eight and offered 60 for Xury, promising to free Xury in ten years if he converted to Christianity. Xury agreed.

Crusoe arrived in Brazil, where the captain's generosity (including payment for the animal skins) left him with about 220 pieces of eight. He settled as a planter, learning the trade. He sent for £100 of his money from London, which was invested in tools and a European indentured servant, brought by the Portuguese captain. Crusoe prospered, buying a slave and another servant. However, driven by a desire for faster wealth, he agreed to a secret proposal from three merchants to go as supercargo on a voyage to Guinea to acquire slaves. He made arrangements for his plantation in his absence, naming the Portuguese captain his heir.

On September 1, 1659, exactly eight years after his first ill-fated voyage, Crusoe embarked. The ship, carrying trade goods for slaves, was caught in a violent hurricane near the coast of Guiana. After twelve days, with one man dead and a man and boy washed overboard, the ship was disabled. A second storm struck, driving them westward. The ship struck a sandbank, and all eleven men aboard launched a boat. A massive wave overturned it, drowning everyone except Crusoe, who was swept ashore, bruised and half-dead, the sole survivor on a desolate island.

Crusoe found himself without food, clothes, or weapons, fearing wild beasts. He found fresh water and spent his first night sleeping in a tree. The next morning, he was astonished to see the ship had floated closer to shore and was still upright. He swam to it and salvaged provisions (biscuit, rum), tools (carpenter's chest, grindstone, saws, axe, hammer), arms (fowling-pieces, pistols, swords), ammunition (powder, shot), clothes, bedding, and sails. He built a raft, making several trips to the ship before a storm finally broke it apart. He narrowly escaped a storm on his last trip, returning to shore just as the ship vanished.

He established a fortified habitation under a rock, building a double-staked fence reinforced with cables and turf. He dug a cave behind his tent, which served as a cellar and storage. A lightning storm made him realize the danger of his gunpowder supply, so he carefully divided his 240 pounds of powder into many small parcels and hid them. He hunted goats, learning their habits, and killed a she-goat with a kid, which he tried to tame but eventually ate. He made a lamp from goat tallow and a clay dish.

To keep track of time, he carved a large cross-shaped post with the date of his landing (September 30, 1659) and notched it daily. He found pens, ink, paper, Bibles, and navigation books from the wreck. His dog swam ashore and became his loyal companion; he also had two cats. He reflected on his past life and current condition, finding comfort in God's providence.

He discovered that corn (barley and rice) had sprouted from discarded husks near his fortification, which he initially saw as a miracle. He carefully saved and sowed the grains, learning about the island's two rainy and two dry seasons. His first crop failed due to improper timing, but a second sowing yielded a small harvest. He learned to make baskets from local wood and, after much experimentation, successfully fired clay pots and baked bread in a makeshift oven. These efforts occupied his third year.

In his fourth year, he explored the island further, discovering a pleasant valley with cocoa, orange, lemon, and grape trees. He dried grapes into raisins for winter food. He caught a young parrot and eventually taught it to speak his name. He also rescued a young kid from his dog, which he tamed and raised, beginning a flock of tame goats to provide meat and milk, especially as his gunpowder supply dwindled. He learned to make butter and cheese.

Around his 15th year on the island, he discovered a man's naked footprint on the shore. This filled him with terror, leading him to believe savages were visiting the island. He fortified his dwelling further, planting a thick grove of trees to conceal it and creating a hidden cave for his powder and spare arms. He resolved to avoid contact with the cannibals, who he later discovered feasted on human remains on the island's west side. He debated the morality of attacking them but decided against it unless directly threatened.

In his 23rd year, he saw a fire on his side of the island. He observed nine naked savages with two canoes, feasting on human flesh. He prepared for defense but they left with the tide. He was filled with indignation and planned to attack them if they returned. After 15 months of apprehension, he saw five canoes and over thirty savages land. He witnessed them killing and preparing a prisoner. Another prisoner, a white man, escaped and ran towards Crusoe's dwelling. Crusoe, feeling a divine call, intervened. He shot two of the pursuers, saving the man.

The rescued savage, whom Crusoe named Friday (after the day of his rescue), showed absolute submission, becoming Crusoe's faithful servant. Friday, a comely young man, was terrified by the gun but quickly learned English. He explained that his people were Caribs and that the other savages had brought four prisoners, three of whom they had eaten. Crusoe made Friday burn the human remains and taught him to eat cooked meat and bread, and to avoid salt. He clothed Friday and built him a separate tent within his fortifications.

Crusoe began to instruct Friday in Christianity. Friday revealed that 17 ""white bearded men"" (Spaniards) from a shipwreck lived peacefully with his nation on the mainland. This news rekindled Crusoe's hope of escape. He and Friday began building a large canoe, taking great care to position it near the water to avoid his previous mistake. After much labor, they completed a boat large enough for 20 men, and Crusoe fitted it with a mast, sail, and rudder.

In his 27th year, with the boat ready, Friday reported three canoes of savages on shore, with three prisoners. Crusoe, Friday, and the rescued Spaniard prepared for battle. They attacked the savages, killing several and rescuing two more prisoners: Friday's father and another Spaniard. Friday's joy at seeing his father was immense. They brought the two weak men to a new tent outside Crusoe's main dwelling. The island now had Crusoe, Friday, Friday's father (a pagan), and two Spaniards (one Protestant, one Papist). Crusoe allowed ""liberty of conscience.""

Friday's father reported that the escaping savages from the attack had been so terrified by the guns that they believed the island was enchanted and guarded by ""heavenly spirits,"" deterring further visits. The rescued Spaniard revealed that 16 more of his countrymen and Portuguese, shipwrecked, were living in distress on the mainland. Crusoe proposed rescuing them if they swore loyalty and accepted his command. The Spaniard, showing great prudence, advised waiting for another harvest to ensure sufficient provisions for all 20 men and a voyage. They agreed, and the four men worked diligently, cultivating more land and harvesting a large quantity of corn and raisins.

With ample provisions, Crusoe sent the Spaniard and Friday's father to the mainland in a canoe to bring back the other 16 men, with strict instructions for their loyalty. Eight days later, Friday reported a boat approaching, and Crusoe saw an English ship at anchor. He suspected foul play, as English ships had no regular business there. He observed eleven men land, three of whom were bound prisoners. He realized they were mutineers who had set their captain, his mate, and a passenger ashore.

The mutineers carelessly let their boat get stranded by the tide. Crusoe, armed with Friday, approached the three distressed prisoners. The captain explained his crew had mutinied. Crusoe offered help under two conditions: he would retain authority on the island, and if the ship was recovered, he and Friday would receive free passage to England. The captain and his men agreed. They attacked the mutineers, killing two of the most villainous and capturing the rest.

The captain, mate, and passenger were reunited. Crusoe, still posing as the ""governor"" of the island, lectured the captured mutineers, threatening them with hanging in England but offering them the choice to stay on the island. They chose to stay. Crusoe left them firearms, ammunition, tools, and instructions for living, including how to manage the goats and prepare food. He also told them about the 17 Spaniards to be expected and made them promise to treat them well.

The next day, two of the mutineers swam to the ship, begging to be taken back, and were eventually accepted after promising good behavior. On December 19, 1686, after 28 years, 2 months, and 19 days on the island, Crusoe departed on the recovered ship, taking his goat-skin cap, umbrella, a parrot, and all his money.

He arrived in England on June 11, 1687, after 35 years' absence. He found his father and mother dead, and only two sisters and two nephews remaining. His old benefactor, the widow, was alive but impoverished, and he provided for her. The ship's owners, grateful for his actions, gave him almost £200.

Crusoe then traveled to Lisbon to inquire about his Brazil plantation. He reunited with his old Portuguese captain, who informed him that his partner was alive, but his trustees were dead. His plantation, presumed lost, had been managed by the government, with profits going to the king and a monastery. However, his claim was valid, and the plantation had become very prosperous, yielding over £1000 a year. The captain also revealed he owed Crusoe money and goods from a past shipwreck. Crusoe, moved by the captain's honesty, generously settled accounts, returning money and granting the captain and his son an annual income from the plantation.

Crusoe, now wealthy, decided to return to England. He sent money to his widow benefactor and his sisters. He wrote to the Prior of St. Augustine, donating a portion of his recovered profits to the monastery and the poor. He wrote to his partner, acknowledging his industry and giving instructions for the plantation, promising to return. He sent presents to his partner's family.

Despite his wealth, Crusoe felt an aversion to sea travel. Two ships he considered taking both met disaster. He decided to travel by land through Spain and France with a company of English and Portuguese gentlemen and servants, including Friday. They encountered severe snow and dangerous wolf attacks in the Pyrenees. Friday bravely saved their guide from wolves and comically killed a bear. After a perilous journey, they arrived safely in Dover on January 14.

Crusoe settled his affairs in England, married, and had three children, but his wife died. His nephew, now a ship captain, returned from a successful voyage. In 1694, Crusoe, still restless, agreed to join his nephew on a trading voyage to the East Indies. During this voyage, he revisited his island, finding his colony thriving. He learned of the Spaniards' conflicts with the mutineers he left behind, their eventual subjugation of them, and their battles with Caribbeans. He found about 20 children on the island, born from the Spaniards' capture of eleven men and five women from the mainland. He stayed for twenty days, leaving supplies, arms, tools, and two workmen (a carpenter and a smith). He divided the land among them, retaining ownership, and secured their commitment to stay. He then sailed to Brazil, bought a bark, and sent more people, including seven women, cows, sheep, and hogs, to the island. He later learned that the colony had survived a massive invasion by 300 Caribbees due to a storm destroying the enemy canoes. Crusoe concludes by promising to recount further adventures in a second part of his story."
Six Characters in Search of an Author-Luigi Pirandello,"The play opens with a theater company rehearsing a Pirandello play called ""Mixing It Up."" The Manager is frustrated with the abstract nature of the play and the actors' performances.

Suddenly, six mysterious figures, referred to as ""Characters,"" enter the stage, emanating a ""tenuous light."" They are: The Father, The Mother, The Step-Daughter, The Son, The Boy (14), and The Child (4). The Manager is annoyed by the interruption, but The Father explains they are ""characters in search of an author"" because their creator abandoned them without completing their story. They wish to live their drama through the Manager and his company.

The Step-Daughter, vivacious and impudent, eagerly offers their story, suggesting they can be the Manager's new play. She performs a song and dance, then passionately outlines their tragic narrative: the Child will die, the Boy will do ""stupid things,"" and she will run away. She reveals that she, the Boy, and the Child are ""bastards,"" and The Son, the legitimate child, despises them and their common Mother. The Mother, overwhelmed, faints.

The Father attempts to explain their complex family history. He states that The Mother is his wife, but she had a lover (now deceased). The Mother protests, claiming The Father forced her to leave him and go with the other man. The Step-Daughter contradicts this, asserting that The Mother lived happily with her (the Step-Daughter's) father (the lover) and only claims coercion to gain sympathy from The Son, who neglects her. The Father admits he sent The Mother away, partly for her freedom and partly for his own, after he observed a silent understanding developing between her and his secretary. He claims he later watched her new family from afar with ""pure interest.""

The Step-Daughter then reveals a shameful secret: as a young girl, The Father used to follow her home from school, giving her gifts. Years later, after her own father died and her family fell into poverty, The Mother began working for Madame Pace, a modiste who secretly ran a brothel. The Step-Daughter recounts how The Father, driven by ""miserable flesh,"" encountered her in Madame Pace's shop, where he was a client, and was about to proposition her for money when The Mother arrived. The Father insists he recognized The Mother ""in time"" and brought the entire family back to his home.

The Son expresses his disgust and shame, feeling like an unwanted intruder in his own house. He states he is an ""unrealized character"" and wants no part in this drama. The Father points out The Boy, who is timid and humiliated, and reveals that both The Boy and The Child will eventually disappear from their story. The Manager, despite the chaos and the characters' philosophical digressions about reality and illusion, sees the dramatic potential and agrees to try staging their story, instructing his prompter to take down the dialogue.

In Act II, the characters emerge from the Manager's office, with The Step-Daughter expressing her reluctance to participate. She finds a revolver in The Boy's pocket, suggesting he should have used it on The Father and The Son. The Son laments the public exposure of his parents' private lives. The Manager begins to set the stage for Madame Pace's shop, with the characters arguing over the accuracy of the set design.

The Manager casts his actors in the roles of the characters. The Father and Step-Daughter are dismayed by the actors' inability to capture their true ""temperaments"" and ""souls."" The Father, through a ""magic of the stage,"" causes Madame Pace herself to appear on stage, much to the surprise and indignation of the actors. The scene between The Step-Daughter and Madame Pace begins, but Madame Pace speaks in an unintelligible jargon, and The Step-Daughter explains that her quiet speech is because The Father is waiting nearby.

The Father then enters, and the scene where he propositions The Step-Daughter unfolds. The Mother, watching, is overcome with anguish. The Step-Daughter, in mourning, refuses his advances. The Manager is pleased but wants to ""lighten"" the scene, which infuriates The Step-Daughter, who insists on the ""truth"" of her humiliation, including The Father's suggestion to ""take off this little frock."" She accuses the Manager of trying to create a ""romantic sentimental scene"" and ignore her ""part"" and the deep-seated reasons for her suffering. The Mother cries out, expressing her continuous torment and the pain of seeing her children relive their suffering. The Father adds that The Step-Daughter is fixated on that ""fleeting and shameful moment"" to punish him eternally. The Manager, pleased with the dramatic intensity, calls for the curtain, which is mistakenly lowered completely.

Act III opens with a garden set. The characters continue to dispute how their story should be staged, particularly The Son's refusal to participate and The Step-Daughter's insistence on portraying the full extent of their misery. The Father argues that for the characters, their story is their ""sole reality,"" immutable and fixed, unlike the actors' ""game of art"" or the Manager's own transient reality.

The Manager attempts to stage a scene involving The Mother and The Son. The Son adamantly refuses to act, claiming he stands for the author's original will not to put them on stage. He implies The Father has embellished their story. The Manager presses The Son to reveal what happened after he left his room. The Son reluctantly describes walking in the garden. The Manager, noticing The Mother's distress, asks about The Child. The Son reveals The Child was ""in the fountain."" The Father adds that The Mother was following The Son. The Son then describes running to save The Child, but seeing The Boy standing motionless, staring at his drowned sister.

At this moment, a revolver shot is heard from behind the trees where The Boy is hidden. The Mother screams and rushes towards the sound. Some actors declare The Boy dead, while others insist it's ""make believe."" The Father cries out, ""Pretence? Reality, sir, reality!"" The Manager, utterly exasperated by the chaos and the blurring lines between fiction and reality, exclaims, ""Pretence? Reality? To hell with it all! Never in my life has such a thing happened to me. I've lost a whole day over these people, a whole day!"" The curtain falls."
The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn-Mark Twain,"Huckleberry Finn, the narrator, begins by recounting how he and Tom Sawyer found a robber's hidden money, making them rich with $6,000 each. Judge Thatcher invested their money, providing Huck with a dollar a day. The Widow Douglas adopted Huck to ""sivilize"" him, but he found her ways too restrictive and briefly ran away. Tom Sawyer persuaded him to return by promising him a spot in a band of robbers.

Living with the Widow and her sister, Miss Watson, Huck struggles with their attempts to educate and reform him. He finds their lessons on religion and manners tedious. He is particularly unimpressed by stories of Moses after learning he is dead, and he dismisses prayer when his attempts to get fishing hooks through it fail. He also notes Miss Watson's hypocrisy in taking snuff while forbidding him to smoke.

One night, Huck sneaks out to join Tom Sawyer. They pass Miss Watson's enslaved man, Jim, who is sleeping in the kitchen doorway. Tom plays a trick on Jim by hanging his hat on a tree limb above him. Jim later elaborates on this event, claiming witches rode him across the state, making him a respected figure among other enslaved people, and he wears a five-cent piece as a charm from the devil.

Tom, Huck, and other boys form ""Tom Sawyer's Gang"" in a cave. They take a blood oath to keep secrets and kill anyone who betrays them or harms their families. When it's pointed out Huck has no family, he offers Miss Watson. The gang plans to be highwaymen, robbing and murdering, and ""ransoming"" captives (a concept Tom doesn't fully understand but insists on because it's ""in the books""). The gang's activities are mostly pretend, and Huck soon resigns, finding no profit in their imaginary adventures. Tom's elaborate stories, like an ambush on ""Spanish merchants and A-rabs"" that turns out to be a Sunday-school picnic, further disillusion Huck.

Months later, in winter, Huck has learned to read and write a little. He finds his abusive, alcoholic father, Pap, has returned, evidenced by his distinctive boot tracks in the snow. Fearing Pap will take his money, Huck ""sells"" his $6,000 to Judge Thatcher for a dollar. That night, Huck consults Jim's magic hair-ball, which, after being ""paid"" with a counterfeit quarter, predicts Pap's indecision and Huck's future troubles and joys, warning him to stay away from water as he is ""gwyne to git hung.""

Huck finds Pap in his room. Pap is angry about Huck's education and ""starchy clothes,"" demanding he quit school and give him money. Pap takes Huck's dollar. Pap then tries to get Huck's money from Judge Thatcher, but fails. The Judge and Widow try to gain legal guardianship of Huck, but a new judge refuses to separate father and son. Pap, pleased, forces Huck to borrow money from Judge Thatcher, which Pap uses to get drunk and cause trouble, leading to his arrest. The new judge attempts to reform Pap, but Pap quickly relapses, trading his new clothes for whisky, breaking his arm, and nearly freezing to death.

Pap recovers and kidnaps Huck, taking him to a secluded log cabin on the Illinois shore. He keeps Huck locked up, frequently leaving to trade fish and game for whisky, then returning to get drunk and beat Huck. Huck initially enjoys the freedom from ""sivilization"" but grows tired of the beatings and isolation. He finds an old saw and begins cutting a hole in the cabin wall. One night, Pap has a violent fit of delirium tremens, chasing Huck with a knife and threatening to kill him. Huck escapes by slipping out of his jacket.

Huck decides to fake his own death to escape Pap. He finishes sawing the hole, gathers provisions (food, blankets, gun, etc.), shoots a wild pig, and uses its blood to stage a murder scene in the cabin. He smashes the door, drags a sack of rocks (to simulate a body) to the river, and leaves a trail of cornmeal to a lake to suggest robbers fled there. He then hides his canoe and raft. He falls asleep in the canoe and wakes to see Pap rowing by, sober. Huck quickly paddles away, eventually reaching Jackson's Island.

On Jackson's Island, Huck sees a ferryboat firing a cannon over the water, trying to make his ""carcass"" float. He catches a bread loaf containing quicksilver, which people use to find drowned bodies. He sees many townspeople on the ferry, including Tom Sawyer and the Widow. He hides. After they leave, Huck makes a camp. Days later, exploring the island, he finds a still-smoking campfire. Scared, he hides. That night, he discovers the campfire belongs to Jim, Miss Watson's enslaved man, who has run away. Jim explains he overheard Miss Watson planning to sell him to New Orleans. Jim is terrified Huck is a ghost but is relieved to find him alive. Jim tells Huck about his escape and various superstitions.

Huck and Jim move their belongings to a large cavern on the island. A severe storm causes the river to rise. They find a floating two-story frame-house and board it. Inside, they discover a dead man shot in the back, whom Jim covers, telling Huck not to look at the face. They salvage many items, including eight dollars in silver. Jim warns Huck about bad luck from touching a snake-skin. Later, Huck plays a prank by placing a dead rattlesnake on Jim's blanket, but its mate bites Jim. Jim is laid up for four days, and Huck feels guilty.

They continue downriver on their raft. Huck feels guilty about helping Jim escape, believing it to be a sin against Miss Watson. Jim expresses his desire to earn money to buy his wife and children out of slavery, even suggesting hiring an Abolitionist to steal them if necessary. This further troubles Huck's conscience. When they see a light, Jim believes it's Cairo, the free state. Huck paddles to shore, intending to turn Jim in, but when Jim expresses his deep gratitude, calling Huck his ""best fren',"" Huck cannot bring himself to do it. He lies to two men with guns who are looking for runaway enslaved people, claiming his ""pap"" on the raft has smallpox. The men, fearing contagion, give Huck forty dollars and tell him to float twenty miles further downriver.

Huck and Jim realize they missed Cairo in the fog. Their canoe is stolen. A steamboat crashes into their raft, splitting it apart, and they are separated. Huck swims to shore and finds refuge in a log house belonging to the Grangerford family. He assumes the name ""George Jackson.""

The Grangerfords are involved in a long-standing, violent feud with another family, the Shepherdsons. Buck Grangerford, a boy Huck's age, explains the feud's history of killings. Huck witnesses a gunfight between the families. Miss Sophia Grangerford asks Huck to retrieve her Testament from church, where he finds a note with ""Half past two"" written on it. He later realizes this was a message for her to elope with Harney Shepherdson. The elopement reignites the feud, leading to a bloody ambush where Buck, his father, and two brothers are killed. Huck finds Buck's body and covers his face. Disgusted and sickened by the violence, Huck flees to the swamp, where he is reunited with Jim, who had found the damaged raft and repaired it with the help of some enslaved people.

Huck and Jim continue downriver. They pick up two con men: an old man who claims to be the rightful Duke of Bridgewater, and a younger man who claims to be the rightful King of France (Louis XVII, the Dauphin). Huck quickly sees through their lies but plays along to avoid conflict. The ""duke"" and ""king"" begin performing cons in towns along the river. Their first Shakespearean show is a failure, but the ""duke"" devises a new show, ""The Royal Nonesuch,"" with a ""LADIES AND CHILDREN NOT ADMITTED"" sign, which draws a packed house. The king performs naked and painted, making the audience laugh. The first night's audience, feeling ""sold,"" conspires to trick the rest of the town into seeing the show. On the third night, the audience comes prepared with rotten food to throw. The king and duke escape with $465.

Huck and Jim discuss kings; Huck explains that all kings are ""rapscallions."" Jim shares a poignant story of accidentally mistreating his deaf daughter, 'Lizabeth, which fills him with remorse.

The con men continue their schemes. To allow Jim to travel during the day without suspicion, the ""duke"" dresses him as a ""Sick Arab"" with a blue-painted face and a sign. They hear about the death of Peter Wilks, a rich man, and the expected arrival of his two English brothers, Harvey and William. The ""king"" and ""duke"" decide to impersonate the brothers. The ""king"" pumps a young man for details about the Wilks family and their inheritance.

They arrive in town, the ""king"" pretending to be Harvey Wilks and the ""duke"" pretending to be the deaf and dumb William. They put on a dramatic display of grief, convincing most of the town and the three Wilks nieces: Mary Jane, Susan, and Joanna (the hare-lip). Peter Wilks's will leaves the house and $3,000 to the girls, and the tanyard, other land, and $3,000 to Harvey and William. The will also states $6,000 in cash is hidden in the cellar. The ""king"" and ""duke"" retrieve the money, find it's $415 short, and make up the difference from their own funds to maintain the illusion. They then dramatically give the entire $6,000 to the nieces.

Dr. Robinson, a local physician, immediately recognizes the ""king's"" poor English accent as fake and denounces them as frauds. Mary Jane, however, defiantly gives the money back to the ""king,"" trusting him. Huck feels terrible about the girls being swindled and resolves to steal the money back. He finds the ""king"" and ""duke"" hiding the money in the straw tick of their bed. He steals it and hides it in Peter Wilks's coffin, just before the funeral.

At the funeral, a dog howling in the cellar interrupts the sermon. The undertaker silently goes to the cellar, a whack is heard, and he returns to whisper, ""_He had a rat!_"" The undertaker then screws down the coffin lid, leaving Huck unsure if the money is still inside.

The ""king"" announces he and ""William"" must return to England and will take the girls with them, planning to auction off the remaining property. He sells Peter's enslaved family, separating a mother from her children, which causes distress in the town and among the nieces. Huck is sickened but knows the sale is invalid.

The ""king"" and ""duke"" realize the $6,000 is missing and accuse Huck. Huck deflects the blame onto the enslaved people. The con men then accuse each other of stealing and hiding the money, with the ""king"" eventually admitting he hid it.

Just before the auction, two new men arrive, one with a broken arm, claiming to be the real Harvey and William Wilks. Dr. Robinson and Levi Bell, the lawyer, are present. The town is confused. Hines, a local, testifies he saw the ""king"" (fake Harvey) in a canoe with Huck. The lawyer tests the ""king"" and ""duke"" by asking them to write, which they do poorly. The real Harvey explains his brother William (the one with the broken arm) is deaf and mute and writes for him. The lawyer is still unsure. The real Harvey asks the ""king"" what was tattooed on Peter Wilks's breast. The ""king"" guesses a ""blue arrow."" The men who laid out the body deny seeing it. The real Harvey states the tattoo was ""P—B—W."" The men who laid out the body deny seeing any marks.

The crowd, furious, decides to dig up the corpse. They march to the graveyard. During the exhumation, a lightning flash reveals the bag of gold on Peter Wilks's breast. In the ensuing chaos, Huck escapes. He makes his way back to the raft and Jim.

As they are escaping, the ""king"" and ""duke"" catch up to them in a skiff. Huck invents a story about how he escaped from the mob. The con men argue again about who hid the money in the coffin, with the ""king"" finally confessing.

The con men continue their schemes, but their luck runs out. They are tarred and feathered by a mob for their ""Royal Nonesuch"" fraud. Huck and Tom Sawyer (who has arrived at the Phelps's, where Huck is mistaken for him) witness this.

Huck, pretending to be Tom, and Tom, pretending to be his own brother Sid, devise an elaborate plan to ""steal"" Jim from the Phelps's cabin. Tom insists on making the escape as difficult and adventurous as possible, drawing inspiration from prison-escape novels. They dig a tunnel with case-knives (later picks), make a rope ladder from sheets (smuggled in a pie), craft pens from a spoon and candlestick, and carve inscriptions and a coat of arms onto a grindstone. They also fill Jim's cabin with rats, snakes, and spiders as ""pets."" They steal candles, spoons, and a sheet, confusing Aunt Sally. They send anonymous warning letters to the Phelps family, culminating in a letter warning of a gang of cutthroats coming to steal Jim, advising the family to ambush them.

On the night of the escape, Huck is sent to the cellar for butter and is caught by Aunt Sally, who mistakes the melting butter in his hat for his ""brains oozing out"" from brain-fever. She sends him to bed. Huck and Tom escape the house, but Tom snags his britches on a fence, making a noise. They are shot at by the waiting farmers. Tom is shot in the leg.

Huck and Jim escape with the wounded Tom. Jim refuses to go on without a doctor for Tom. Huck goes for a doctor, inventing a story about Tom accidentally shooting himself. The doctor is suspicious but agrees to help. He takes Huck's canoe, leaving Huck to wait. Huck returns to the Phelps's, where he is again mistaken for Tom. He invents another story about hunting the runaway enslaved person.

At the Phelps's, the doctor returns with Tom and Jim, who is tied up and in Aunt Sally's dress. The doctor praises Jim's loyalty and nursing skills, saying he risked his freedom to help Tom. The men, initially wanting to hang Jim, agree to chain him up until his owner arrives.

Tom, recovering, proudly recounts the entire elaborate escape plan to Aunt Sally, who is furious at their ""rapscallion"" behavior. Tom then reveals that Miss Watson died two months ago and freed Jim in her will.

Just then, Tom's Aunt Polly arrives, having traveled to investigate Aunt Sally's letters about ""Tom and Sid."" She exposes Huck's identity and confirms Jim's freedom.

In the end, Jim is freed and given forty dollars by Tom for his patience. Jim reveals that the dead man in the floating house was Pap, whom he covered to spare Huck. Tom plans more adventures among the ""Injuns."" Huck learns his $6,000 is still safe with Judge Thatcher. However, Huck declares he must ""light out for the territory ahead of the rest"" because Aunt Sally plans to adopt and ""sivilize"" him, and he ""can't stand it."""

**VOLUME ONE**

**Chapter 1: Marseilles—The Arrival**
On February 24, 1815, the three-master *Pharaon* arrives in Marseilles. Edmond Dantès, the young (18-20 years old) and highly capable first mate, is steering the vessel. The ship's owner, M. Morrel, comes aboard and learns that Captain Leclere died of brain-fever during the voyage. Dantès assures Morrel the cargo is safe and mentions he followed Captain Leclere's dying instructions to deliver a packet to Marshal Bertrand at the Island of Elba, where he briefly spoke with the Emperor (Napoleon). Morrel is pleased with Dantès's performance and intends to promote him to captain, pending his partner's approval. Danglars, the supercargo, a man of unprepossessing countenance and envious nature, expresses his dislike for Dantès to Morrel, accusing him of arrogance and delaying the voyage for a whim at Elba. Danglars also hints that Captain Leclere entrusted Dantès with a letter for Morrel, which Dantès did not deliver. Dantès asks for leave to marry his betrothed, Mercédès, and to go to Paris for Captain Leclere's commission. Morrel grants it, reiterating that the *Pharaon* awaits its captain. Danglars watches Dantès leave with a look of hate.

**Chapter 2: Father and Son**
Edmond rushes to his father's small apartment, finding the old man frail and overjoyed but also starving. His father reveals he spent the 200 francs Edmond left him to pay off a debt to their neighbor, Caderousse. Edmond, distressed, gives his father all his current money. Caderousse, a tailor and neighbor, soon arrives, ostensibly to congratulate Edmond. He is visibly greedy, eyeing Edmond's money. Caderousse mentions he spoke with Danglars, who inquired about Edmond. Edmond tells his father he is going to see Mercédès. After Edmond leaves, Caderousse goes to meet Danglars, who is waiting for him. They discuss Edmond's impending captaincy and marriage, with Danglars expressing strong resentment. Caderousse mentions Mercédès has many admirers. Danglars suggests they go to La Réserve to wait for news.

**Chapter 3: The Catalans**
In the Catalan village, Mercédès, a beautiful young woman, is rejecting the advances of her cousin, Fernand, who is deeply in love with her. She declares her unwavering love for Edmond and states she will only marry him. She warns Fernand that if any harm came to Edmond, she would kill herself. Edmond arrives and he and Mercédès embrace, oblivious to Fernand's dark mood. Fernand, pale and trembling, reluctantly shakes Edmond's hand and then rushes out, cursing Edmond. Fernand joins Danglars and Caderousse at La Réserve. Caderousse, now drunk, taunts Fernand about Mercédès's preference for Edmond. Danglars, observing Fernand's despair and Caderousse's loose tongue, mutters about taking action. Caderousse reveals Edmond's wedding is set for the next day. Edmond and Mercédès pass by, happy, and Edmond invites Danglars and Caderousse to the wedding feast. Edmond also mentions his trip to Paris for Captain Leclere's commission. Danglars, seeing an opportunity, thinks of the letter to Noirtier.

**Chapter 4: Conspiracy**
Danglars, exploiting Fernand's jealousy, suggests that Dantès's imprisonment, rather than death, would effectively separate him from Mercédès. Caderousse, in his drunken state, expresses reluctance to harm Dantès. Danglars then writes an anonymous denunciation with his left hand, accusing Edmond Dantès of being a Bonapartist agent carrying treasonous letters. He crumples the letter and throws it away, pretending it was a joke. Caderousse, still drunk, insists Dantès is his friend. Danglars and Caderousse leave. Fernand, who had been watching, retrieves the crumpled letter and rushes off towards the city.

**Chapter 5: The Marriage Feast**
At Edmond and Mercédès's wedding feast at La Réserve, M. Morrel confirms Dantès's promotion. Edmond and Mercédès arrive, radiating happiness, followed by a sinister-looking Fernand. Edmond announces the marriage will take place in an hour and a half. Danglars and Fernand are visibly agitated. Caderousse, softened by the festivities, expresses regret to Danglars about their ""trick."" Suddenly, a magistrate and soldiers arrive and arrest Edmond Dantès as a Bonapartist agent. Edmond is confused. M. Morrel tries to intervene, but the magistrate is firm. Old Dantès is distraught. Caderousse, realizing the gravity of the situation, accuses Danglars of orchestrating the arrest. Danglars denies it, claiming he destroyed the letter. Fernand has disappeared. Edmond is taken away, shouting a farewell to Mercédès. M. Morrel leaves to seek information from M. de Villefort. Mercédès and old Dantès collapse in grief. M. Morrel returns, confirming the Bonapartist accusation. Caderousse is about to expose Danglars but is silenced by Danglars's warning of complicity. Fernand reappears and leads Mercédès home. Danglars, now temporary commander of the *Pharaon*, is pleased.

**Chapter 6: The Deputy Procureur du Roi**
M. de Villefort, the ambitious and staunchly royalist Deputy Procureur du Roi, is at his own wedding feast. He is engaged to Renée de Saint-Méran, whose family holds political influence. A servant interrupts the celebration with news of an urgent matter. Villefort returns, beaming, announcing the discovery of a Bonapartist conspiracy. He reads the anonymous denunciation against Edmond Dantès, which is identical to the one Danglars wrote. Renée, concerned, pleads for mercy for the accused, but Villefort, driven by ambition, states he will be severe if the charges are true.

**Chapter 7: The Examination**
Villefort interrogates Edmond Dantès. Despite an initial favorable impression of Dantès's innocence and sincerity, Villefort maintains a severe demeanor. Dantès calmly explains his loyalties and the circumstances of his stop at Elba: he delivered a packet from Captain Leclere to Marshal Bertrand and received a letter for a M. Noirtier in Paris. Villefort is horrified, realizing ""Noirtier"" is his own father, a prominent Jacobin and Bonapartist. To protect his family name and his career, Villefort destroys the incriminating letter in front of Dantès and instructs him to deny all knowledge of it, promising his release. Dantès is then led away by a police agent. Villefort, seeing an opportunity to advance his career, rushes to his betrothed.

**Chapter 8: The Château d’If**
Dantès is taken to a prison and then transferred to the Château d’If. He attempts to escape by jumping into the sea but is restrained by gendarmes. Imprisoned in a dungeon, he initially holds onto hope from Villefort's promise. He asks to see the governor, but the jailer refuses, mentioning a previous prisoner in that cell, an abbé, who went mad claiming a treasure. In despair, Dantès threatens the jailer, who, fearing for his life, reports it. Dantès is then moved to a deeper, more isolated dungeon for ""madmen.""

**Chapter 9: The Evening of the Betrothal**
Villefort, having returned to the Saint-Méran's, announces he must leave for Paris immediately. He persuades the Marquis to write a letter to his broker to sell all his funds, fearing a political shift. He also secures a letter to King Louis XVIII to gain immediate audience, planning to capitalize on his ""discovery"" of the Bonapartist plot. Outside his house, Villefort encounters Mercédès, who anxiously asks about Edmond. He coldly dismisses her, stating Edmond is a criminal and he doesn't know his whereabouts. Overwhelmed by remorse but driven by ambition, Villefort departs for Paris. Meanwhile, Mercédès is in deep despair, while Fernand is with her, though she is oblivious to his presence. M. Morrel, having tried and failed to help Dantès, returns home in despair. Caderousse is uneasy, but Danglars is content, having eliminated a rival and secured his position.

**Chapter 10: The King’s Closet at the Tuileries**
In the King's closet at the Tuileries, Louis XVIII dismisses M. de Blacas's concerns about Napoleon. M. Dandré, the minister of police, confirms Napoleon is ""mortally wearied"" at Elba. Louis XVIII mocks these reports. M. de Blacas insists on the seriousness of the situation and recommends Villefort, who has urgent information. Villefort is introduced and informs the King of a serious conspiracy: Napoleon is arming ships and planning a landing. He states he arrested a sailor (Dantès) carrying an oral message to a Bonapartist in Paris. Villefort emphasizes his loyalty and sacrifice, having left his betrothal. Louis XVIII, though initially skeptical, promises gratitude.

**Chapter 11: The Corsican Ogre**
M. Dandré returns, pale and trembling, announcing Napoleon has landed in France. Louis XVIII is furious at his ministers' incompetence. Villefort, seizing the moment, suggests raising loyal provinces against Napoleon. M. Dandré reports Napoleon is advancing rapidly. Villefort reveals that Dauphiné is Bonapartist. The King, devastated, laments his fate. Villefort, to avoid making an enemy of the police minister, attributes his foresight to chance. Louis XVIII dismisses Blacas and Dandré, giving Villefort the cross of the Legion of Honor. The King then questions Dandré about the death of General Quesnel, believing it was a Bonapartist assassination. Dandré describes the suspect. Villefort is terrified, realizing the description matches his father, Noirtier. Noirtier then appears, confirming he was the president of the Bonapartist club and involved in Quesnel's death. He disguises himself and advises Villefort to keep their meeting secret. Villefort, agitated, disposes of his father's old clothes and leaves for Marseilles.

**Chapter 12: Father and Son**
This chapter is a continuation of the previous one, detailing the conversation between Villefort and his father, Noirtier. Noirtier, who matches the description of the man sought by the police, reveals he was the president of the Bonapartist club and was involved in General Quesnel's death. He explains it as a political act. Noirtier, aware of Villefort's ambition, disguises himself by cutting his whiskers and changing his clothes to evade the police. He advises Villefort to keep their encounter secret and return to Marseilles, remaining quiet about the events. Villefort, terrified of the implications for his career, agrees and disposes of his father's compromising items before leaving Paris.

**Chapter 13: The Hundred Days**
Napoleon's return (the Hundred Days) unfolds as Noirtier predicted. Villefort retains his position due to Noirtier's influence, but his marriage is postponed. M. Morrel, now a Bonapartist, tries to secure Dantès's release. Villefort, pretending to help, dictates a petition exaggerating Dantès's Bonapartist activities, but secretly retains it to use against Dantès if the Bourbons return. After Waterloo, Louis XVIII is restored. Villefort, seeking to escape the painful memories of Marseilles, is transferred to Toulouse and marries Renée. Dantès remains imprisoned. Danglars, fearing Dantès's vengeance, leaves Marseilles, finds employment in a Spanish bank, and becomes wealthy. Fernand joins the army. Old Dantès dies of starvation in Mercédès's arms. Mercédès, in despair, contemplates suicide but is restrained by her faith.

**Chapter 14: The Two Prisoners**
In 1816, an inspector-general visits the Château d'If. Dantès, now known as ""Number 34,"" pleads for a trial, stating he was imprisoned on February 28, 1815. The inspector notes Dantès's previous attempt to kill a turnkey and his perceived madness. The prison register contains a note (added later in Villefort's hand) labeling Dantès a ""Violent Bonapartist"" and ordering strict confinement. The inspector writes ""Nothing to be done."" Dantès, now aware of the date, begins marking time. The inspector then visits ""Number 27,"" the Abbé Faria, who is considered mad for claiming to possess an immense treasure. Faria tries to tell the inspector about his treasure, but the inspector dismisses him as insane.

**Chapter 15: Number 34 and Number 27**
Dantès endures extreme despair and contemplates suicide by starvation. He then hears a scratching sound in the wall, deducing it's another prisoner. He communicates with the unseen prisoner by knocking. The voice belongs to the Abbé Faria. They exchange stories: Dantès's imprisonment for aiding Napoleon, and Faria's imprisonment since 1811 for political reasons. Faria reveals he was attempting to dig an escape tunnel but miscalculated, ending up near Dantès's cell. Dantès, inspired by Faria's intellect and courage, vows to be his son and help him. Faria, now paralyzed from a catalepsy attack, instructs Dantès on how to administer a life-saving elixir. Dantès saves Faria, who then tells him he must escape alone. Dantès refuses to leave him. Faria promises to reveal something important the next day.

**Chapter 16: A Learned Italian**
Faria explains his escape attempt, revealing he made tools from his bedstead and used a complex calculation. He shows Dantès his manuscript, ""A Treatise on the Possibility of a General Monarchy in Italy,"" written on shirts with a fish-bone pen and soot-ink. He reveals his vast knowledge of languages and literature. Dantès, amazed, asks Faria to help him understand his own past. Faria, using the principle ""seek whom the crime will profit,"" helps Dantès deduce that Danglars wrote the anonymous denunciation, Fernand posted it, and Villefort (whose father is Noirtier, the recipient of the letter) destroyed the evidence to protect his own career. Dantès is filled with a desire for vengeance. Faria, now partially paralyzed, teaches Dantès everything he knows. After 15 months, their new escape tunnel is complete. Faria suffers a third, fatal catalepsy attack. He blesses Dantès and dies, urging him to remember ""Monte Cristo."" Dantès, in a desperate plan, swaps places with Faria's corpse.

**Chapter 17: The Abbé’s Chamber**
This chapter details Faria's revelations to Dantès about his past and the treasure. Faria shows Dantès his homemade tools, ink, and paper, and explains his method of telling time. He recounts his political ambitions to unify Italy, which led to his imprisonment. Dantès then tells Faria his own story, from his betrothal to his arrest. Faria, using his deductive reasoning, identifies Danglars, Fernand, and Villefort as the perpetrators of Dantès's misfortune. He reveals that Villefort destroyed the incriminating letter because it was addressed to his own father, Noirtier. Dantès is filled with a desire for vengeance. Faria begins teaching Dantès various subjects. After a year, Dantès is transformed. Faria suffers a third, paralyzing attack and, believing he will die, reveals the secret of the Spada treasure, hidden on the Island of Monte Cristo. He gives Dantès a fragmented will, which, when pieced together, details the treasure's location. Faria gives Dantès the treasure, calling him his son.

**Chapter 18: The Treasure**
Faria, now fully convinced of Dantès's loyalty, reveals the complete secret of the Spada treasure, hidden on the Island of Monte Cristo. He gives Dantès the two fragments of Cardinal Spada's will, which, when combined, describe the location of a fortune of nearly two million Roman crowns (thirteen million francs). Dantès is initially incredulous but is convinced by Faria's detailed explanation. Faria, now too weak to escape himself, instructs Dantès on how to find and recover the treasure, making him memorize the will.

**Chapter 19: The Third Attack**
Faria suffers his final, fatal catalepsy attack. In his dying moments, he urges Dantès to escape and use the treasure for good, but Dantès is now consumed by thoughts of vengeance. Faria dies, repeating ""Monte Cristo."" Dantès, in a desperate act, swaps places with Faria's body in the burial sack, planning to escape the Château d'If. The jailers, finding Faria's body (believing it to be Dantès), prepare it for burial at sea, attaching a 36-pound cannonball to its feet.

**Chapter 20: The Cemetery of the Château d’If**
Dantès, inside the burial sack, is thrown into the sea. He uses a knife (made by Faria) to cut himself free from the sack and the cannonball. He swims to the surface, seeing the Château d'If and two figures with a torch looking towards the sea. He dives to avoid detection.

**Chapter 21: The Island of Tiboulen**
Dantès swims towards the nearest islands. He is caught in a storm and witnesses a fishing boat wreck. He devises a plan to pose as a shipwrecked sailor. He finds a red cap and timber from the wreck. He is rescued by the Genoese smuggling vessel, *La Jeune Amélie*. He tells the crew a fabricated story of his shipwreck. He demonstrates his superior sailing skills, impressing the captain, Gaetano, and a sailor named Jacopo. He learns it is February 28, 1829, exactly 14 years since his arrest. He is 33 years old. He renews his oath of vengeance against Danglars, Fernand, and Villefort.

The *La Jeune Amélie* successfully completes a smuggling run. Dantès tests Jacopo's loyalty. The captain proposes a new operation, using the deserted Island of Monte Cristo as a rendezvous point. Dantès, seeing his opportunity, agrees.

**Chapter 23: The Island of Monte Cristo**
The *La Jeune Amélie* sails to Monte Cristo. Dantès, feigning injury, convinces his companions to leave him on the island with provisions and a pickaxe. Once alone, he finds the hidden entrance to the Spada treasure, following the clues from Faria's will. He uses gunpowder to blast away a rock, revealing an iron ring. He lifts a flagstone, descends into a grotto, and finds the oaken coffer containing immense wealth: gold ingots, coins, diamonds, pearls, and rubies. Overwhelmed, he prays and then secures the treasure.

**Chapter 24: The Secret Cave**
This chapter provides a detailed account of Dantès's discovery and securing of the treasure on Monte Cristo. He spends a week studying the island and his new yacht. Jacopo returns with the devastating news that Edmond's father is dead and Mercédès has disappeared. Dantès, outwardly calm, is deeply affected. He gives Jacopo a new fishing boat and money, instructing him to inquire further about his father and Mercédès in Marseilles and then return to Monte Cristo. Dantès purchases a magnificent yacht in Genoa, has secret compartments built, and transfers his treasure into them. He then sails to Marseilles, disguised as ""Lord Wilmore,"" an English nobleman. He tests his disguise on a former crew member, who doesn't recognize him. He visits his father's old house, now occupied by a young couple, and buys the property, granting the tenants free rent in other rooms. He learns Caderousse is an innkeeper. He leaves Marseilles, his mind set on vengeance.

Morrel (ruined) and the immense wealth and social standing of Danglars (now Baron Danglars) and Fernand (now Count of Morcerf). Caderousse mentions Mercédès is now the Countess de Morcerf but is unhappy. The Abbé then reveals that Edmond Dantès, on his deathbed, bequeathed a diamond worth 50,000 francs to his friends, including Caderousse. The Abbé gives the diamond to Caderousse, taking in return the red silk purse M. Morrel had left for old Dantès.

Morrel's financial state, claiming his firm has a large loan with Morrel. He offers to buy Boville's credit for 200,000 francs. As a ""commission,"" he asks to see the prison registers. Boville recounts the story of the mad Abbé Faria and the dangerous Bonapartist Edmond Dantès, explaining how Dantès swapped places with Faria's corpse and was thrown into the sea.

Villefort, recognizing him, drags Monte Cristo to the bodies of his wife and child, asking, ""See, are you well avenged?"" Monte Cristo is horrified, realizing he has ""passed beyond the bounds of vengeance."" He tries to revive Edward but fails. Villefort, completely mad, runs into the garden with a spade, digging furiously, crying, ""It is not here!"" Monte Cristo, doubting his right to have caused such suffering, leaves the house.

**Chapter 112: The Departure**
Emmanuel and Julie discuss the recent misfortunes of Morcerf, Danglars, and Villefort. Monte Cristo arrives to take Maximilian with him. Maximilian, still in a state of apathy, agrees to go. Monte Cristo bids Julie and Emmanuel farewell, implying he will not return. He leaves with Maximilian. At Villejuif, Monte Cristo stops the carriage and reflects on his mission of vengeance in Paris, concluding his work is accomplished. They arrive in Marseilles, where they see Albert de Morcerf embarking on a ship for Algiers. Monte Cristo points out Mercédès, veiled, waving goodbye to Albert. Monte Cristo then visits Mercédès in her humble house. Mercédès confesses her guilt and self-blame for Edmond's past suffering and Fernand's actions. Monte Cristo reveals he was an ""agent of vengeance"" and that God needed him to live. Mercédès asks for her son's happiness, which Monte Cristo promises to promote. She accepts the 3,000 francs (Edmond's buried treasure) as her dowry, intending to live in prayer. Monte Cristo leaves, murmuring Haydée's name, having overcome his doubts.

**Chapter 113: The Past**
Monte Cristo, with a sad heart, leaves Mercédès, questioning the extent of his vengeance. He revisits the Château d'If, where the concierge recounts the story of the ""dangerous prisoner"" (Dantès) and the ""mad priest"" (Faria), including Dantès's escape by swapping bodies. Monte Cristo is deeply affected, feeling his ""wound reopens"" and his heart ""thirsts for vengeance"" again. The concierge also shows him Faria's manuscript, ""A Treatise on the Possibility of a General Monarchy in Italy,"" with its epigraph: ""Thou shalt tear out the dragons' teeth, and shall trample the lions under foot, saith the Lord."" Monte Cristo sees this as his answer and a confirmation of his divine mission. He gives the concierge a large sum of money. He then visits his father's grave, which is gone. He finds Maximilian Morrel at his parents' grave, still grieving Valentine. Monte Cristo tells Maximilian a story of a man who suffered more than him (Dantès). He instructs Maximilian to meet him on the Island of Monte Cristo on October 5th, promising a yacht will take him there. Monte Cristo then leaves for Italy.

**Chapter 114: Peppino**
Danglars, fleeing Paris, travels to Rome. He visits Thomson & French, his bankers, to draw money. Peppino, a bandit, observes him. Peppino learns Danglars has drawn 5 million francs. Danglars leaves the bank and is followed by Peppino. Danglars is intercepted by Vampa's men on the Appian Way and imprisoned in the Catacombs of Saint Sebastian, in the same cell Albert was held in. Danglars recognizes Vampa and realizes he is being held for ransom.

**Chapter 115: Luigi Vampa’s Bill of Fare**
Danglars, imprisoned, is systematically extorted by Peppino and Vampa for food and drink. He is forced to pay exorbitant prices (100,000 francs for a fowl, then for a loaf of bread) by writing drafts on Thomson & French. He realizes they intend to take all his money.

**Chapter 116: The Pardon**
Danglars continues to be extorted, his fortune dwindling. He is reduced to his last 50,000 francs. He is delirious from hunger and despair. He begs Peppino for food. Luigi Vampa appears and demands the remaining 5 million francs. Danglars offers less, but Vampa refuses, stating he is forbidden to shed blood but not to let him starve. Danglars, in utter despair, refuses to sign any more drafts. After days of starvation, he offers his last money. Vampa asks if he repents. Danglars says yes. The Count of Monte Cristo appears, revealing his true identity: Edmond Dantès. Dantès tells Danglars that his accomplices (Fernand and Villefort) are punished. He gives Danglars the remaining 50,000 francs, revealing that the 5 million Danglars stole from hospitals has been restored. Dantès orders Vampa to free Danglars after he has eaten. Danglars is left by the roadside, his hair turned white from terror and suffering.

**Chapter 117: The Fifth of October**
On October 5th, Maximilian Morrel arrives at Monte Cristo. He is still in deep despair and intends to commit suicide. Monte Cristo, now calm, tries to console him. Maximilian reminds the Count of his promise to provide pistols and poison if he is not consoled. The Count leads Maximilian into a luxurious grotto. He offers Maximilian a greenish, unctuous substance from a golden box, calling it a ""remedy."" Maximilian takes it, believing it to be a sweet means of death. He feels a delicious torpor. The Count then opens a hidden door, revealing Valentine, alive and well, with Haydée. Maximilian, overwhelmed, falls to his knees. The Count explains he saved Valentine from death, and now they will be reunited. He states he vanquished death and that God has accepted his atonement. Valentine and Haydée express their love and gratitude. The Count asks Valentine to treat Haydée as a sister, as he will be leaving. Haydée, hearing this, is distraught, saying she will die if he leaves her. The Count realizes Haydée loves him. He embraces her, saying her love makes him forget his past suffering. The Count gives Maximilian a letter. The letter reveals that the Count is Edmond Dantès. He has left Maximilian his grotto, his house in the Champs-Élysées, and his château at Tréport as wedding gifts for him and Valentine. He asks Valentine to give her father's (now mad) and brother's (dead) immense fortune to the poor. He tells Maximilian that true happiness comes from having experienced deep grief, and that all human wisdom is summed up in two words: ""Wait and hope."" The Count and Haydée depart on the yacht *Eurus*. Maximilian and Valentine are reunited and look towards the horizon, repeating ""Wait and hope."""
The Decameron-Giovanni Boccaccio,"The Decameron begins with a **Proem** where the author, Giovanni Boccaccio, reflects on his past suffering from a high and noble passion and the comfort he received from a friend's discourse. Now free from that affliction, he wishes to offer solace to others, particularly lovesick ladies, who are often confined and lack diversions compared to men. To this end, he purposes to recount one hundred stories over ten days, told by an honorable company of seven ladies and three young men, formed during the late deadly pestilence. These stories will contain both joyful and grievous love-chances and other accidents of fortune, offering both solace and useful counsel.

**Day the First**

The author introduces the setting: Florence in 1348, afflicted by the devastating Black Death. He describes the horrifying symptoms (plague-boils, black blotches) and the rapid, almost inevitable death that followed. The plague was highly contagious, even affecting animals through contact with the sick. This led to a breakdown of social order and laws. People reacted in various ways: some isolated themselves in luxury, others indulged in unrestrained revelry, some lived moderately, and many fled the city. Family bonds dissolved, with parents abandoning sick children. The dead were buried hastily in mass graves. The countryside also suffered, with abandoned crops and livestock. Over 100,000 people perished in Florence.

One Tuesday morning, seven young ladies, aged eighteen to twenty-eight, all discreet, noble, fair, and lively, met in the venerable church of Santa Maria Novella. Their names are Pampinea, Fiammetta, Filomena, Emilia, Lauretta, Neifile, and Elisa. Pampinea proposes that they leave the afflicted city for the countryside to preserve their lives and spirits. Filomena agrees but suggests they need male guidance, as women alone are ""fickle, wilful, suspicious, faint-hearted and timorous."" Elisa supports this, but wonders how to find suitable men, as most of their kinsmen have fled.

Just then, three young men, Pamfilo, Filostrato, and Dioneo, enter the church, seeking their beloveds (who are among the ladies). Pampinea, related to one of them, suggests they invite the men to join their company. Neifile expresses concern about scandal due to their known affections, but Filomena dismisses this, asserting that honest living will protect their reputation. The other ladies agree. Pampinea invites the young men to join them in a ""pure and brotherly spirit,"" which they joyfully accept.

The next morning (Wednesday), the ten depart Florence with their servants and arrive at a beautiful palace on a little hill, with gardens, wells, and fine wines. Dioneo urges merriment, and Pampinea proposes they elect a leader daily to maintain order and joy. They elect Pampinea as their first queen, crowning her with a laurel wreath. She assigns duties to the servants and dismisses the company to enjoy the gardens. After dinner, they dance and sing. In the afternoon, Pampinea proposes telling stories to pass the hot hours. The theme for the first day is ""that which is most agreeable unto each."" Pamfilo is chosen to tell the first story.

**The Stories of Day the First:**

1.  **Master Ciappelletto:** Pamfilo tells of Master Ciappelletto da Prato, a notoriously wicked man (false witness, blasphemer, murderer, gambler, glutton) who is hired by Musciatto Franzesi to collect debts in Burgundy. Falling mortally ill at the home of two Florentine brothers, Ciappelletto, to prevent scandal for his hosts (who fear his unconfessed death will lead to their ruin), feigns a confession to a holy friar. He fabricates a life of extreme piety, virginity, fasting, charity, and righteous anger, even confessing minor, fabricated sins like cursing his mother or spitting in church with exaggerated remorse. The friar, completely deceived, believes him a saint. After his death, the friar preaches his supposed sanctity, and Ciappelletto is buried with great honor, becoming ""Saint Ciappelletto,"" with people believing he performs miracles. Pamfilo concludes that God, in His benignity, responds to the purity of the suppliant's intent, even if the intercessor is a reprobate.
2.  **Abraham the Jew:** Neifile recounts Jehannot de Chevigné, a Parisian merchant, who tries to convert his friend, Abraham the Jew. Abraham agrees to consider Christianity only after visiting Rome to observe the Pope and clergy. Jehannot is dismayed, fearing Abraham will be disgusted by the corrupt Roman court. Abraham goes, witnesses the widespread lust, gluttony, avarice, and simony among the clergy, but returns convinced that Christianity must be divinely supported to thrive despite such depravity. He converts, is baptized Giovanni, and lives a devout life.
3.  **Melchizedek the Jew:** Filomena tells of Saladin, who, needing money, seeks to extort it from the rich but miserly Jew, Melchizedek. Saladin asks Melchizedek which of the three laws (Jewish, Saracen, Christian) is the true one, hoping to trap him. Melchizedek, perceiving the snare, replies with the ""Story of the Three Rings"": A rich man had a precious ring he promised to the son who would inherit his estate. Having three equally beloved sons, he secretly had two identical rings made, giving one to each. After his death, the true heir could not be determined. Melchizedek concludes that, similarly, the truth of the three laws remains pending. Saladin, impressed, reveals his need, and Melchizedek freely lends him money, becoming his friend and advisor.
4.  **A Monk and the Abbot:** Dioneo narrates a story of a young, lusty monk in Lunigiana who brings a beautiful country lass to his cell. The abbot, passing by, hears them and spies on them, discovering their secret. The monk, realizing he's been caught, locks the girl in his cell and gives the key to the abbot, feigning a trip to the woods. The abbot, intending to expose the monk, enters the cell alone. Seeing the beautiful girl, he is overcome by lust and seduces her himself. The monk, who had hidden and observed the abbot, then confronts him. The abbot, ashamed of his own transgression, pardons the monk and they secretly release the girl, agreeing to keep silent.
5.  **The Marchioness of Monferrato:** Fiammetta tells of the Marquis of Monferrato, away on a crusade. King Philippe le Borgne of France, hearing of the Marchioness's beauty, detours to visit her, intending to seduce her. The Marchioness, discerning his intent, prepares a magnificent dinner consisting solely of various dishes made from hens. When the King, noticing the lack of other game, asks if only hens are born in her lands, she wittily replies that women, though differing in attire, are all of the same fashion everywhere. The King understands her meaning (that she is a ""hen,"" not a ""cock,"" and will not be easily taken), is shamed, and departs without pursuing his desire.
6.  **An Honest Man and the Inquisitor:** Emilia recounts a Minor Friar, an inquisitor, who is more interested in money than faith. He prosecutes a simple rich man for saying his wine was so good ""Christ himself might drink thereof."" The inquisitor threatens him with fire, but the man ""greases his palm"" with money. As penance, he is made to wear a yellow cross and attend mass daily. Hearing a Gospel verse about receiving ""an hundredfold,"" the man tells the inquisitor he pities him and his brethren, as they will drown in broth in the afterlife, given how much superfluous broth they give to the poor. The inquisitor, angered by the public rebuke of his gluttony, dismisses him.
7.  **Bergamino and Messer Cane della Scala:** Filostrato tells of Messer Cane della Scala, a magnificent nobleman who suddenly becomes niggardly, dismissing his court except for Bergamino, a witty entertainer. Bergamino, running out of money and clothes, subtly rebukes Messer Cane by telling a story. He recounts Primasso, a learned grammarian, who, finding himself poor, visits the generous Abbot of Cluny. The Abbot, seeing Primasso poorly dressed, becomes uncharacteristically miserly and refuses to serve him food. Primasso, having brought three cakes of bread, eats them one by one. The Abbot, observing this, realizes his own uncharacteristic avarice and, upon learning Primasso's identity, is ashamed. He then treats Primasso magnificently. Messer Cane, understanding the allegory, laughs, acknowledges his fault, and generously rewards Bergamino.
8.  **Guglielmo Borsiere and Messer Ermino:** Lauretta tells of Messer Ermino de' Grimaldi, a notoriously avaricious Genoese merchant. Guglielmo Borsiere, a worthy minstrel, visits Genoa and, hearing of Ermino's miserliness, desires to see him. Ermino, having some breeding, receives him courteously and shows him his new house, asking what unique thing he could have painted in his saloon. Guglielmo replies, ""Cause Liberality to be here depictured."" Ermino is so shamed that he changes his ways, becoming the most liberal gentleman in Genoa.
9.  **The King of Cyprus and the Gascon Lady:** Elisa recounts a story from the time of the first King of Cyprus. A Gascon lady, returning from a pilgrimage, is shamefully abused. The King, known for his pusillanimity in enduring insults, offers no redress. The lady, despairing of justice, decides to rebuke the King's weakness. She tearfully tells him she doesn't seek redress for her wrong, but asks him to teach her how he endures the many affronts offered to himself, so she might learn to bear her own. The King, shamed by her words, awakens from his sluggishness, cruelly avenges her wrong, and thenceforth becomes a rigorous prosecutor of all who offend his crown.
10. **Master Alberto of Bologna:** Pampinea concludes the day with the story of Master Alberto, a famous Bolognese physician, nearly seventy, who falls in love with the beautiful widow Madam Malgherida de' Ghisolieri. He constantly passes by her house, becoming the subject of amusement for her and other ladies. One day, they invite him in and mockingly ask why he, an old man, loves her when many young men do. Master Alberto wittily replies that he is like someone who eats the good head of a leek, while others eat the bad leaves. He implies that he, with his experience, knows how to appreciate true beauty and love, while the young men are foolish. The lady and her companions are abashed and commend his wit, accepting his love respectfully.

**Day the First - Conclusion:**

The sun begins to set. Pampinea, her term as queen ending, crowns Filomena, who blushes but accepts. Filomena confirms the existing servant assignments and proposes a new theme for the next day: ""OF THOSE WHO AFTER BEING BAFFLED BY DIVERS CHANCES HAVE WON AT LAST TO A JOYFUL ISSUE BEYOND THEIR HOPE."" Dioneo requests the privilege of telling any story he likes, regardless of the theme, and to speak last. The queen grants this. They then go to a stream, bathe, and return for supper, followed by dancing and singing. Emilia sings a song about her self-love and contentment, which the others join. They retire for the night.

**Day the Second**

The next morning, the company enjoys the gardens, weaving garlands and singing. After eating, dancing, and resting, they gather by the fountain. Filomena, as queen, commands Neifile to begin the day's stories.

**The Stories of Day the Second:**

1.  **Martellino:** Neifile tells of Martellino, a Florentine entertainer, who, with two companions (Stecchi and Marchese), visits Treviso during a public veneration of ""Saint Arrigo."" To get through the crowd, Martellino feigns being a cripple, is carried to the saint's body, and then dramatically ""recovers."" A Florentine recognizes him, exposing the fraud. Martellino is beaten by the furious crowd. Marchese, to save him, falsely accuses Martellino of being a cutpurse. Martellino is arrested and tortured by a cruel judge. His companions find a local influential man who intervenes with the Prince. Martellino is brought before the Prince, explains his prank, and is released with his friends, receiving new clothes.
2.  **Rinaldo d'Asti:** Filostrato tells of Rinaldo d'Asti, a merchant returning home, who joins company with highwaymen disguised as merchants. Rinaldo tells them he always says a prayer to St. Julian for good lodging. The highwaymen rob him, leaving him in his shirt and barefoot in the snow near Castel Guglielmo. He cannot enter the closed town gates. He finds shelter under a house projection. Inside, a widow lady, mistress of the Marquis Azzo, has prepared a bath and supper for the Marquis, who unexpectedly cancels. Hearing Rinaldo's cries, she sends her maid, takes pity on him, lets him in, and has him bathe. She is attracted to him, and they spend the night together. The next morning, she gives him clothes and money. Miraculously, the highwaymen who robbed him are caught, and his belongings are returned. Rinaldo returns home rich and safe.
3.  **Alessandro:** Pampinea tells of three Florentine brothers (Lamberto, Tedaldo, Agolante) who squander their inheritance, then become usurers in England. They send their nephew, Alessandro, to manage their affairs there. War breaks out, and Alessandro loses everything. Returning home in despair, he encounters an abbot, who is actually the King of England's daughter, fleeing an unwanted marriage. She is captivated by Alessandro and, after discovering her true identity to him, marries him in secret before a picture of Christ. In Rome, she reveals herself to the Pope, who, after some appeasement, formally marries them. They return to Florence, where she frees his imprisoned uncles and restores their wealth. Alessandro is knighted and made Earl of Cornwall, reconciling the King of England with his son.
4.  **Landolfo Ruffolo:** Lauretta tells of Landolfo Ruffolo, a rich Ravello merchant who loses his wealth in trade in Cyprus. He turns corsair, plundering Turkish vessels, and becomes even richer. On his way home, his ship is captured by Genoese carracks, who rob him and scuttle his vessel. A storm then wreaks the carrack he is on. Landolfo saves himself on a floating chest. He drifts to Corfu, where a poor woman rescues him. The chest, which he thought worthless, is full of precious jewels. He returns home rich, sending gifts to the woman and those who helped him.
5.  **Andreuccio of Perugia:** Fiammetta tells of Andreuccio di Pietro, a horse-courser from Perugia, who goes to Naples with 500 gold florins. He foolishly displays his money. A Sicilian damsel, a courtesan, and her old maid, who knows Andreuccio's family, plot to rob him. The damsel, feigning to be his long-lost sister, lures him to her house in a disreputable street. She tells a fabricated story of their shared father, winning his trust. After supper, he goes to relieve himself, falls through a broken plank into a cesspit, and is locked out. His money is stolen. He tries to get back in, causing a commotion, and is threatened by the courtesan's bully. He flees, stinking, and encounters two thieves planning to rob the tomb of a recently buried archbishop, who was interred with a valuable ruby ring. They force Andreuccio to enter the tomb. He takes the ruby. The thieves then trap him inside. Other thieves arrive, open the tomb, and Andreuccio scares them away. He escapes with the ruby and returns to his inn, then quickly leaves Naples.
6.  **Madam Beritola:** Emilia tells of Madam Beritola Caracciola, wife of Arrighetto Capece, a supporter of King Manfred. After Manfred's defeat, Arrighetto is imprisoned. Pregnant, Beritola flees with her 8-year-old son, Giusfredi, to Lipari, where she gives birth to Scacciato. On a voyage to Naples, a storm drives them to the desert island of Ponza. While she is ashore lamenting, a pirate galley seizes her boat with her children and nurse. She lives as a wild woman on the island for months, suckling two kidlings. Currado Malespina and his wife, returning from pilgrimage, find her. She tells her story, and they take her to Lunigiana, where she serves Currado's wife, still caring for her goats. Meanwhile, her sons and nurse become slaves to Messer Guasparrino d'Oria in Genoa. The nurse, to protect the boys, renames Giusfredi ""Giannotto di Procida"" and claims they are her sons. Giannotto, now 16, leaves service and eventually becomes a servant to Currado Malespina. He falls in love with Currado's daughter, Spina, and she with him. They are caught together and imprisoned. Giannotto, hearing of the Sicilian revolt, reveals his true identity. Currado, realizing Beritola is Giannotto's mother, arranges their marriage. Scacciato is also found, marries Guasparrino's daughter, and Arrighetto Capece is freed in Sicily. The family is reunited and restored to high estate.
7.  **Alatiel:** Pamfilo tells of Alatiel, the beautiful daughter of the Soldan of Babylon, sent to marry the King of Algarve. Her ship is wrecked near Majorca. She and three of her women survive. Pericone da Visalgo, a gentleman, finds them and takes Alatiel to his castle, intending to marry or seduce her. He gets her drunk and sleeps with her. Pericone's brother, Marato, also desires her. He murders Pericone and abducts Alatiel, taking her on a ship to Chiarenza. On board, the two Genoese shipmasters fall in love with Alatiel. They murder Marato by throwing him overboard, then fight over her, killing each other. Alatiel arrives in Chiarenza with the sole surviving wounded master. The Prince of Morea, hearing of her beauty, takes her as his mistress. The Duke of Athens, the Prince's kinsman, visits and also falls in love with Alatiel. He murders the Prince and his chamberlain and abducts Alatiel to his seaside villa. The Prince's brother seeks vengeance. The Duke's wife, sister to the Emperor's son Constantine, complains about the Duke's mistress. Constantine, seeing Alatiel, also falls in love. He feigns illness, returns to Athens, and, with his sister's unwitting help, abducts Alatiel. They sail to Chios. Osbech, King of the Turks, raids Chios, captures Alatiel, and marries her. Osbech is then killed in battle, and his servant, Antiochus, with whom Alatiel has become intimate, flees with her and Osbech's treasures to Rhodes. Antiochus falls ill and, on his deathbed, entrusts Alatiel and his wealth to a Cypriot merchant. The merchant, in turn, falls in love with and sleeps with Alatiel, taking her to Cyprus as his wife. There, an old gentleman, Antigonus, recognizes her as the Soldan's daughter. She tells him a fabricated story of her misfortunes, omitting her sexual encounters. Antigonus arranges her return to her father, who, believing her still a virgin, sends her to marry the King of Algarve. She lives happily as his queen.
8.  **The Count of Antwerp:** Elisa tells of Gautier, Count of Antwerp, left as vicar general of France by the King and his son, who are at war. The King's daughter-in-law falls in love with the handsome Count and confesses her passion. He rejects her, citing loyalty to the King. Enraged, she tears her clothes and cries rape. The Count flees with his two young children, Louis (9) and Violante (7), to England, changing their names to Perrot and Jeannette. He leaves Jeannette with a noble lady in London and Perrot with a marshal in Wales, then goes to Ireland, working as a horseboy. Jeannette grows up beautiful and is loved by her mistress's son, Jamy. He falls ill from unrequited love. A physician discovers his love for Jeannette. Jamy's parents, though reluctant, agree to their marriage. Perrot, now a valiant knight, becomes marshal in Wales after a plague kills his lord. Eighteen years later, the Count returns to England, finds his children prosperous, and becomes Jamy's horseboy. The Queen of France, on her deathbed, confesses her false accusation against the Count. The King offers a reward for news of him. The Count reveals himself to Perrot and Jamy. Jamy claims the reward, presenting the Count in his horseboy attire. The King is moved, restores the Count's honors, and the family is reunited.
9.  **Ginevra:** Filomena tells of Bernabo Lomellini, a Genoese merchant, who boasts of his wife Ginevra's chastity to other merchants in Paris. Ambrogiuolo of Piacenza wagers 5,000 florins against Bernabo's 1,000 that he can seduce Ginevra. Ambrogiuolo goes to Genoa, bribes a maid to hide him in a chest in Ginevra's bedchamber. He emerges at night, observes the room, and finds a mole under Ginevra's left breast. He steals a purse, night-rail, rings, and girdles. Returning to Paris, he presents these as proof. Bernabo, convinced, orders a servant to kill Ginevra. The servant, taking pity, leaves her in a desolate valley, taking her clothes and telling Bernabo she was devoured by wolves. Ginevra disguises herself as a man, ""Sicurano da Finale,"" and takes service with a Catalan gentleman. She travels to Alexandria, where she is given to the Soldan as a gift. She rises in the Soldan's favor. At a fair in Acre, she recognizes her stolen purse and girdle with Ambrogiuolo. She artfully befriends him and brings him to Alexandria. She arranges for Bernabo to come to Alexandria. Before the Soldan, she exposes Ambrogiuolo's lie, revealing her true identity and the mole. Ambrogiuolo is condemned to a gruesome death (smeared with honey and exposed to insects). Ginevra is restored to her husband, Bernabo, who begs her forgiveness. She is given all of Ambrogiuolo's wealth and more by the Soldan, returning to Genoa rich and honored.
10. **Paganino of Monaco:** Dioneo tells of Messer Ricciardo di Chinzica, an old, rich, but sexually weak Pisan judge, who marries the beautiful young Bartolomea. He imposes a strict ""calendar"" of abstinence on her. One day, while fishing, Bartolomea is abducted by the corsair Paganino da Mare. Paganino, finding her beautiful, decides to keep her. He quickly satisfies her desires, making her forget her husband. Ricciardo, learning her whereabouts, goes to Monaco to ransom her. He befriends Paganino and asks for his wife back. Paganino agrees, but only if she willingly returns. Bartolomea, now happy with Paganino, refuses to acknowledge Ricciardo, claiming she doesn't know him. In a private conversation, she explains her former unhappiness and her current satisfaction. Ricciardo, realizing his folly, returns to Pisa, where he dies of grief. Paganino then marries Bartolomea, and they live happily.

**Day the Second - Conclusion:**

The company laughs at Dioneo's story. Filomena, her reign ending, crowns Neifile as the next queen. Neifile proposes that they observe Friday (day of Christ's passion) and Saturday (for washing and devotion to the Virgin) as days of rest from storytelling. She also suggests they move to a new location to avoid tedium and new arrivals. For Sunday, the new theme will be ""OF SUCH AS HAVE, BY DINT OF DILIGENCE, ACQUIRED SOME MUCH DESIRED THING OR RECOVERED SOME LOST GOOD."" Dioneo's privilege to tell any story last is confirmed. They enjoy the evening with music and dance, and Pampinea sings a song about her complete happiness in love. They retire, looking forward to Sunday.

**Day the Third**

On Sunday morning, the company travels to a new, magnificent palace on a knoll, with a beautiful garden, fountain, and diverse animals. After refreshments, they explore the garden, marveling at its beauty. They dine by the fountain, then some rest, while others read or play games. After their siesta, they gather by the fountain. Filostrato is chosen to tell the first story.

**The Stories of Day the Third:**

1.  **Masetto of Lamporecchio:** Filostrato tells of Masetto, a young, robust laborer who, hearing an old gardener complain about young nuns in a convent, feigns being deaf and dumb to get the gardener's job. The abbess and nuns, believing him incapable of speaking or reporting, mock him and eventually, driven by curiosity and desire, begin to seduce him one by one. The abbess herself, finding him asleep and aroused, also takes him as a lover. Masetto, overwhelmed by the demands of nine women, reveals he can speak. The abbess, realizing all the nuns are involved, agrees to keep his secret. They make him bailiff, and he continues to satisfy them discreetly. He returns home rich and a father in his old age.
2.  **King Agilulf and the Horsekeeper:** Pampinea tells of Agilulf, King of the Lombards, and his virtuous wife, Theodolinda. A handsome horsekeeper falls in love with the Queen. Observing the King's routine of visiting the Queen's chamber at night (wrapped in a mantle, with a taper and wand, striking the door twice), the horsekeeper imitates him. He successfully sleeps with the Queen, who mistakes him for her husband. The King, realizing his wife has been deceived, but not wanting to cause scandal, discreetly seeks the culprit. He goes through the sleeping servants, feeling their pulses. He finds the horsekeeper's pulse racing and, to mark him, clips a lock of his hair. The horsekeeper, realizing he's been marked, then clips the hair of all his fellow servants. The next morning, when the King summons all his household, he finds most of them with clipped hair. He understands he's been outwitted and, to avoid further scandal, dismisses them with a warning: ""Let him who did it do it no more and get you gone in peace."" The horsekeeper never repeats his act during the King's lifetime.
3.  **A Lady and the Friar:** Filomena tells of a noble, witty Florentine lady, unhappily married to a wool-monger, who falls in love with a gentleman. To communicate with him discreetly, she uses a friar, a reputed holy man who is friends with her lover. She confesses to the friar, feigning distress about the gentleman's persistent courtship, asking the friar to rebuke him. The friar, believing her, does so. The gentleman, understanding the lady's subtle message, begins to pass by her house more frequently. Later, the lady again ""confesses"" to the friar, claiming the gentleman has sent her gifts (a purse and girdle) and is more persistent. She gives the gifts to the friar to return to the gentleman. The friar, incensed, gives the gifts to the gentleman, who is overjoyed, realizing the lady's true intentions. Finally, she ""confesses"" that the gentleman tried to enter her chamber via the garden window. The friar, now furious, confronts the gentleman, who, again understanding the message, uses the garden window to meet the lady. They enjoy their love, mocking the simple friar.
4.  **Dom Felice and Fra Puccio:** Pamfilo tells of Fra Puccio, a rich but simple-minded tertiary of St. Francis, who is obsessed with religious practices. His young, beautiful wife, Isabetta, is neglected. Dom Felice, a clever young monk, becomes friends with Fra Puccio and falls in love with Isabetta.

**The Stories of Day the Sixth:**

1.  **Madam Oretta:** Filomena tells of Madam Oretta, a noble Florentine lady. A gentleman offers to ""carry her a-horseback"" with a story.

The gentleman, understanding her witty rebuke, stops the story.
2.  **Cisti the Baker:** Pampinea tells of Cisti, a rich baker with a noble spirit, who has excellent wine. Messer Geri Spina, a Florentine gentleman, and papal ambassadors pass Cisti's shop daily.

When Messer Geri hosts a banquet, he sends a servant for Cisti's wine in a large flagon. Cisti, seeing the large vessel, tells the servant Messer Geri didn't send him.

Both the Bishop and Messer Dego are shamed into silence.
4.  **Chichibio the Cook:** Neifile tells of Currado Gianfigliazzi, a noble Florentine, who catches a crane and orders his cook, Chichibio, to roast it.

Currado, enraged, threatens to punish him if he cannot prove it. The next morning, Currado takes Chichibio to a river where cranes sleep on one leg. Chichibio points them out. Currado shouts, and the cranes put down their other legs and fly away. Chichibio quickly retorts that Currado didn't shout at the crane last night. Currado, amused, forgives him.
5.  **Messer Forese da Rabatta and Master Giotto:** Pamfilo tells of Messer Forese da Rabatta, a learned but ugly jurist, and Giotto, the famous painter, who is also ill-favored.

As they ride, Messer Forese, seeing Giotto's disheveled appearance, jokingly asks if a stranger would believe him to be the world's finest painter. Giotto quickly replies that the stranger would believe it if, seeing Messer Forese, he believed he knew his ABCs, implying Forese's ugliness makes him look unlearned.
6.  **Michele Scalza:** Fiammetta tells of Michele Scalza, a witty young Florentine. In a discussion about the noblest and oldest Florentine families, Scalza claims the ""Cadgers"" (professional beggars) of Santa Maria Maggiore are the best and oldest gentlemen. He wagers a supper on it. He argues that God made the Cadgers when he was ""learning to draw,"" hence their misshapen faces, making them older and nobler than other humans, whom God made after he knew how to draw. The others, amused by his absurd logic, concede the wager.
7.  **Madam Filippa:** Filostrato tells of Madam Filippa of Prato, who is caught in adultery by her husband, Rinaldo de' Pugliesi. According to a cruel local statute, she faces burning. She bravely appears before the provost. When asked if the charge is true, she confesses her love for Lazzerino but argues that laws should be common and made with consent. She asks her husband if she ever denied him her body. He admits she did not. Filippa then asks the provost what she should do with the ""remainder"" of her body, if her husband always took what he needed. She suggests it was better to give it to a gentleman who loved her than to let it go to waste. The people, amused and swayed, demand the statute be modified. It is changed to apply only to women who sell their favors for money. Filippa is acquitted and returns home in triumph.
8.  **Fresco and Ciesca:** Emilia tells of Fresco da Celatico and his niece, Ciesca, a proud and fastidious woman who constantly criticizes others' appearances.

Fresco, annoyed by her airs, tells her that if disagreeable people bother her so much, she should ""never mirror herself in the glass,"" implying she is disagreeable herself. Ciesca, being simple-witted, doesn't understand the rebuke.
9.  **Guido Cavalcanti:** The queen tells of Guido Cavalcanti, a noble Florentine gentleman, renowned for his learning but also for his philosophical speculations (some believed he sought to prove God did not exist). Messer Betto Brunelleschi and his companions, seeing Guido among marble tombs near San Giovanni, try to mock him, asking what he will have accomplished when he finds that God is not. Guido, nimble, places his hand on a tomb, leaps over it, and replies, ""Gentlemen, you may say what you will to me in your own house."" The others are confused, but Messer Betto explains that Guido meant the tombs are the ""houses of the dead,"" implying that compared to learned men like him, they are as good as dead. They are shamed and leave him alone.
10. **Fra Cipolla:** Dioneo tells of Fra Cipolla, a jolly, cunning friar of St. Anthony, who visits Certaldo yearly to collect alms. He promises to show the villagers a feather from the Angel Gabriel. Two young men, Giovanni del Bragioniera and Biagio Pizzini, decide to prank him. While Fra Cipolla dines, they bribe his lazy servant, Guccio, and steal the feather from his saddle-bags, replacing it with coals. After mass, Fra Cipolla, preparing to show the relic, discovers the coals. Without missing a beat, he improvises a grand tale of his travels to exotic lands (Berlinzone, Bengodi, Truffia, Buffia, Menzogna, India Pastinaca) and meeting the Patriarch of Jerusalem, who gave him many relics, including the Angel Gabriel's feather and the coals of St. Lawrence. He claims he mistakenly brought the coals, which are equally holy, especially as St. Lawrence's feast day is approaching. He then uses the coals to make crosses on the villagers, earning more alms. The pranksters, impressed by his quick wit, return the feather.

**Day the Sixth - Conclusion:**

The company laughs heartily at Fra Cipolla's story. Elisa, her reign ending, crowns Dioneo as king. Dioneo, accepting, notes Licisca's earlier comment about women's tricks on their husbands. He sets the theme for the next day: ""OF THE TRICKS WHICH, OR FOR LOVE OR FOR THEIR OWN PRESERVATION, WOMEN HAVE HERETOFORE PLAYED THEIR HUSBANDS, WITH OR WITHOUT THE LATTER'S COGNIZANCE THEREOF."" Some ladies object, but Dioneo defends the theme, citing the freedom of the times and the decorum of their company. He then leads the ladies to the ""Ladies' Valley"" where they bathe. The men later visit the valley. Pamfilo sings a song. The king commands all to rest.

**Day the Seventh**

The next morning, the company travels to the Ladies' Valley, enjoying its beauty. They dine by the lakelet, watching the fish. After dinner, some rest in curtained beds, while others enjoy pastimes. They then gather by the lake for storytelling. Dioneo, as king, commands Emilia to begin.

One night, Gianni unexpectedly returns while Federigo is expected. Tessa hides the capons she prepared for her lover. Federigo knocks. Gianni hears it. Tessa feigns sleep, then claims it's a ""phantom.""

Lydia, aided by her maid, cleverly fulfills all three. She kills the hawk, claiming it stole her husband's time. She pulls a lock of beard during playful caresses. To get a tooth, she convinces Nicostratus he has bad breath and a rotten tooth. She extracts a tooth herself, showing him a decayed one she had prepared. Finally, to prove her love and fulfill her promise to Pyrrhus, she arranges to meet him in the garden under a pear tree.

When the clerk returns the mortar, he is instructed to ask for the cloak back, claiming it was left as a ""token."" Belcolore's husband, present, angrily orders her to return the cloak, not wanting to displease the priest.

3.  **Calandrino and the Heliotrope:** Elisa tells of Calandrino, a simple-minded painter, and his witty friends Bruno and Buffalmacco.

Bruno secretly prepares ginger boluses, but two for Calandrino contain aloes. During the ordeal, Calandrino spits out his bitter boluses, while everyone else swallows theirs.

Salabaetto returns to Palermo with fake merchandise (casks of seawater with a little oil on top, bales of tow). Biancofiore, hearing of his new ""wealth,"" believes she made a mistake and returns his 500 florins, hoping to get more.

While he's there, the innkeeper's wife gets up. Adriano, needing to relieve himself, moves the cradle. The wife, returning in the dark, mistakes Adriano's bed for her husband's and sleeps with Adriano. Pinuccio, returning to his bed, mistakes the innkeeper's bed for Adriano's and tells the innkeeper about his night with Niccolosa. The innkeeper is furious. His wife, realizing her mistake, quickly moves the cradle back to her daughter's bed, then pretends to wake up and scolds her husband for his ""dream"" and Pinuccio for his ""sleepwalking.""

10. **Dom Gianni and the Mare:** Dioneo tells of Dom Gianni, a priest, who travels with Pietro da Tresanti, a simple-minded man.

On the journey, Ruggieri, seeing his mule refuse to urinate in the stable but do so in a river, remarks that the mule is like the King, giving where it shouldn't and not where it should. The servant reports this. The King confronts Ruggieri, who frankly explains his criticism. The King then shows Ruggieri two locked coffers: one with his crown and jewels, the other with earth. He tells Ruggieri to choose one, proving that Ruggieri's misfortune is due to fate, not the King's lack of appreciation. Ruggieri chooses the one with earth. The King, impressed by Ruggieri's worth, gives him the coffer of jewels and allows him to return to Tuscany.
2.  **Ghino di Tacco:** Elisa tells of Ghino di Tacco, a famous highwayman, who captures the Abbot of Cluny, a very rich prelate, near Radicofani. The Abbot is on his way to Siena for a stomach ailment. Ghino, learning of his illness, decides to cure him without baths. He confines the Abbot in a dark, small room, feeding him only two slices of toasted bread and a beaker of wine daily for several days. The Abbot, starving, is cured of his stomach complaint. Ghino then reveals his identity and asks the Abbot to name his ransom. The Abbot, impressed by Ghino's unique ""cure"" and generosity (as Ghino offers to let him take what he will from his possessions), becomes his friend. He takes only a few necessities and returns to Rome. The Abbot then persuades Pope Boniface to pardon Ghino and make him a prior of the Hospitallers, where Ghino lives honorably.
3.  **Mithridanes and Nathan:** Filostrato tells of Nathan, a rich and generous nobleman in Cattajo, renowned for his hospitality. Mithridanes, a young man from a nearby country, envies Nathan's fame and seeks to surpass him. He builds a similar palace and practices even greater hospitality. One day, an old woman, after receiving alms from Mithridanes, remarks that Nathan, despite his many gates, never recognized her, while Mithridanes recognized her after only thirteen. Mithridanes, realizing he cannot match Nathan's generosity, decides to kill him to end his rivalry. He travels to Nathan's palace and, not recognizing Nathan (who is disguised), asks him where Nathan lives. Nathan, still disguised, offers to lead him and, learning Mithridanes's intent, advises him to ambush Nathan in a nearby coppice where he walks alone. The next morning, Nathan goes to the coppice, ready to die. Mithridanes confronts him, but upon hearing Nathan's voice and seeing his face, recognizes him. Overcome with shame and awe at Nathan's magnanimity, he throws down his sword and begs forgiveness. Nathan embraces him, explaining his philosophy of giving freely, even his life, when it is desired. Mithridanes, transformed, becomes Nathan's friend and disciple, learning true generosity.
4.  **Messer Gentile de' Carisendi:** Lauretta tells of Messer Gentile Carisendi, a noble Bolognese gentleman, who loves Madam Catalina, wife of Niccoluccio Caccianimico. Catalina, pregnant, falls gravely ill and is pronounced dead, then buried in a tomb. Gentile, hearing of her death, goes to the tomb to steal a kiss. He finds her not dead, but in a deep coma. He secretly takes her to his mother's house in Bologna. His mother revives her. Catalina gives birth to a son. Gentile, to honor her and her husband, keeps her hidden until he returns from Modona. He then hosts a banquet, inviting Niccoluccio. He poses a question to his guests: if a master abandons a sick servant, and a stranger cures him, who has the right to the servant? Niccoluccio and the others agree the stranger does. Gentile then reveals Catalina and her son, explaining how he rescued her. He returns her and the child to Niccoluccio, emphasizing her chastity while in his care. Niccoluccio, overjoyed, accepts them, and Gentile is praised for his magnanimity.
5.  **Madam Dianora:** Emilia tells of Madam Dianora of Udine, a noble lady, loved by Messer Ansaldo Gradense. To discourage his persistent advances, she demands he present her with a garden as fair in January as in May. Ansaldo, desperate, hires a nigromancer who, for a great sum, creates such a garden. Dianora, seeing the miraculous garden, is dismayed, realizing she must fulfill her promise. She confesses to her husband, Gilberto. Gilberto, though initially angry, is moved by her honesty and Ansaldo's extraordinary effort. He tells her to go to Ansaldo and, if necessary, yield her body but not her soul. Dianora goes to Ansaldo. Ansaldo, witnessing Gilberto's incredible generosity, is so moved that he releases Dianora from her promise, saying he would not dishonor a man who showed such compassion for his love. The nigromancer, in turn, refuses payment, impressed by Gilberto and Ansaldo's magnanimity.
6.  **King Charles the Old:** Fiammetta tells of King Charles the Old (Charles I of Anjou), who, after conquering Manfred, resides in Castellamare. Messer Neri degli Uberti, a Ghibelline exile, lives nearby in a beautiful country estate with two beautiful daughters, Ginevra the Fair and Isotta the Blonde. King Charles, hearing of Neri's garden, invites himself to supper. He is captivated by Neri's daughters, who serve at table. He falls passionately in love with Ginevra. Count Guy de Montfort, his advisor, rebukes him, reminding him of his age, his duty as a king, and the dishonor of taking advantage of a host, especially given Manfred's past abuses of women. The King, shamed, resolves to conquer himself. He returns to Naples and, to honor Messer Neri and overcome his desire, magnificently dowers both daughters and arranges their marriages to noble cavaliers. He then goes to Apulia to mortify his passion.
7.  **Lisa and King Pedro:** Pampinea tells of Lisa, daughter of Bernardo Puccini, a rich apothecary in Palermo. Lisa falls deeply in love with King Pedro of Arragon after seeing him at a festival. Her love is hopeless due to their social disparity, and she falls ill. Desiring to make her love known before she dies, she asks her father to bring Minuccio d'Arezzo, a singer. She confesses her love to Minuccio and asks him to convey it to the King. Minuccio, moved, commissions a song expressing her love and illness. He sings it to the King, who is touched. King Pedro visits Lisa, comforts her, and promises to be her knight. Lisa recovers. The King and Queen then arrange her marriage to a noble but poor young man, Perdicone, endowing him with rich fiefs. King Pedro kisses Lisa on the brow and declares himself her knight for life.
8.  **Sophronia, Gisippus, and Titus:** Filomena tells of Titus Quintius Fulvus, a Roman nobleman, sent to study in Athens. He becomes best friends with his host's son, Gisippus. Gisippus is betrothed to Sophronia, a beautiful Athenian lady. Titus, seeing Sophronia, falls desperately in love and becomes ill. Gisippus, discovering Titus's love, generously offers Sophronia to him, arguing that friendship is more important than marriage. He proposes a plan: Gisippus will marry Sophronia, but Titus will secretly take his place in bed on the wedding night. Titus, after much internal conflict, agrees. They execute the plan, and Titus and Sophronia are married. Titus then returns to Rome, taking Sophronia with him. Sophronia, initially angry at Gisippus's deception, is reconciled. Meanwhile, Gisippus loses his wealth and is exiled from Athens. He comes to Rome, impoverished, and believes Titus has abandoned him. In despair, he confesses to a murder he did not commit, seeking death. Titus, recognizing him, confesses to the same murder to save Gisippus. The true murderer, Publius Ambustus, then confesses, moved by their friendship. Octavianus, impressed, frees all three. Titus shares all his wealth with Gisippus and gives him his sister, Fulvia, in marriage. They live together in Rome in enduring friendship.
9.  **Messer Torello:** The king tells of Messer Torello d'Istria, a magnificent gentleman of Pavia. Saladin, Soldan of Babylon, disguised as a merchant, visits Lombardy to observe Christian preparations for a crusade. Torello, recognizing them as gentlemen, invites Saladin and his companions to his country estate, where he entertains them lavishly. The next day, Torello brings them to Pavia, where his wife, a discreet and great-hearted lady, has prepared an even more magnificent banquet. Torello's generosity and hospitality astound Saladin. They part, with Saladin promising future recompense. Torello later joins the Crusade, promising his wife to wait a year, a month, and a day before remarrying if he doesn't return. He is captured by Saladin's forces and, unknown, becomes Saladin's falconer. Saladin, recognizing a gesture of Torello's, eventually realizes his identity. Saladin, overjoyed, treats Torello with immense honor, making him a lord in his court. Torello, learning his wife is about to remarry, despairs. Saladin, to fulfill his promise, uses a nigromancer to magically transport Torello on a rich bed, with treasures, to Pavia in one night. Torello awakens in his uncle's church. He learns his wife is at her second wedding feast. He goes there, disguised, and drops the ring she gave him into her cup. She recognizes it, realizes he is alive, and joyfully reunites with him. The new bridegroom graciously yields her. Torello returns home, his family and friends rejoicing, and lives happily ever after.
10. **Griselda:** Dioneo tells of Gualtieri, Marquess of Saluzzo, who, despite his reluctance to marry, is persuaded by his vassals to take a wife. He chooses Griselda, a poor peasant girl, for her beauty and virtue, but resolves to test her patience. He marries her and has two children. He then, one by one, pretends to have their children killed, sending them away to be raised in secret. Griselda endures these trials with unwavering patience and obedience, never complaining. After twelve years, he announces he is divorcing her to marry a nobler woman. He sends her back to her father's house in her shift, taking everything she brought. Griselda, still patient, returns to her humble life. Gualtieri then sends for her, asking her to prepare his palace for his ""new bride."" Griselda, in her coarse clothes, diligently prepares everything. The ""new bride"" arrives, who is actually their daughter, now twelve years old, accompanied by her six-year-old brother. Griselda welcomes her. Gualtieri then reveals the truth, embracing Griselda and their children. Everyone is astonished. Griselda is restored to her position as Marchioness, honored by all for her incredible patience and virtue.

**Conclusion of the Author**

The author concludes his work, thanking God and the ladies for their solace. He addresses potential criticisms:
*   **Overmuch license/unseemly stories:** He argues that the nature of the stories required such content, and that he expressed them in seemly terms. He compares his freedom to that of a painter depicting Adam and Eve naked or the crucifixion with one or two nails. He emphasizes that the stories were told in a garden, for diversion, among mature individuals, not in church or schools. He states that stories, like wine or fire, can be used for good or ill depending on the listener's disposition.
*   **Some stories better away:** He states he only wrote what was told, so the fault lies with the tellers. He also notes that no craftsman (except God) makes everything perfectly, and that even a field has weeds. He was speaking to ""simple lasses"" and chose appropriate material.
*   **Overlong stories:** He reminds readers that the work is for ""idle women"" to pass time, and nothing is too long if it serves its purpose. Students, who use time productively, might prefer brevity, but ladies, who have much leisure, need longer diversions.
*   **Quips and cranks/lack of gravity:** He thanks those concerned for his reputation but states he is ""light"" and that friars' sermons are full of such jests, so they are appropriate for stories meant to ease melancholy.
*   **Ill tongue/criticism of friars:** He acknowledges that some might find his portrayal of friars venomous but suggests it's because they are ""good folk"" who ""grind with a full head of water and tell no tales."" He maintains that his tongue is ""the best and sweetest in the world"" (as a neighbor told him). He leaves readers to their own opinions and bids them farewell, hoping the stories have been useful."
The Divine Comedy-Dante Alighieri,"The provided text, ""The Divine Comedy: Hell or The Inferno,"" details the narrator's journey through Hell, guided by the poet Virgil.

**Canto I:**
The narrator, in the midway of his mortal life, finds himself lost in a dark, savage wood, having strayed from the direct path. He reaches the foot of a mountain, which offers a brief respite from his fear. As he attempts to ascend, a nimble, speckled panther blocks his way, making him consider turning back. Despite the morning sun and the sweet season, his joy is short-lived as a hunger-mad lion and a lean she-wolf appear, driving him back down to a lower, sunless space. There, he encounters a faint-voiced figure. The narrator cries for mercy, and the figure identifies himself as Virgil, a bard born in Mantua, who lived in Rome under Augustus and sang of Aeneas. The narrator, recognizing Virgil as his master and guide, begs for salvation from the she-wolf. Virgil explains that the beast is insatiable and will not permit passage, prophesying the coming of a ""greyhound"" who will destroy her and bring safety to Italia. Virgil offers to guide the narrator through an ""eternal space"" where he will see tormented spirits and then those hoping for bliss. However, Virgil, being judged a rebel by the ""Almighty King,"" cannot lead him to the regions of the blessed; a worthier spirit must take over. The narrator accepts, asking to be led to ""Saint Peter's gate."" They then move onward.

**Canto II:**
As day departs, the narrator prepares for the perilous journey, invoking the Muses for aid. He expresses doubt to Virgil about his worthiness, noting that figures like Aeneas and Paul undertook such journeys for divine purposes related to Rome and the Church, while he is neither. Virgil perceives his fear and reveals the reason for his presence: he was summoned by a blessed and lovely lady named Beatrice. Beatrice, seeing the narrator lost and fearful, commanded Virgil to assist him, promising to praise Virgil to her Master. She explained that another blessed lady in heaven (Lucia) also mourned the narrator's plight and urged her to act. Beatrice assured Virgil that she felt no dread in entering Hell, being divinely framed against its miseries. Virgil's account restores the narrator's courage, and he reaffirms Virgil as his guide, master, and lord, resuming his journey into the deep, woody way.

**Canto III:**
They arrive at a lofty portal inscribed with words declaring it the entrance to the ""city of woe,"" ""eternal pain,"" and the place of ""people lost for aye,"" where all hope must be abandoned. Virgil explains that these are souls doomed to misery, who have lost ""intellectual good."" Inside, they hear a chaotic tumult of sighs, lamentations, and angry cries. Virgil explains these are the souls of those who lived without praise or blame, mixed with angels who were neither rebellious nor faithful to God. Heaven cast them out to preserve its beauty, and Hell refuses them to prevent the wicked from glorying. They have no hope of death and envy all other lots. The narrator sees a rapidly whirling flag followed by a vast train of naked spirits, stung by wasps and hornets, their blood and tears falling to be gathered by worms. He recognizes one who ""abjur'd his high estate"" due to fear. Further on, they reach the river Acheron, where an old boatman, Charon, appears. Charon warns the wicked spirits that he comes to take them to eternal darkness, heat, and ice, and tells the living narrator to depart. Virgil silences Charon, stating their passage is divinely willed. The spirits, upon hearing their cruel fate, blaspheme God and their origins, then are collected by Charon and ferried across the dark river, like falling autumn leaves. Virgil explains that God's justice goads them, turning their fear into desire to cross. Suddenly, the gloomy region shakes, a vermilion flame shoots forth, and the narrator faints.

**Canto IV:**
A loud thunderclap awakens the narrator. He finds himself on the brink of a dark, deep abyss filled with innumerable plaints, its bottom obscured by clouds. Virgil, pale with pity (not fear), leads him down into the first circle, Limbo. Here, only sighs are heard, not from torture, but from the grief of vast multitudes of men, women, and infants. Virgil explains that these spirits are blameless of sin but lacked baptism, the ""portal to thy faith,"" or lived before the Gospel without serving God correctly. They are lost, afflicted only by ""desiring without hope."" The narrator, saddened, asks if any have ever left this place for bliss. Virgil recounts that he was new to Limbo when a ""puissant one"" (Christ) arrived, crowned with victory, and drew forth the shades of Adam, Abel, Noah, Moses, Abraham, David, Israel, Rachel, and many others to salvation.
They continue through the spirits, seeing a flame that illuminates a tribe of high honor. Virgil explains that their renown in the upper world earned them favor. A voice calls to honor Virgil. Four mighty spirits approach: Homer, Horace, Ovid, and Lucan. They greet Virgil, and then honor the narrator by making him the sixth in their learned band. They proceed to a magnificent castle with seven walls and a pleasant stream, entering through seven gates into a verdant mead. Here, they see noble figures like Electra, Hector, Aeneas, Caesar, Camilla, King Latinus, Brutus, Lucretia, Marcia, Julia, Cornelia, and the Soldan. The narrator then sees Aristotle, the ""master of the sapient throng,"" surrounded by other philosophers like Socrates, Plato, Democritus, and many more. Virgil then leads the narrator away from this serene place into a storm-vexed climate where no light shines.

**Canto V:**
They descend to the second circle, a smaller space containing greater grief. Minos, a ghastly monster, judges souls, examining their crimes and coiling his tail around himself to indicate the degree of descent into Hell. The narrator approaches, and Minos warns him to beware whom he trusts. Virgil silences Minos, asserting their divinely appointed path. The narrator then hears rueful wailings and enters a place where ""light was silent all."" A tempestuous wind, like a stormy sea, drives the spirits, whirling and dashing them, causing shrieks, lamentations, and blasphemies. These are the ""carnal sinners,"" whose reason was swayed by lust. Virgil identifies Semiramis, Dido (who slew herself), Cleopatra, Helen, Achilles, Paris, and Tristan among them, all victims of love. Overwhelmed by pity, the narrator asks to speak to two spirits who move together. Virgil advises him to entreat them by the love that carries them. The spirits, like doves, approach. One (Francesca) thanks the narrator for his pity and, while the wind is mute, tells her story. She explains that Love, quickly learned in a gentle heart, entangled her beloved by her beauty, which was cruelly taken from her. Love, which denies no one beloved, caught her with pleasing him, and he still does not desert her. Love led them to ""one death,"" and ""Caina waits the soul, who spilt our life."" The narrator, deeply moved, asks how they came to know their uncertain wishes. Francesca recounts that one day, reading of Lancelot's love, their eyes met, their cheeks paled, and when they read of the rapturous kiss, her companion (Paolo) kissed her. The book and writer were ""love's purveyors,"" and they read no more that day. As she speaks, the other spirit wails, and the narrator, heartstruck, faints like a corpse.

**Canto VI:**
Reviving from his faint, the narrator finds himself in the third circle, where ceaseless, accursed, heavy, cold showers of hail, discolored water, and sleet fall, making the land stink. Cerberus, a fierce, three-throated monster, barks over the spirits, tearing and dismembering them with his claws. Virgil silences Cerberus by throwing earth into his maw. They pass over the prostrate shades. One spirit, Ciacco, sits up and asks if the narrator recognizes him. The narrator, unable to recognize him due to his anguish-altered form, asks his identity. Ciacco, from Florence, identifies himself as being here for gluttony. The narrator asks about the fate of Florence, its just citizens, and the cause of its discord. Ciacco prophesies civil strife, bloodshed, and the eventual triumph of one party over another, noting that only two just men remain, neglected, and that avarice, envy, and pride are the city's ruin. The narrator asks about other worthy Florentines, but Ciacco says they are ""blacker spirits"" sunk deeper. Ciacco asks the narrator to remember him in the upper world, then falls back among his companions. Virgil explains that all these spirits will resume their bodies at the Last Judgment. The narrator asks if their tortures will increase, mitigate, or remain the same. Virgil replies that as things approach perfection, they feel more acutely, so their pains will be greater then. They journey on to the fourth steep ledge, where they find Plutus.

**Canto VII:**
Plutus cries out, ""Ah me! O Satan! Satan!"" Virgil reassures the narrator and silences Plutus, stating their journey is divinely willed. Plutus collapses. They descend to the fourth circle, where the narrator sees countless spirits, more numerous than elsewhere, engaged in a ""wretched dance."" They roll heavy weights with their chests, clashing together and shouting, ""Why holdest thou so fast?"" and ""And why castest thou away?"" Virgil explains these are the souls of misers and prodigals, who made no proper use of their wealth. He notes that many Popes and Cardinals are among the avaricious. The narrator asks if he will recognize any, but Virgil says their ignoble lives make them indiscernible. He laments human folly for valuing worldly goods so highly. The narrator then asks about ""Fortune,"" whose talons grasp the world's blessings. Virgil explains that God ordained Fortune as a general minister to rule over worldly goods, changing them from race to race, beyond human wisdom's control. She is blessed and unheeding of human curses. They then descend to a well that boils and pours into a dark, inky foss, which expands into the Stygian lake. Here, the narrator sees a ""miry tribe"" of naked, enraged spirits, striking each other with hands, heads, breasts, and feet, tearing with their fangs. Virgil identifies them as those overcome by anger, and also reveals a multitude beneath the water, fixed in the slime, whose sighs make bubbles on the surface. These submerged spirits lament their past sadness in the sweet air and their present woe in the murky settlings. They proceed along the edge of the pool to the base of a tower.

**Canto VIII:**
At the tower, they see two signal fires answered by a third in the distance. Virgil explains that they will soon see what awaits them on the filthy waters. A small bark, ferried by Phlegyas, quickly approaches. Phlegyas challenges the narrator, but Virgil silences him, stating they only need passage across the slimy pool. Virgil and the narrator board the skiff, which sinks deeper than usual with their weight. As they cross, a spirit drenched in mire asks the narrator why he comes before his time. The narrator replies he does not tarry and asks the spirit's identity. The spirit says he mourns. The narrator recognizes him as Filippo Argenti and tells him to remain in woe. Filippo reaches for the bark, but Virgil pushes him back, calling him to the ""other dogs."" Virgil then embraces the narrator, praising his disdain, and reveals that Filippo was known for arrogance. The narrator wishes to see Filippo whelmed in the dregs. Virgil assures him this will happen, and immediately, other spirits set upon Filippo, tearing him.
They then approach the ""city of Dis,"" whose minarets glow vermilion from eternal fire. They enter the deep fosses moating the city, whose walls appear made of iron. At the gates, they encounter more than a thousand fallen angels, who challenge the narrator's passage as a living man. Virgil attempts to parley, but the demons demand the narrator return alone by his ""witless way,"" while Virgil must tarry as his escort. The narrator is terrified. Virgil reassures him that their passage is divinely permitted and tells him to wait, promising not to leave him. Virgil departs to parley, but the demons close the gates on him. Virgil returns, angered and disheartened, but tells the narrator not to fear, as he will vanquish them. He reveals that their insolence is not new and that someone of ""strong might"" is coming to open the land for them.

**Canto IX:**
The narrator's fear is now reflected in Virgil's face. Virgil, listening intently into the dark air, affirms they will win this fight, though he wishes the promised help would arrive sooner. The narrator, noting Virgil's fragmented speech, asks if any from Limbo ever descend to this depth. Virgil replies rarely, but he once did, conjured by the sorceress Erictho to retrieve a spirit from ""Judas' circle,"" the lowest part of Hell. He reassures the narrator he knows the way. The narrator's attention is drawn to the burning top of the tower, where three blood-stained hellish furies, with hydras and serpents for hair, suddenly appear. Virgil identifies them as Megaera, Alecto, and Tisiphone. They tear their breasts and raise a clamor, calling for Medusa to turn the narrator to stone. Virgil quickly turns the narrator around and covers his eyes with his own hands, warning that seeing the Gorgon would prevent his return. A loud-crashing sound, like an impetuous wind, makes the shores tremble. Virgil uncovers the narrator's eyes, telling him to look at the ancient foam. He sees more than a thousand spirits fleeing before a heavenly messenger who walks across the Stygian sound with unwet feet. The messenger, appearing full of noble anger, touches the gate with his wand, and it flies open. He rebukes the fallen angels for their insolence and resistance to God's will, reminding them of Cerberus's past punishment. He then turns back without speaking. The narrator and Virgil enter unopposed, finding a wide space filled with pain and torment. They see countless sepulchres with open lids, flames scattered among them, burning intensely. Lamentable moans issue from within. Virgil explains these vaults contain ""arch-heretics"" and their followers, buried ""like with like,"" with varying degrees of heat. They turn right and proceed between the afflicted and the ramparts.

**Canto X:**
They walk along a secret pathway between the walls and the burning tombs. The narrator asks if the spirits within can be seen, as the lids are open. Virgil replies they will be closed when the spirits return from Josaphat with their bodies, and explains this section holds Epicurus and his followers, who believe the soul dies with the body. A voice from a vault, recognizing the narrator's Tuscan speech, asks him to stay, saying he ""dealt too severely"" with his native land. Virgil identifies the speaker as Farinata, who has risen from his tomb, appearing to hold hell in scorn. Virgil urges the narrator to speak clearly. Farinata asks the narrator's ancestry. The narrator reveals it. Farinata, noting their fierce opposition to his family, boasts of scattering them twice. The narrator retorts that his family always returned, an art Farinata's kin have not learned.
Then, another shade, Cavalcante de' Cavalcanti, rises beside Farinata, looking for someone with the narrator. Seeing no one else, he tearfully asks why his son, Guido, is not with the narrator, if he is led by ""lofty genius."" The narrator replies he is guided by Virgil, ""whom perchance Guido thy son Had in contempt."" Cavalcante, hearing ""HAD,"" cries out, believing his son is dead and no longer sees the blessed daylight. Due to the narrator's slight hesitation, Cavalcante falls back into his tomb. Farinata, unmoved, continues their previous discourse, stating that his party's lack of skill in returning from exile torments him more than his fiery bed. He prophesies that within fifty lunar cycles, the narrator will know the full weight of that art (exile). He then asks why the Florentines are so hostile to his kin. The narrator attributes it to the slaughter at Arbia. Farinata sighs, then states he stood alone against the general consent to raze Florence. The narrator asks him to clarify if the spirits here see the future but not the present. Farinata explains they see ""objects far remote"" but their intellect fails for things that approach or actually exist, and their knowledge will expire when ""futurity the portals close."" The narrator, remorseful for his delay, asks Farinata to tell Cavalcante that his son is still alive. Virgil summons the narrator. Farinata names Frederick II and the Lord Cardinal as companions in his tomb, then withdraws. The narrator ponders the ill tidings for his future. Virgil advises him to store what he heard, as Beatrice will unfold his life's future. They turn left and descend to a valley exhaling noisome steam.

**Canto XI:**
They pause at the edge of a high bank, behind a tomb inscribed with ""Pope Anastasius, whom Photinus drew From the right path,"" to accustom themselves to the fetid exhalation rising from the abyss below. Virgil explains the structure of the lower Hell: three inner circles, each containing accursed spirits. He details the nature of sin: injury by force or fraud. Fraud, being peculiar to man, is more displeasing to God.
*   **First Circle (of the Violent):** Divided into three rounds.
    *   Violence against neighbors (slayers, plunderers, robbers).
    *   Violence against oneself and possessions (suicides, destroyers of goods).
    *   Violence against God (blasphemers, contemners of nature's law, usurers, Sodomites, Cahors).
*   **Second Circle (of the Fraudulent):** Divided into two parts.
    *   Fraud against those who trust (dissimulation, witchcraft, flatteries, theft, falsehood, simony, seduction to lust, those who pawn honesty).
    *   Fraud against those who withhold strict confidence, forgetting both general love and special faith (traitors, in the ""lesser circle, Point of the universe, dread seat of Dis"").
The narrator asks why the incontinent (lustful, gluttonous, avaricious, wrathful) are punished outside the city of Dis. Virgil reminds him that incontinence offends God least, and divine justice pours less vengeance on them. The narrator then asks for clarification on usury. Virgil explains that philosophy shows nature imitates the divine, and human art follows nature. Both are sources of life and excellence. Usurers, however, walk another path, setting nature and art at naught, placing their hope elsewhere. Virgil notes the time by the stars and urges them onward to their steep descent.

**Canto XII:**
They reach a precipitous descent, rough as an Alp, guarded by the Minotaur, which gnaws itself in rage. Virgil rebukes the monster, stating they are not Theseus but come to witness torments. The Minotaur plunges in fury, allowing them to descend through the ruined crags. Virgil explains that this rock fell during Christ's descent into Hell, which caused an earthquake. He directs the narrator's attention to the approaching ""river of blood,"" in which those who injured by violence are steeped. The narrator laments lust and wrath. He sees a wide, bow-shaped foss filled with boiling blood, patrolled by Centaurs armed with arrows. Three Centaurs challenge them. Virgil replies they will speak to Chiron, their leader. Virgil identifies Nessus, Chiron, and Pholus. Chiron notices the narrator is alive. Virgil explains their divine mission and asks Nessus to guide them across the bloody river, carrying the narrator on his back. Nessus agrees.
As they proceed along the bank, Nessus points out spirits immersed in the blood: tyrants given to blood and rapine, including Alexander, Dionysius, Azzolino, and Obizzo of Este. He also points to one who ""in God's bosom smote the heart"" (Guy de Montfort). The blood becomes shallower, eventually only covering the feet. Nessus explains that the river's depth varies, and further on, Attila, Sextus, Pyrrhus, and the Rinieri are punished. Nessus then turns back.

**Canto XIII:**
They enter a trackless, dark, gnarled, and thorny forest, where the Harpies make their nests, wailing. Virgil explains this is the second round of the seventh circle. The narrator hears sad plainings but sees no one. Virgil instructs him to break a twig to understand. The narrator plucks a branch, and dark blood trickles from the trunk, which cries out, ""Why pluck'st thou me? ... Men once were we, that now are rooted here."" The narrator, terrified, drops the bough. Virgil apologizes for the narrator's disbelief and asks the spirit to identify himself so his fame can be revived in the upper world. The spirit, Pier della Vigna, replies that he was a trusted counselor to Frederick II, holding ""both keys to Frederick's heart."" Envy, ""the harlot,"" inflamed minds against him, leading to his downfall. In disdain and disgust, he sought refuge in death, becoming ""unjust toward myself."" He swears he was faithful to his lord and asks for his memory to be cleared.
The narrator, moved by pity, asks Virgil to question the spirit further. Virgil asks how souls are tied in these trees and if they can ever be freed. The spirit explains that when a soul tears itself from its body (suicide), it is doomed to the seventh gulf by Minos, falls into this wood wherever chance hurls it, sprouts into a sapling, and grows into a savage plant. The Harpies feed on its leaves, causing pain and grief. They will retrieve their bodies at the Last Judgment but will not be clothed in them, as it is unjust to have what one takes from oneself; their bodies will be hung on their thorns.
Suddenly, two naked spirits, torn by briers, flee through the wood, pursued by black female mastiffs. The first cries for death; the second, Lano, is overtaken and, lacking breath, makes one group of himself and a bush. The mastiffs tear him piecemeal. The bush, Giacomo da Sant' Andrea, laments being used as a screen and the blame his ill life brings upon it. He reveals he was from Florence, which changed its patron from Mars to the Baptist, and that he ""slung the fatal noose from my own roof"" (committed suicide).

**Canto XIV:**
The narrator gathers the scattered leaves and restores them to the suicide tree. They reach the boundary between the second and third rounds, a wide plain of arid, thick sand, surrounded by the mournful wood and sad foss. Slow-falling flakes of fire rain down on naked spirits, who lie supine, crouch, or pace incessantly, weeping. The narrator asks about a huge spirit who lies scornfully, heedless of the burning. The spirit, Capaneus, identifies himself as he was in life, defying Jove and his lightning even in death. Virgil rebukes his pride, stating that his unquenched rage is his punishment. Virgil explains Capaneus was one of the seven kings who besieged Thebes, holding God in disdain. Virgil warns the narrator not to step on the hot sand but to keep close to the wood.
They reach a crimson-waved brook that gushes from the forest, its bottom and banks stone-built, providing a safe passage from the flames. Virgil praises this river as the most remarkable sight so far. The narrator asks for an explanation. Virgil describes Crete, a desolate island with Mount Ida, where Rhea hid Saturn's son. Within Ida stands a huge, ancient form (the Old Man of Crete), whose head is gold, breast and arms silver, middle brass, and lower parts steel, except for a clay right foot. Tears distill from fissures in this statue, forming Acheron, Styx, and Phlegethon, and eventually Cocytus at the lowest depth. The narrator asks why this stream appears only now. Virgil explains the circular nature of Hell, and that they have not yet completed the circuit. The narrator asks about Lethe. Virgil says he will see Lethe elsewhere, where spirits wash away penitentially removed blame. They then leave the wood, following the stone margins.

**Canto XV:**
They walk along a stone margin, enveloped in a mist from the stream that protects them from the fire. They encounter a troop of spirits who eye them intently. One spirit, Brunetto Latini, recognizes the narrator and asks to walk with him. The narrator, respecting his former teacher, agrees, but cannot sit due to the rule that stopping for an instant means a hundred years without relief from the fire. Brunetto asks what chance brings the narrator here. The narrator explains he was lost in a valley and Virgil is now leading him home. Brunetto prophesies a glorious future for the narrator if he follows his star, but warns him of enmity from the ""ungrateful and malignant race"" of Florence, who are covetous, envious, and proud. He advises the narrator to cleanse himself of their ways, as he will be sought by both parties. The narrator expresses his deep respect and affection for Brunetto, recalling his teachings on winning eternity, and says he records Brunetto's prophecy for Beatrice to interpret. Virgil notes that the narrator listens well. The narrator asks about other known spirits in Brunetto's tribe. Brunetto names Priscian and Francesco d'Accorso, and mentions one (Andrea de' Mozzi) transferred by the Pope. He then sees another company approaching, with whom he cannot sort, and commends his ""TREASURE"" (his literary work) to the narrator before speeding away like a runner winning a prize.

**Canto XVI:**
They arrive at a place where the loud din of falling water signals the next round. Three spirits, running swiftly through the fiery storm, call to the narrator, recognizing him by his garb as an ""inmate of our evil land."" The narrator notes their fire-inflicted wounds. Virgil pauses, saying they deserve courtesy. The three spirits, whirling in a restless wheel, ask the narrator his identity, hoping their renown will incline him to speak. They identify themselves as Guidoguerra, Aldobrandi, and Rusticucci, all Florentines, brought to this punishment (for sodomy) by their sins, Rusticucci blaming his savage wife. The narrator expresses grief, not scorn, for their doom, and identifies himself as a countryman, on a journey to the center of Hell. Guidoguerra asks if courtesy and valor still dwell in Florence, as Borsiere, a recently condemned peer, brings sad news. The narrator laments Florence's pride and excess, which have engendered its current woes. The three spirits are pleased by his words and ask him to speak of them in the upper world if he returns. They then flee swiftly.
The narrator and Virgil continue, the sound of the water growing deafening. They reach a craggy precipice where the dark wave roars downward. The narrator, at Virgil's command, unloosens a cord from his girdle (which he once used to try to catch a ""painted leopard""). Virgil casts it into the abyss. The narrator wonders at this strange signal. Virgil explains that what he expects, and what the narrator is dreaming of, will soon appear. The narrator then sees a monstrous shape swimming up through the murky air, like one returning from loosening an anchor.

**Canto XVII:**
Virgil identifies the creature as Geryon, the ""fell monster with the deadly sting,"" the vile image of fraud. Geryon's head and upper body are on land, but his bestial tail remains in the void, armed with a scorpion's sting. His face is like a just man's, kind and gracious, but the rest is serpent, with shaggy claws and a back, breast, and sides painted with variegated nodes and orbits. Virgil tells the narrator they must approach Geryon. They descend to the right, walking ten paces on the verge to avoid the flames. The narrator sees a tribe of spirits seated on the sand near the chasm. Virgil sends the narrator to observe them briefly, while he parleys with Geryon for passage.
The narrator observes the spirits, whose pangs gush from their eyes, shifting their hands against the vapors and torrid soil like dogs against gnats. He notices each bears a pouch with emblems around his neck, on which their eyes seem to feed. He sees a yellow purse with a lion, a red one with a goose, and another with a fat, azure swine. The spirit with the swine addresses him, asking what he does there and telling him that his neighbor Vitaliano will sit on his left, and he is a Paduan among Florentines. He mentions that they often hear thunderous cries for a ""noble knight"" who will bring a pouch with three beaks. The spirit then writhes his mouth and lolls his tongue. The narrator, mindful of Virgil's instruction not to linger, returns.
He finds Virgil already seated on Geryon's haunch. Virgil encourages him to be bold for the steep descent and tells him to mount first, with Virgil in the middle to protect him from the tail. The narrator, though terrified, is shamed into compliance. Virgil embraces him and commands Geryon to move with ample gyres and an easy descent, mindful of his unusual burden. Geryon loosens from the bank and steers like an eel, gathering air with retractile claws. The narrator's dread is immense, comparable to Phaeton or Icarus. He sees only the beast and feels the wind from below. He hears a hideous crash of a cataract beneath them, and new terror strikes him as he sees flames and hears wailings, realizing their downward course is winding towards the torments. Geryon descends like a weary falcon, landing them at the base of the deep-furrowed rock, then springs away like an arrow.

**Canto XVIII:**
They arrive at Malebolge, a rock-stained region with ten concentric trenches (bolge) separated by rocky bridges. Virgil leads the way to the left. In the first chasm, the narrator sees naked sinners, scourged by horned demons with huge lashes, making them bound at the first stripe. The narrator recognizes Venedico Caccianemico, who confesses he led Ghisola to do the Marquis's will and that Bologna is full of such ""barterers"" of women. A demon strikes him. They move to the next pier. Virgil identifies a lofty shade as Jason, who beguiled Hypsipyle on Lemnos, leaving her forlorn, and Medea's injuries are avenged here.
In the second chasm, they hear ghosts jibbering and snorting, immersed in ordure, covered in a foul scurf. The narrator recognizes Alessio Interminei of Lucca, who admits his flatteries sunk him here. Virgil points out Thais, a harlot who flattered her paramour.

**Canto XIX:**
The narrator denounces Simon Magus and his followers, who prostitute God's things for gold. They are in the third chasm. He sees the livid stone full of circular apertures, like baptismal fonts, from which sinners' feet and legs emerge, burning at the soles, causing violent quivering. The narrator asks about one spirit burning with a ruddier flame. Virgil offers to carry him down. The narrator agrees.
Virgil descends with the narrator to the orifice of the quivering limb. The spirit, mistaking the narrator for Pope Boniface VIII, cries out, lamenting that Boniface has arrived earlier than prophesied to ""surfeit with the wealth"" for which he ""fearedst not in guile to take The lovely lady, and then mangle her."" Virgil quickly corrects the spirit's error. The spirit, Pope Nicholas III, reveals he was robed in the papal mantle and was a ""son of a she-bear"" (Orsini family), eager to advance his nephews. He explains that his predecessors in simony are dragged beneath his head, and he will fall lower when Boniface arrives. He then prophesies the coming of an even ""uglier"" shepherd (Clement V) from the west, who will cover both his and Boniface's forms. The narrator, incensed, denounces the simoniacal Popes, reminding them that Christ asked no gold from St. Peter for the keys, and that their avarice has cast the world in mourning. He laments Constantine's ""plenteous dower"" to Pope Sylvester I, which gave birth to much ill. The spirit spins in anger or conscience. Virgil, pleased, lifts the narrator to his bosom and carries him to the next pier, where another vale appears.

**Canto XX:**
The narrator looks into the fourth chasm, weeping at the sight of spirits whose heads are twisted backward on their necks, forcing them to walk backward. Virgil rebukes his pity, stating that here, pity is dead. He points out Amphiaraus, Tiresias (who changed sex), Aruns, and Manto. Virgil then recounts the founding of Mantua, his native city, by Manto, who settled in a fen near Lake Benacus to avoid human converse, and on whose dead bones the city was built. He warns the narrator against any other origin story. The narrator asks about other notable spirits. Virgil points out Eurypilus, Michael Scot (a magician), Guido Bonatti, and Asdente (who repents not having stuck to his craft). He then shows the ""wretches"" who left their crafts to become diviners and witches. Virgil notes the time by the stars and urges them onward.

**Canto XXI:**
They reach the fifth chasm, where a glutinous, thick mass boils like pitch in a Venetian arsenal, liming the shore. The narrator sees a black devil running up the rock, carrying a sinner on his shoulder. The devil cries to other ""keen-taloned fiends"" on a bridge to cast the sinner (an elder from Santa Zita, a barterer) into the pitch, as that land has many such. The sinner sinks and rises, but the demons grapple him with hooks, telling him to sport covered in the pitch. Virgil instructs the narrator to hide behind a rock while he confronts the demons. Virgil passes to the sixth pier, where the demons rush at him with weapons. Virgil demands to speak to their leader, Malacoda, to determine if they have permission to seize him. Malacoda advances, and Virgil explains their divinely willed journey. Malacoda's pride falls, and he drops his weapon, telling the others they have no power to strike Virgil. Virgil calls the narrator to return safely. The narrator, fearing the fiends, quickly joins Virgil. Malacoda tells them that the rock bridge is broken at the sixth arch and suggests they take an alternate path up a cavern, where another rock provides safe passage. He states that the bridge broke 1266 years ago, five hours later than the current time. He dispatches ten of his fiends—Alichino, Calcabrina, Cagnazzo, Barbariccia (their leader), Libicocco, Draghinazzo, Ciriatto, Graffiacane, Farfarello, and Rubicant—to escort them, assuring them they will be ""nothing fell."" The narrator expresses fear, but Virgil tells him not to worry, as their gnarls are only spite against the tormented souls. The fiends turn left, and their leader gives an ""obscene triumphant"" signal.

**Canto XXII:**
The narrator describes the strange sight of the ten demons escorting them. He observes the pitch, where sinners briefly show their backs to ease pain, like dolphins. Like frogs at a moat, sinners stand at the brink but hide when Barbariccia approaches. One sinner remains, and Graffiacan seizes him and drags him up, appearing like an otter. The demons threaten to flay him. The narrator asks Virgil to identify the sinner. The sinner, from Navarre, confesses to peculating while serving King Thibault. Ciriatto rips him with a tusk. Barbariccia intervenes, allowing Virgil to question the sinner further. The sinner reveals he just parted from Friar Gomita of Gallura, a vessel of guile who took money to free his master's enemies, and Michel Zanche, chief of Logodoro, also a barterer. Libicocco then tears off a sinewy part of the sinner's arm. The sinner, quaking, offers to cause Tuscan or Lombard spirits to appear if the fiends abate their fury, promising to make seven appear with his whistle. Cagnazzo mocks this as a trick. Alichino, disagreeing with the others, says if the sinner casts himself down, he will pursue him by air. The fiends turn their eyes to the other shore. The Navarrese sinner seizes his chance, leaps onto land, and escapes into the pitch. Alichino, enraged, pursues him but fails. Calcabrina, in fury, turns on Alichino, and they grapple and fall into the boiling lake, their wings glued by the pitch. Barbariccia dispatches four more fiends to help them. The narrator and Virgil depart, leaving them to the broil.

**Canto XXIII:**
They proceed in silence, the narrator musing on Aesop's fable of the mouse and frog, and fearing the demons' renewed pursuit. He tells Virgil he feels their talons already. Virgil, reading his thoughts, reassures him they can escape by descending into the next chasm if the right coast inclines. Before Virgil finishes, the demons appear with spread wings. Virgil quickly snatches the narrator like a mother saving her child from fire, casting himself down from the jutting beach to a pendent rock that closes the next chasm. Virgil runs along the edge, carrying the narrator. The fiends reach the steep above them but cannot follow, as divine Providence prevents them from leaving their assigned foss.
In the depth, they see a ""painted tribe"" pacing slowly, weeping, faint and toiled. They wear caps with hoods, overlaid with dazzling gold on the outside, but all lead within, of immense weight. They turn left with these spirits. The narrator asks Virgil to find a spirit whose name is known. One spirit, understanding Tuscan, calls to them. Virgil tells the narrator to pause. Two spirits, Catalano and Loderingo, ""joyous friars"" from Bologna, approach. They identify themselves as hypocrites, whose leaden cloaks, gilded outside, are their eternal punishment. They were once arbiters in Florence, but their actions brought strife. The narrator then sees a spirit fixed to a cross with three stakes, distorted. Catalano explains this is Caiaphas, who counseled the Pharisees that one man should suffer for the people. He lies transverse, and all must pass over him, feeling his weight. Virgil asks if there is an opening on their right to exit without encountering the dark angels. Catalano replies that a rock from the next circle, though shattered here, oversteps each vale, and they can mount by its ruin. Virgil, realizing Malacoda lied about the broken bridge, is angered. The narrator follows Virgil, who proceeds with large strides.

**Canto XXIV:**
The narrator describes the changing hope of a peasant in winter, mirroring his own disheartenment and swift recovery upon seeing Virgil's sweet look. They reach the fallen bridge. Virgil, after contemplating the ruin, lifts the narrator up the craggy steps. The ascent is rugged, narrow, and steep. The narrator talks to appear less faint. A voice from the next foss, full of anger, issues forth, but the narrator cannot discern the words due to darkness. Virgil says they will proceed by deed, not words. They descend to the eighth chasm, where the narrator sees a terrible crowd of hideous serpents, more numerous and dire than any in Lybia or Ethiopia. Naked spirits, bound by serpents, run in fear. An adder transpierces one spirit (Vanni Fucci) in the neck. He instantly kindles, burns to ashes, and then spontaneously reforms, like a Phoenix. The narrator laments God's severe judgment. Vanni Fucci identifies himself as a ""mule"" from Pistoia, pleased by a ""bestial life,"" and confesses to rifling a sacristy and falsely charging another. To prevent the narrator from rejoicing, he forebodes future woes for Florence and Pistoia, involving the Neri and Biancos, and a vapor from Valdimagra that will strike the Biancos to the ground.

**Canto XXV:**
Vanni Fucci raises his hands in mockery and blasphemes God. Serpents immediately bind his neck and arms, silencing him. The narrator laments Pistoia's evil. Vanni Fucci flees, pursued by a furious Centaur, Cacus, who has a dragon breathing fire on his shoulders. Virgil identifies Cacus as a thief punished for stealing a herd. Three more spirits appear. As one names Cianfa, a six-footed serpent springs onto him, fastening and intertwining with him. The two melt into each other, mingling hues, becoming a single, monstrous form, neither two nor one. Then, another fiery adder transpierces one of the remaining two spirits (Buoso) where life is nourished. The pierced spirit falls, and both serpent and spirit breathe thick smoke, their vapors joining. They undergo a mutual transformation: the serpent's tail splits, and the spirit's legs compact; the tail takes the spirit's lost form, its skin softening while the spirit's hardens; the monster's feet lengthen as the spirit's shrink; the spirit's feet twist into a hidden part. Both are veiled in new colors. One rises upright, the other falls prone. Their faces also transform: the standing one's face retreats, ears shoot out, nose shapes, and lips swell; the prone one's face sharpens, ears draw into the head, and his tongue severs while the other's unites. The transformed soul (now a serpent) hisses away, and the other (now human) speaks, telling another spirit, Buoso, to crawl along the path as he has done. The narrator notes the constant change, and identifies Sciancato, who alone of the first three did not change.

**Canto XXVI:**
The narrator laments Florence, whose name spreads over Hell due to its citizens found among the plunderers. He forebodes future suffering for Florence. They depart the depth, scaling the rocky steps. The narrator sees the eighth chasm shining with countless flames, like fireflies. Each flame envelops a sinner, concealing their form. The narrator, leaning over the bridge, asks Virgil who is in the flame that is parted at the summit, like the funeral pile of the Theban brothers. Virgil replies it is Ulysses and Diomede, enduring penal tortures together, deploring the ambush of the Trojan horse, the guile that reft Achilles from Deidamia, and the stratagem that stole the Palladium. The narrator eagerly asks to speak to them. Virgil agrees but tells him to refrain his tongue, as he will question them, knowing that as Greeks, they might shun discourse with the narrator.
When the flame arrives, Virgil addresses the two spirits, asking one to unfold how death overtook him. The greater horn of the flame rolls and speaks, identifying itself as Ulysses. He recounts that after escaping Circe, neither love for his son, father, nor Penelope could overcome his zeal to explore the world. He sailed into the illimitable main with his small band, past the Pillars of Hercules. He exhorted his aging companions not to refuse to explore the unpeopled world, reminding them they were formed for virtue and knowledge, not to live like brutes. They turned their poop to the dawn, making oars their wings, gaining on the left. After five lunar cycles, a dim, lofty mountain appeared. Joy turned to mourning as a whirlwind struck their vessel, whirling it thrice, then lifting the poop and sinking the prow, and the booming billow closed over them.

**Canto XXVII:**
The flame, having spoken, stills its light and passes on. Another flame approaches, from which a confused sound issues. The sound is compared to the Sicilian bull. The flame speaks, recognizing the narrator's Lombard phrase and asking if Romagna is at peace or war, as he is from its mountains. Virgil prompts the narrator to reply, as the spirit is Latian. The narrator replies that Romagna is never without war in its tyrants' bosoms. He describes the current state of various cities: Ravenna is steadfast under Polenta's eagle; the Malatesta family (old and young mastiffs) still tear Montagna; Lamone and Santerno are under the inconstant lion of the snowy lair; Cesena lives between tyranny and liberty. The narrator then asks the spirit to identify himself. The flame roars, then speaks, stating that if he thought his answer would reach someone who could return to the world, he would remain silent. But since no one returns from this depth, he will speak without fear of infamy.
The spirit, Guido da Montefeltro, was a man of arms who later became a Franciscan friar, hoping to make amends. His hope would have succeeded, but Pope Boniface VIII, whom he curses, seduced him back into sin. Guido describes himself as cunning like a fox. Boniface, waging war against Christians, sought Guido's counsel to defeat the Colonna family at Penestrino, promising absolution for any offense and claiming power over heaven and hell. Guido, deeming silence more perilous, advised Boniface to make ""Large promise with performance scant"" to triumph. When Guido died, Saint Francis came for his soul, but a dark cherub claimed him, stating that no power can absolve the impenitent, and that repentance and will cannot coexist if one wills the sin. The cherub bore Guido to Minos, who condemned him to the fire for his deceitful counsel. The flame, having finished, parts in dolour, and they move to another arch.

**Canto XXVIII:**
The narrator struggles to describe the horrific wounds and blood he sees in the ninth chasm, stating no words can equal the sight. He compares it to the combined bloodshed of many historical battles, yet finds this chasm more terrible. He sees a spirit torn from chin to hinder passage, his entrails dangling. This spirit, Mohammed, lays bare his breast and cries, ""Now mark how I do rip me! lo! How is Mohammed mangled!"" He explains that he and Ali (who walks before him, face cleft from chin to forelock) and all others here sowed ""scandal and schism"" in life and are thus rent by a fiend with a sword, their gashes closing only to be reopened each time they complete the circuit. Mohammed asks the narrator why he lingers. Virgil explains the narrator is alive and on a divine mission. Over a hundred spirits, amazed, pause to listen. Mohammed warns the narrator to tell Dolcino to arm himself with food, lest he soon follow him here.
Another spirit, Piero da Medicina, with a pierced throat, mutilated nostrils, and a lopt ear, advances and bares his windpipe. He asks the narrator to tell Guido and Angelo of Fano that they will be cast forth from life and drowned near Cattolica by a treacherous tyrant. He identifies the ""one-eyed traitor"" (Malatestino) who will bring them to conference and then kill them. The narrator asks who this traitor is. Piero points to a fellow spirit, Curio, whose tongue was cut for advising Caesar that delay was harmful. Then, Mosca de' Lamberti, maimed of both hands, lifts his bleeding stumps and cries to be remembered, for his words ""The deed once done there is an end"" brought sorrow to the Tuscan race. The narrator adds, ""Ay, and death to thine own tribe."" Mosca hurries off in madness.
The narrator then sees a headless trunk bearing its severed head lantern-wise in its hand, which looks at them and says, ""Woe's me!"" This spirit, Bertrand de Born, explains that he gave King John mischievous counsel, setting father and son at mutual war, and for parting those so closely knit, his brain is parted from its source, carried in his hand as retribution.

**Canto XXIX:**
The narrator's eyes are overwhelmed by the multitude of wounded spirits. Virgil urges him onward, reminding him of the valley's length and the limited time. The narrator explains he was looking for a spirit of his blood, Geri of Bello, who was killed violently and unavenged. Virgil says he saw Geri menacingly point at the narrator but didn't mention it because the narrator was focused on Bertrand de Born. The narrator believes Geri's unavenged death made him contemptuous and speechless.
They reach the last cloister of Malebolge, where a volley of lamentations assails them, forcing the narrator to cover his ears. The torment is compared to all the maladies of Valdichiana, Sardinia, and Maremma's fen combined, and the stench is dire. They descend to the left. The narrator sees spirits piled in stacks, some lying on bellies, some on shoulders, others crawling. Two spirits sit propped against each other, covered in a tetter from head to foot, furiously scratching themselves with keen nails, like grooms currying horses. Virgil asks one if any Latian-born are among them. The weeping spirit replies both are from Latium and asks who the narrator is. Virgil explains he is guiding a living man through Hell. The spirits tremble. The narrator asks them to identify themselves. One, Griffolino d'Arezzo, says he was burned for alchemy, but that is not why he is here. He told Albero of Sienna in sport that he could fly, and Albero, wanting the secret, had him burned when he couldn't deliver. Minos condemned him here for alchemy. The narrator comments on the frivolity of Sienna. The other leprous spirit, Capocchio, confirms he is a ghost of Capocchio, who forged transmuted metals by alchemy, and recognizes the narrator as one he aped creative nature with.

**Canto XXX:**
The narrator describes the frenzies of Athamas and Hecuba, then sees two pale, naked ghosts scampering wildly. One, Gianni Schicchi, reaches Capocchio and bites his neck, dragging him. The other, Myrrha, who burned with unholy flame for her father and assumed a false shape to commit sin, is also seen. Gianni Schicchi counterfeited Donati's features for a false testament. The narrator then sees a dropsical spirit, Adamo, shaped like a lute, gasping for water. Adamo laments his craving for a single drop of water, tormented by the memory of Casentino's rills. He confesses that he falsified the florin with three carats of alloy in Romena, for which he was burned. He wishes to see Guido, Alessandro, or their brother, but is fettered.
The narrator asks about two smoking spirits next to Adamo. Adamo identifies them as the ""false accuser of the Hebrew youth"" (Potiphar's wife) and Sinon, the false Greek from Troy, both suffering from sharp fever. Sinon, galled by Adamo's words, strikes Adamo's paunch, which resounds like a drum. Adamo returns the blow. They exchange bitter insults, accusing each other of their respective sins (false coining for Adamo, false testimony for Sinon regarding the Trojan Horse). The narrator is fixed on listening, but Virgil admonishes him, saying such wrangling is for ""vulgar minds."" The narrator is filled with shame. Virgil comforts him, saying a less grievous fault might expiate less shame, and advises him to cast off sorrow and remember Virgil is always by his side if he encounters such arguments again.

**Canto XXXI:**
The narrator and Virgil turn their back on the vale of woe, crossing a mound in dim twilight. A horn sounds, its peal making thunder feeble. The narrator sees what he first mistakes for lofty towers. Virgil corrects him, explaining they are giants, immersed from the navel downward around the bank of the pit. As they approach, the narrator's error flees, replaced by fear. The shore is turreted with these horrible giants, whom Jove still threatens. The narrator sees the face, shoulders, breast, belly, and arms of one, noting his immense size, comparable to St. Peter's pine. This giant shouts incomprehensible words: ""Raphel bai ameth sabi almi."" Virgil identifies him as Nimrod, whose ill counsel caused the confusion of tongues, and advises the narrator not to waste words on him, as he understands no one.
They turn left and find another, fiercer, huger giant, Ephialtes, fettered by a chain that binds him from neck to arm. Virgil explains Ephialtes tried to fight Jove and is thus requited. The narrator wishes to see Briareus. Virgil says they will see Antaeus, who is unfettered and speaks, and will place them at the deepest guilt. Briareus is further on, chained like Ephialtes but more fell. Ephialtes shakes violently. They reach Antaeus, who issues five ells from the cave without his head. Virgil addresses Antaeus, recalling his strength against Hannibal and his lion spoils, and asks him to place them down in Cocytus, where numbing cold locks it up, promising Antaeus renown in the upper world. Antaeus stretches his hands, catches Virgil, who then clasps the narrator, making them one burden. Antaeus stoops like the leaning tower of Carisenda, then lightly places them in the abyss where Lucifer ingulfs Judas, and rises like a mast.

**Canto XXXII:**
The narrator, wishing for rough rhymes to describe this ""hole of sorrow,"" invokes the Muses. They stand in the dark pit, far below the giants. A voice warns the narrator not to tread on the heads of his ""poor brethren."" The narrator sees a lake of ice, thicker than any frozen river, where spirits are blue-pinched and shrined, moving their teeth like storks, their faces downcast. He sees two spirits so strictly joined that their hairs are mingled. He asks their identity. They bend their necks, and tears distill onto their lips, frozen there. They clash like enraged goats. One spirit, whose ears are reft by the cold, identifies the two joined spirits as the sons of Alberto from the Bisenzio valley, who issued from one body. He says Caina (the first ring of Cocytus) holds no one more worthy of congealment, not Mordred, nor Focaccia, nor Mascheroni. He identifies himself as Camiccione and awaits his kinsman Carlino, whose guilt will wash out his own.
As they journey toward the center, the narrator accidentally kicks the face of a spirit. The spirit, weeping, exclaims, ""Wherefore dost bruise me? Unless thy errand be some fresh revenge For Montaperto, wherefore troublest me?"" The narrator asks Virgil to wait, then demands the spirit's name. The spirit asks who the narrator is, roaming Antenora (the second ring) with such force. The narrator replies he is living and can bring the spirit fame. The spirit rejects this, saying he desires the contrary. The narrator seizes his scalp, threatening to pull out his hair. Another spirit cries, ""What ails thee, Bocca?"" (Bocca degli Abati). The narrator tells Bocca he will bear true tidings of him to his shame. Bocca replies, ""Tell what thou list,"" but asks the narrator to also speak of ""Him of Duera"" (Buoso da Duera), who wails for French gold, and Beccaria, and Soldanieri, Ganellon, and Tribaldello (who opened Faenza).
They leave him. The narrator sees two spirits pent in one hollow by the ice, one's head serving as a cowl for the other. The uppermost spirit ravenously gnaws the other's brain. The narrator asks the cause of such hate, promising to repay him in the world above if his grievance is just.

**Canto XXXIII:**
The gnawing sinner, Count Ugolino, lifts his jaws from Archbishop Ruggieri's head, wipes them on the mangled hair, and agrees to speak, though it renews his sorrow. He identifies himself as Count Ugolino and the other as Archbishop Ruggieri. He explains that trusting Ruggieri's ill thoughts led to his capture and murder. He then recounts the cruel manner of his death: imprisoned in a tower (now called Famine) with his sons, he dreamt of Ruggieri hunting a wolf and its whelps (Ugolino and his sons). He awoke to his sons weeping and asking for bread. He heard the tower locked up, felt like stone, and could not weep or speak for a day and a night. When a faint beam entered, he saw his own agony reflected in his sons' faces. He bit his hands in anguish, and his sons, thinking he was hungry, offered their own flesh. He remained silent. On the fourth day, his son Geddo died at his feet. Between the fifth and sixth days, his other three sons died one by one. Then, blind, he groped over them for three days, calling their names, until ""fasting got The mastery of grief."" Having spoken, he fastens his teeth on Ruggieri's skull once more. The narrator then curses Pisa for its cruelty, wishing for its destruction, arguing that even if Ugolino was a traitor, his young children were innocent.
They pass to another part of the ice, where spirits are reversed, not on their feet, their tears frozen into crystal vizors, increasing their anguish. The narrator feels a breath of wind and asks Virgil its source, thinking all vapor quenched. Virgil replies he will soon see the cause. A spirit in the ice, Friar Alberigo, asks them to remove the frozen veil from his face so he can vent his grief. The narrator agrees, promising to descend to the lowest ice if he fails. Alberigo identifies himself as one who plucked ""fruitage from the evil garden"" and is now repaid. The narrator asks if he is dead. Alberigo explains that Ptolomea (this region) has the privilege that souls often fall here before their bodies die. The moment a soul betrays, a fiend takes over its body in the upper world, while the soul falls here. He says the body of a ghost who winters behind him (Branca Doria) may still appear above. The narrator expresses disbelief, as Branca Doria is still alive. Alberigo explains that Branca Doria left a demon in his stead in his own body, as did one of his kin who wrought treachery with him. Alberigo asks the narrator to open his eyes, but the narrator refuses, deeming ""ill manners were best courtesy to him."" The narrator then curses the Genoese for their perfidy, noting that Branca Doria's soul is in Cocytus while his body still lives on earth.

**Canto XXXIV:**
Virgil announces the approach of ""Hell's Monarch."" The narrator sees what appears to be a windmill in the distance, then draws behind Virgil for shelter from the wind. They arrive where souls are whelmed under transparent ice, some prone, some upright, some arched. Virgil points out ""Dis!"" (Lucifer), telling the narrator to arm his heart with strength. The narrator is frozen and faint, neither dead nor living, unable to describe his state. Lucifer, the ""emperor, who sways The realm of sorrow,"" stands mid-breast from the ice, immense in stature. He has three faces on his head: vermilion in front, wan and yellow on the right, and dark (like those from the Nile) on the left. Under each face are two enormous, bat-like wings, which he flaps, creating three winds that freeze Cocytus. He weeps from six eyes, tears mixed with bloody foam distilling down three chins. At each of his three mouths, he champs a sinner. Virgil identifies the uppermost, most tormented sinner as Judas Iscariot (head within, feet without). The other two, whose heads are under, are Brutus (who writhes silently) and Cassius (large of limb).
Virgil states that night re-ascends, and it is time to depart. The narrator clasps Virgil around the neck. Virgil, when Lucifer's wings are open, catches his shaggy sides and descends from pile to pile between the thick fell and jagged ice. When he reaches the point where Lucifer's thigh turns on his haunches, Virgil, with pain and struggle, turns his head where his feet stood before, grappling at the fell as one who mounts. The narrator thinks they are turning back into Hell. Virgil, panting, explains that this is the way they must depart from such extreme evil. They emerge at a rocky opening, and Virgil places the narrator on a brink to sit. The narrator, raising his eyes, expects to see Lucifer as before but now sees him with legs held upward.
The narrator asks Virgil to explain: where is the ice now? How is Lucifer reversed? How has the sun made its transit from eve to morn so quickly? Virgil explains that the narrator was on the other side of the center (where Virgil grasped Lucifer) as they descended. When Virgil turned, they passed the center of the earth, the point to which all heavy substance is dragged. They are now in the opposite hemisphere, where Christ died. Morn rises here when evening sets on the other side. Lucifer still stands fixed as at first; he fell from heaven on this part, and the earth, fearing him, veiled herself with the sea and retired to the other hemisphere, leaving this vacant space. Beneath them, a brooklet descends along a hollow rock, discovered by sound, not sight. By this hidden way, Virgil and the narrator enter to return to the ""fair world."" Heedless of repose, they climb, Virgil first, until the ""beautiful lights of heav'n Dawn'd through a circular opening in the cave."" Thus issuing, they again behold the stars."
The Great Gatsby-F. Scott Fitzgerald,"Nick Carraway, a young man from the Middle West, moves to West Egg, Long Island, in the spring of 1922 to learn the bond business. He rents a modest house next door to a colossal mansion owned by the mysterious Jay Gatsby. Across the bay, in the more fashionable East Egg, live Nick's second cousin, Daisy Buchanan, and her wealthy, arrogant husband, Tom Buchanan, a former Yale football star.

Nick visits the Buchanans for dinner and meets Jordan Baker, a professional golfer. During dinner, Tom expresses racist views, and Daisy makes cynical remarks about her daughter, wishing her to be a ""beautiful little fool."" A phone call interrupts their meal, and Jordan reveals to Nick that Tom has a mistress in New York. Daisy appears tense and later confides in Nick about her unhappiness and cynicism. After dinner, as Nick returns home, he sees Gatsby for the first time, standing on his lawn and stretching his arms toward a distant green light at the end of a dock across the bay.

Some time later, Tom forces Nick to accompany him to the ""valley of ashes,"" a desolate industrial area, where Tom introduces Nick to his mistress, Myrtle Wilson. Myrtle is the wife of George Wilson, a spiritless garage owner. Tom arranges to meet Myrtle in New York. In the city, Myrtle changes into an elaborate dress, buys a dog, and hosts a small, raucous party in her apartment. Her sister, Catherine, and the McKees, a couple from downstairs, are present. During the party, Catherine tells Nick a rumor that Gatsby is a relative of Kaiser Wilhelm and that Tom and Myrtle despise their spouses, with Catherine falsely claiming Daisy is Catholic and thus cannot divorce. Myrtle recounts her regretful marriage to George. As the party becomes increasingly drunken, Myrtle provokes Tom by repeatedly shouting Daisy's name, leading Tom to violently break her nose. Nick leaves the chaotic scene.

Throughout the summer, Gatsby hosts lavish parties at his mansion, to which guests often come uninvited. Nick receives a formal invitation and attends one. He feels out of place and struggles to find his host. He reconnects with Jordan Baker, and they hear various rumors about Gatsby's past—that he killed a man, was a German spy, or was in the American army. While searching for Gatsby, they encounter a drunk man with ""owl-eyed spectacles"" in Gatsby's library, who is astonished that the books are real. Later, Nick meets Gatsby, who recognizes him from the war. Gatsby's smile is described as uniquely reassuring. Gatsby is called away by a phone call from Chicago. Jordan tells Nick that Gatsby claimed to be an ""Oxford man"" but she doesn't believe it. Gatsby later asks Jordan to convey a ""big request"" to Nick. As Nick leaves the party, he witnesses a car accident involving the owl-eyed man, who was not driving the car that crashed.

Gatsby invites Nick to lunch. During their drive, Gatsby, aware of the rumors about him, shares his ""God's truth"": he is the son of wealthy deceased Midwesterners, educated at Oxford, and lived like a ""young rajah"" in Europe. He shows Nick a war medal from Montenegro and an Oxford photograph as proof. Gatsby then reveals his ""big request"" will be explained by Jordan. He also demonstrates his influence by getting out of a speeding ticket with a white card. At lunch, Gatsby introduces Nick to Meyer Wolfshiem, a gambler who, Gatsby reveals, fixed the 1919 World's Series. Wolfshiem speaks highly of Gatsby, claiming he ""made him"" from nothing. Tom Buchanan unexpectedly appears at the restaurant, and Gatsby mysteriously disappears.

Jordan then tells Nick the story of Gatsby and Daisy. Five years prior, in 1917 Louisville, Daisy Fay was a popular young woman who had a romance with Lieutenant Jay Gatsby. Daisy's family prevented her from saying goodbye to Gatsby before he went overseas. She later married Tom Buchanan, who gave her a $350,000 pearl necklace. On the eve of her wedding, Daisy received a letter (presumably from Gatsby), got drunk, and wanted to call off the wedding, but was eventually persuaded to go through with it. After their honeymoon, Tom had a car accident with a chambermaid, breaking her arm, which made the papers. Jordan reveals that Gatsby bought his mansion specifically to be across the bay from Daisy, hoping she would wander into one of his parties. His request is for Nick to invite Daisy to his house for tea so Gatsby can ""come over.""

Nick agrees to arrange the tea. Gatsby, visibly nervous and pale, prepares his house by having Nick's lawn cut and filling his own mansion with lights. On the day of the tea, it rains heavily. Gatsby, dressed in a white flannel suit, is extremely anxious, almost leaving before Daisy arrives. Daisy arrives, ecstatic, and asks Nick if he's in love with her. Gatsby and Daisy have an awkward reunion, with Gatsby nearly knocking over a clock in his nervousness. Nick leaves them alone for a while. When he returns, Daisy is crying tears of joy, and Gatsby is glowing. Gatsby gives them a tour of his lavish house, including his collection of expensive shirts, which makes Daisy sob, saying she's never seen such beautiful shirts. Gatsby points out the green light at the end of Daisy's dock, realizing its symbolic significance for him has now vanished. Nick sees a photograph of Dan Cody, Gatsby's deceased mentor. Gatsby receives a cryptic phone call. Klipspringer, ""the boarder,"" plays the piano. Nick observes Gatsby, realizing Daisy, in her reality, falls short of Gatsby's idealized dream of her.

Gatsby's parties abruptly cease. He dismisses his gossipy servants and replaces them with people recommended by Wolfshiem, explaining that Daisy now visits frequently in the afternoons. Gatsby calls Nick, asking him to lunch at Daisy's house, and Daisy herself confirms the invitation. During a sweltering lunch at the Buchanans', Daisy openly kisses Gatsby when Tom leaves the room, and murmurs ""You know I love you."" Daisy's young daughter, Pammy, is brought in, and Gatsby looks at her with surprise, as if he hadn't believed in her existence. Daisy tells Gatsby he ""always look so cool,"" and Tom realizes their affair.

Tom insists they all go to town. Daisy suggests they take Gatsby's car, but Tom insists on driving Gatsby's car, making Nick and Jordan ride with him in his coupé, while Daisy rides with Gatsby. As they drive, Tom reveals he has been investigating Gatsby, dismissing his Oxford claim and accusing him of being a bootlegger. They stop for gas at Wilson's garage. George Wilson is sick and distraught, revealing he has ""wised up to something funny"" and plans to take Myrtle West, having locked her upstairs. Myrtle is seen peering from a window, her eyes filled with jealous terror, mistakenly fixed on Jordan Baker, whom she believes is Tom's wife.

At the Plaza Hotel, Tom confronts Gatsby, accusing him of having an affair with Daisy and being a ""common swindler"" who made his money bootlegging alcohol through drugstores. Gatsby counters by saying Daisy never loved Tom and only married him because Gatsby was poor. Daisy, under pressure, admits she loved Tom once, but also loved Gatsby. She then cries, ""Oh, you want too much! I love you now—isn’t that enough?"" Tom presses her, reminding her of their past. Daisy ultimately cannot bring herself to say she never loved Tom. Gatsby's dream seems to crumble. Tom, with ""magnanimous scorn,"" tells Daisy to go home with Gatsby in Gatsby's car, declaring Gatsby's ""presumptuous little flirtation is over."" Nick realizes it's his 30th birthday.

As Tom, Nick, and Jordan drive back in Tom's coupé, they pass the valley of ashes. Michaelis, who runs a coffee shop there, recounts the events of the afternoon: George Wilson, having locked Myrtle upstairs, was distraught. Myrtle, after a heated argument with George, rushed out into the road and was struck and killed by a yellow car, which did not stop. Tom, arriving at the accident scene, sees Myrtle's body. He quickly tells Wilson that the yellow car he was driving earlier was not his, and that he had just arrived from New York in a blue coupé, subtly deflecting suspicion from himself and onto Gatsby. Later, Nick sees Tom and Daisy sitting intimately in their kitchen, appearing to conspire.

Nick finds Gatsby waiting outside Daisy's house all night, hoping she will signal him. Gatsby tells Nick that Daisy was driving the yellow car when it hit Myrtle, but he intends to take the blame. He explains Daisy was nervous and wanted to drive, and Myrtle rushed out, seemingly trying to speak to them. Gatsby says Daisy ""stepped on it"" and he had to pull the emergency brake. Nick leaves Gatsby standing vigil.

The next morning, Nick urges Gatsby to go away, fearing his car will be traced, but Gatsby refuses to leave Daisy. Gatsby reveals more about his past with Daisy: he was a penniless officer who let Daisy believe he was wealthy, taking her under ""false pretences."" He fell deeply in love, feeling ""married to her."" While he was at Oxford after the war, Daisy, feeling societal pressure, married Tom. Gatsby describes his desperate return to Louisville, searching for a trace of her.

Gatsby's gardener asks to drain the pool for autumn, but Gatsby, who has never used it all summer, tells him to wait. Nick, feeling a deep connection, tells Gatsby he is ""worth the whole damn bunch put together."" Later that day, Gatsby puts on his bathing suit and goes to the pool on a pneumatic mattress. George Wilson, having spent the night distraught and searching for the yellow car, eventually makes his way to West Egg, having learned Gatsby's name. The chauffeur hears shots. Nick arrives to find Gatsby's body floating in the pool, and the gardener discovers Wilson's body nearby in the grass.

In the aftermath, police and reporters swarm Gatsby's house. Catherine, Myrtle's sister, lies at the inquest, stating Myrtle never knew Gatsby and was happy with her husband, to avoid scandal. Nick feels responsible for Gatsby, as no one else seems to care. Daisy and Tom have left, taking their luggage and leaving no forwarding address. Nick tries to contact Meyer Wolfshiem, who refuses to get involved, citing ""important business."" A call comes for Gatsby about a business associate in trouble, further hinting at his illicit dealings.

Gatsby's father, Henry C. Gatz, arrives from Minnesota, a solemn old man who is dismayed but also immensely proud of his son's success. He shows Nick a photograph of Gatsby's house and a childhood book, ""Hopalong Cassidy,"" which contains Gatsby's rigorous schedule for self-improvement. Despite Nick's efforts, almost no one attends Gatsby's funeral except his father, Nick, a minister, a few servants, and the owl-eyed man.

Nick decides to return West, feeling disillusioned with the East. He has a final, strained conversation with Jordan Baker, who reveals she is engaged and accuses Nick of being a ""bad driver"" himself, dishonest despite his claims of honesty. Nick later encounters Tom Buchanan on Fifth Avenue. Tom defiantly admits he told Wilson that Gatsby owned the yellow car, believing Gatsby ""had it coming to him"" for Myrtle's death. Nick realizes that Tom and Daisy are ""careless people"" who ""smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness... and let other people clean up the mess they had made.""

Nick leaves Gatsby's abandoned house, erasing an obscene word scrawled on the steps. He reflects on Gatsby's ""incorruptible dream"" and his wonder at the green light, realizing that Gatsby's dream of the past was already behind him, and that people are ceaselessly ""borne back ceaselessly into the past."""
The Iliad-Homer,"The provided text, ""The Iliad,"" details a specific period of the Trojan War, focusing primarily on the wrath of Achilles and its consequences, culminating in the death of Hector and the return of his body.

**Book I: The Contention of Achilles and Agamemnon.**
The narrative opens in the tenth year of the siege of Troy. The Greeks have sacked neighboring towns, taking two beautiful captives: Chryseïs, allotted to Agamemnon, and Briseïs, allotted to Achilles. Chryses, a priest of Apollo and father of Chryseïs, arrives at the Greek camp with gifts to ransom his daughter. Agamemnon insolently refuses and dismisses him. Chryses then prays to Apollo for vengeance, and the god inflicts a pestilence upon the Greeks.

Achilles calls a council, where the prophet Chalcas reveals that Apollo's rage is due to Agamemnon's refusal to release Chryseïs. Agamemnon is compelled to return his captive but, in a fit of fury, seizes Briseïs from Achilles as compensation. Enraged and dishonored, Achilles withdraws himself and his Myrmidon forces from the Greek army, vowing not to fight.

Achilles complains to his mother, Thetis, a sea goddess. She ascends to Olympus and supplicates Jupiter (Jove) to grant victory to the Trojans, thereby making the Greeks realize the severe wrong done to her son. Jupiter grants her request, which incenses Juno, his wife and sister. A heated debate ensues between Jupiter and Juno, eventually pacified by their son, Vulcan.

The events of this book span twenty-two days: nine days for the plague, one for the council and quarrel, and twelve days during Jupiter's absence with the Æthiopians before Thetis presents her petition.

**Book II: The Trial of the Army, and Catalogue of the Forces.**
To fulfill Thetis's request, Jupiter sends a deceitful dream to Agamemnon, disguised as the wise Nestor. The dream urges Agamemnon to lead the Greeks into battle, promising him that Troy will fall immediately. Agamemnon, deluded by this vision, decides to test the army's morale. He proposes to the Greek princes that they should return home, expecting them to object and rally the troops.

When Agamemnon presents this proposal to the assembled army, the soldiers, weary from nine years of war and the recent plague, unanimously agree to abandon the siege and rush to prepare their ships for departure. Juno, observing this, sends Pallas (Minerva) to Ulysses, urging him to stop the flight. Ulysses, taking Agamemnon's royal scepter, moves through the ranks, persuading the leaders and chastising the common soldiers. He silences Thersites, a loud and insolent commoner who publicly criticizes Agamemnon, by striking him with the scepter.

The assembly is recalled. Nestor advises Agamemnon to organize the troops by their nations and tribes before battle. Agamemnon agrees, and the Greek forces are marshaled. The narrative then provides a detailed ""Catalogue of Ships,"" listing the various Greek contingents, their leaders, and their origins (e.g., Boeotia, Athens, Sparta, Crete, Pylos). Notably, Achilles' Myrmidons are present but remain inactive due to their leader's wrath.

Meanwhile, Iris, sent by Jupiter, warns the Trojan chiefs (disguised as Priam's son, Polites) of the approaching Greek army. Hector, the Trojan leader, immediately gathers all Trojan and allied forces, including Dardans, Lycians, Paeonians, and others. Both armies prepare for battle on the plain before Troy.

**Book III: The Duel of Menelaus and Paris.**
The Greek and Trojan armies advance, the Trojans with shouts, the Greeks in silence. Paris, the cause of the war, steps forward from the Trojan ranks and challenges any Greek to single combat. Menelaus, the Spartan king whose wife Helen was abducted by Paris, joyfully accepts. Paris, however, shrinks back in fear at the sight of Menelaus. Hector rebukes Paris for his cowardice.

Paris, shamed, then proposes a single combat between himself and Menelaus to decide the war, with Helen and all the treasures she brought to Troy as the prize. Hector conveys this challenge to the Greeks, and Menelaus accepts. A solemn truce is agreed upon, and Priam, the aged king of Troy, comes to the battlefield to swear the oaths for the Trojans, accompanied by Agamemnon for the Greeks.

Iris, disguised as Laodice, goes to Helen in the palace and urges her to come to the Scaean Gate to witness the duel. Helen, filled with longing for her former life, joins Priam and the Trojan elders on the walls. From there, she identifies prominent Greek leaders for Priam, including Agamemnon, Ulysses, and Ajax.

The duel begins. Paris throws his spear first, but it is deflected by Menelaus's shield. Menelaus throws his spear, which pierces Paris's shield and corslet, but Paris narrowly avoids a fatal wound. Menelaus then attacks with his sword, which shatters on Paris's helmet. Menelaus seizes Paris by his helmet-crest and begins to drag him towards the Greek lines. At this critical moment, Venus, Paris's divine protector, intervenes. She breaks the helmet strap, frees Paris, and, shrouding him in a cloud, transports him safely back to his perfumed chamber in Troy.

Venus then, disguised as an old woman, compels a reluctant Helen to join Paris in his chamber. Helen initially scorns Paris for his cowardice but eventually succumbs to Venus's pressure and embraces him. Back on the battlefield, Agamemnon declares Menelaus the victor and demands the immediate return of Helen and the treasures, along with the agreed-upon fine. The Greek army loudly applauds his demand.

**Book IV: The Breach of the Truce, and the First Battle.**
The gods convene on Olympus to discuss the war. Jupiter, seeing the truce broken, suggests ending the conflict peacefully by allowing Menelaus to reclaim Helen. This suggestion enrages Juno, who insists on the utter destruction of Troy. Jupiter, though annoyed by her persistent hatred, eventually yields to her will, warning her that he may one day destroy her favored cities in return. He then sends Minerva (Pallas) to break the truce definitively and reignite the battle.

Minerva descends to the battlefield, disguised as Laodocus, a Trojan warrior. She approaches Pandarus, a skilled Trojan archer, and persuades him to shoot an arrow at Menelaus, promising him glory and rich rewards from Paris. Pandarus, swayed by the goddess, shoots an arrow that wounds Menelaus. The wound is not fatal, as Minerva subtly deflects the arrow from a vital spot, but it is enough to break the truce.

Agamemnon is deeply distressed by Menelaus's wound and the treachery of the Trojans. He expresses his fear that the Greeks will abandon the war if Menelaus dies. Machaon, the Greek physician, is summoned and successfully extracts the arrow and heals Menelaus.

Agamemnon then moves through the Greek ranks, rallying his troops. He praises valiant leaders like Idomeneus and the Ajaces, and sternly reproves those who seem hesitant, such as Ulysses and Diomed, reminding them of their duty and past glories. Inspired by their king, the Greeks prepare for battle.

The armies clash fiercely. Antilochus kills Echepolus. Ajax kills Simoisius. Ulysses kills Democoon. Apollo, seeing the Trojans falter, encourages them. The battle becomes a bloody melee, with many heroes falling on both sides. Pyrus kills Diores, and Thoas kills Pyrus. The field is covered with dead and wounded, and the conflict rages with immense fury.

**Book V: The Acts of Diomed.**
Pallas (Minerva) inspires Diomed with extraordinary strength and courage, making him shine with a divine light, intending to raise his fame above all other Greeks. Diomed immediately enters the fray, killing Phegeus and Idæus, sons of Dares. Pallas then restrains Mars, the god of war, and instructs Diomed that he can distinguish gods from mortals and is permitted to wound Venus if she enters the battle, but must avoid all other deities.

Diomed continues his rampage, killing Odius, Phaestus, Scamandrius, Phereclus, Pedaeus, and Hypsenor. Pandarus wounds Diomed with an arrow, but Pallas heals him and reinforces her earlier instructions. Æneas, seeing Pandarus's success, joins him in a chariot to confront Diomed. Diomed kills Pandarus with his spear, then throws a massive stone that shatters Æneas's hip.

Venus, Æneas's mother, rushes to her son's aid, covering him with her veil to protect him. Diomed, remembering Pallas's instruction, pursues Venus and wounds her hand with his spear. Venus, shrieking, drops Æneas and flees to Olympus with the help of Iris, complaining to Dione and Jupiter about being wounded by a mortal. Jupiter gently rebukes her, telling her to leave war to Mars and Pallas and focus on love.

Apollo rescues Æneas, taking him to his temple in Troy where Latona and Phoebe heal him. Apollo then creates a phantom of Æneas to maintain the Trojan morale and urges Mars to re-enter the battle and rally the Trojans. Sarpedon, a Lycian ally, also rebukes Hector for his perceived inaction, spurring him to fight. Hector, shamed, rallies his troops.

The real Æneas, fully healed, returns to the battle. Tlepolemus, son of Hercules, challenges Sarpedon, son of Jupiter. They exchange spears; Sarpedon kills Tlepolemus but is wounded in the thigh. Jupiter, though saddened, allows fate to take its course. Ulysses, enraged by Tlepolemus's death, slaughters many Lycians.

Hector and Mars drive the Greeks back. Diomed, seeing Mars, advises a tactical retreat. Ajax makes a fierce stand, killing several Trojans, but is eventually forced to give ground under a shower of darts. Juno and Minerva prepare to intervene again, but Jupiter sends Iris to warn them against defying his will, threatening severe punishment. They reluctantly return to Olympus.

Minerva, however, later inspires Diomed to attack Mars directly. Diomed, guided by Pallas, wounds Mars in the groin with his spear. Mars bellows in pain and flees to Olympus, where Jupiter rebukes him for his constant warring. Paeon heals Mars. Juno and Pallas, having completed their task, return to the other gods.

**Book VI: The Episodes of Glaucus and Diomed, and of Hector and Andromache.**
With the gods having withdrawn from direct combat, the Greeks gain the upper hand. Ajax kills Acamas. Diomed kills Axylus and his servant Calesius. Euryalus kills Dresus, Opheltius, and two sons of Bucolion. Other Greek heroes also achieve kills, including Polypoetes, Ulysses, Teucer, Nestor's son, Agamemnon, Eurypylus, and Leitus.

Menelaus captures Adrastus, who begs for his life and offers ransom. Menelaus is inclined to spare him, but Agamemnon intervenes, urging merciless slaughter, and kills Adrastus himself. Nestor then encourages the Greeks to continue fighting and not to stop for plunder until the enemy is routed.

Helenus, the chief augur of Troy, advises Hector to return to the city. He instructs Hector to tell his mother, Hecuba, to lead the Trojan matrons in a solemn procession to Minerva's temple, offering a precious mantle and twelve heifers, to entreat the goddess to remove Diomed from the fight. Hector agrees, rallies his troops, and departs for Troy.

Meanwhile, Glaucus, a Lycian ally, and Diomed meet between the armies. Diomed asks Glaucus's lineage, stating he avoids fighting gods. Glaucus recounts his ancestry, tracing it to Bellerophon, a hero who overcame many challenges. Recognizing that their grandfathers, Oeneus and Bellerophon, were guest-friends, Diomed and Glaucus agree not to fight each other. As a token of their renewed ancestral friendship, they exchange armor, with Glaucus foolishly trading his golden armor for Diomed's bronze.

Hector arrives in Troy and is greeted by his mother, Hecuba, who offers him wine. He refuses, deeming himself too stained with blood for sacred rites. He then conveys Helenus's instructions to Hecuba, who leads the Trojan women in their procession and prayers to Minerva, but their prayers are in vain.

Hector then goes to Paris's house, finding him polishing his armor. Hector sternly rebukes Paris for his idleness while Troy suffers. Paris, acknowledging his fault, agrees to return to battle. Helen also expresses her self-blame and sorrow.

Before returning to the field, Hector seeks his wife, Andromache, and their infant son, Astyanax, at the Scaean Gate. Andromache tearfully pleads with him to stay within the city walls, fearing for his life and the future of their son and Troy. Hector explains his duty to fight for his country and his honor, foreseeing Troy's eventual fall and Andromache's enslavement. He prays to Jupiter that Astyanax may become a great warrior. After a tender farewell, Hector and Paris rejoin the battle.

**Book VII: The Single Combat of Hector and Ajax.**
With Hector and Paris back in the field, the battle renews with increased ferocity. Paris kills Menestheus, Hector kills Eioneus, and Glaucus kills Iphinous. Minerva, concerned for the Greeks, descends from Olympus and meets Apollo near the Scaean Gate. They agree to halt the general engagement for the day and inspire Hector to challenge a Greek to single combat.

Helenus, the Trojan seer, divining the gods' will, advises Hector to issue this challenge. Hector steps forward and proposes a duel, stating that the victor will take the loser's armor, but the body must be returned for proper burial. The Greeks are initially silent, fearing Hector's might. Menelaus, enraged, volunteers, but Agamemnon restrains him, reminding him of Hector's superior strength.

Nestor then shames the Greeks for their hesitation, recounting his own youthful valor. Nine Greek chiefs, including Agamemnon, Diomed, Ajax Telamon, Oileus, Idomeneus, Meriones, Eurypylus, Thoas, and Ulysses, step forward to accept the challenge. Lots are cast, and Ajax Telamon is chosen.

Ajax arms himself in his formidable sevenfold shield and advances. Hector and Ajax exchange boasts. Hector throws his spear, which strikes Ajax's shield but does not pierce it. Ajax then throws his spear, piercing Hector's shield and corslet, grazing his flank. They then engage with swords. Hector throws a stone at Ajax's shield. Ajax retaliates with a larger stone, knocking Hector to the ground. Apollo quickly restores Hector's strength. As they prepare to resume fighting with swords, heralds from both sides, Idæus for Troy and Talthybius for Greece, intervene to stop the combat due to nightfall, declaring it a draw by divine will.

As a sign of mutual respect, Hector and Ajax exchange gifts: Hector gives Ajax a sword, and Ajax gives Hector a purple belt. Both heroes then return to their respective armies. The Trojans joyfully welcome Hector back to the city. The Greeks celebrate Ajax's prowess.

Agamemnon hosts a feast for the Greek chiefs. Nestor advises them to use the truce to burn their dead and to build a defensive wall, trench, and palisades around their camp and ships. Priam calls a council in Troy. Antenor proposes returning Helen and the treasures to end the war, but Paris refuses to return Helen, though he offers to return the treasures and add his own wealth. Priam then sends Idæus to the Greeks with Paris's offer and a request for a truce to bury the dead. Diomed rejects the offer of wealth but Agamemnon agrees to the truce for burial.

Both armies spend the next day performing funeral rites for their fallen comrades. The Greeks then build their fortifications. Neptune, seeing the wall being built without offerings to the gods, complains to Jupiter, fearing it will diminish the glory of the walls he and Apollo built for Laomedon. Jupiter assures Neptune that he will eventually destroy the Greek wall. That night, both armies feast, but Jupiter sends thunder and lightning to signify his displeasure with the Trojans.

**Book VIII: The Second Battle, and the Distress of the Greeks.**
At dawn, Jupiter convenes a council of the gods on Olympus. He sternly forbids any deity from intervening in the battle, threatening severe punishment (including being cast into Tartarus) for disobedience. Minerva is only permitted to offer counsel to the Greeks, not direct aid. Jupiter then takes his chariot to Mount Ida to oversee the battle from afar.

The armies clash. Jupiter weighs the fates of Greece and Troy in his golden scales; the Greek scale sinks. He then sends thunder and lightning to terrify the Greeks, causing them to retreat. Nestor's horse is wounded by Paris's arrow, putting the aged king in danger from Hector. Diomed rescues Nestor, but Ulysses flees to the ships. Diomed and Nestor confront Hector, but Jupiter sends another lightning bolt, forcing them to retreat. Hector boasts of his impending victory and his plan to burn the Greek ships.

Juno, distressed by the Greek losses, complains to Neptune, urging him to intervene, but Neptune refuses to defy Jupiter. Agamemnon, inspired by Juno, rallies the Greeks and prays to Jupiter for aid. Jupiter sends an eagle carrying a fawn as an omen, which encourages the Greeks.

Diomed leads a renewed charge, killing Agelaus. The Atridae, Ajaces, Meriones, Idomeneus, and Teucer follow. Teucer, protected by Ajax's shield, kills several Trojans with his arrows. However, when Teucer aims at Hector, Apollo deflects the arrow, and Hector retaliates by throwing a stone that breaks Teucer's bowstring, disabling him. Ajax and Mecistheus carry Teucer from the field.

The Trojans, emboldened by Jupiter's favor, drive the Greeks back towards their fortifications. Hector leads the charge. Juno and Minerva again prepare to intervene, but Iris, sent by Jupiter, warns them of Jupiter's wrath and threats of punishment. They reluctantly return to Olympus. Jupiter then confirms his prophecy to Juno: Hector will continue to triumph until Achilles returns to battle after Patroclus's death, at which point Hector will die and Troy will fall.

As night falls, the Trojans have driven the Greeks back to their ships. Hector calls a council and decides to camp on the plain outside the city, lighting numerous fires to prevent the Greeks from escaping by sea during the night. He plans a decisive assault on the ships at dawn. The Trojans feast and maintain watch throughout the night.

**Book IX: The Embassy to Achilles.**
The Greeks are in deep despair after the day's defeat, with the Trojan fires burning brightly near their ships. Agamemnon, overwhelmed, proposes abandoning the siege and returning to Greece. Diomed vehemently opposes this, declaring he will stay and fight even if all others leave. Nestor praises Diomed's courage and advises Agamemnon to strengthen the guards and call a council of elders. He then suggests sending an embassy to Achilles to appease his wrath with gifts and persuade him to return to battle.

Agamemnon agrees and offers an immense array of gifts to Achilles: ten talents of gold, twenty shining vases, seven sacred tripods, twelve swift horses, seven beautiful Lesbian captives (including Briseïs, whom he swears he never touched), and promises of more wealth if Troy falls, twenty Trojan women, one of his three daughters in marriage without a dowry, and the rule over seven rich cities.

Nestor selects Phoenix (Achilles' aged tutor), the mighty Ajax Telamon, and the wise Ulysses as ambassadors, accompanied by two heralds. They travel through the night to Achilles' tent, praying to Neptune. They find Achilles playing the lyre, with Patroclus listening. Achilles welcomes them as friends and offers them a feast.

Ulysses presents Agamemnon's offer, detailing the desperate situation of the Greeks and reminding Achilles of his father Peleus's advice to control his anger and be humane. Achilles, however, firmly rejects the offer. He reiterates his deep resentment towards Agamemnon for the dishonor and states that he values his life over glory. He announces his intention to sail home on the third day. He scorns Agamemnon's gifts and refuses his daughter in marriage. He invites Phoenix to stay with him, respecting his age.

Phoenix then tearfully recounts his own history as Achilles' tutor and appeals to Achilles' compassion, telling the story of Meleager, who refused to fight until his city was on the verge of destruction, only to receive no reward for his eventual intervention. Achilles acknowledges Phoenix as a second father but remains steadfast in his refusal to fight for Agamemnon.

Ajax then speaks, rebuking Achilles for his stubbornness and lack of pity for his suffering countrymen, emphasizing the common cause and the immense atonement offered. Achilles respects Ajax's words but maintains his anger against Agamemnon. He declares he will not return to battle until Hector reaches his own ships and sets them on fire.

The ambassadors return to Agamemnon's tent, leaving Phoenix with Achilles. Ulysses reports Achilles' unyielding refusal and his plan to depart. Diomed responds by asserting that they should not rely on Achilles but prepare to fight bravely at dawn. The Greeks make libations and then go to sleep.

**Book X: The Night-Adventure of Diomed and Ulysses.**
Agamemnon, unable to sleep due to anxiety, rises and goes to Nestor's tent, finding the old king also awake and armed. They discuss the dire situation of the Greek army. Nestor suggests waking other key leaders. Agamemnon goes to Menelaus, who is also awake with concern. Menelaus then goes to wake Ajax and Idomeneus. Nestor wakes Ulysses and Diomed.

The chiefs gather in a council of war near the night guards. Nestor proposes sending a spy into the Trojan camp to gather intelligence on their plans and dispositions. Diomed volunteers for this hazardous mission and chooses Ulysses as his companion. They arm themselves: Diomed with a shield and a simple helmet, Ulysses with a sword, bow, quiver, and a boar's-tusk helmet. Minerva sends a heron as a favorable omen, and they pray to Pallas for success.

Meanwhile, Hector also calls for a volunteer to spy on the Greek camp, offering Achilles' chariot and immortal horses as a reward. Dolon, a swift but not handsome Trojan youth, volunteers, explicitly asking for Achilles' horses. Hector swears an oath to grant them. Dolon disguises himself with a wolf's hide and a ferret's fur helmet and sets out.

Diomed and Ulysses spot Dolon. They let him pass a short distance, then pursue and capture him. Dolon, terrified, begs for his life and, under interrogation, reveals the Trojan dispositions: Hector and the Trojan peers are holding a council at Ilus' monument, the native Trojans are keeping watch by their fires, but the auxiliary forces (Paeonians, Carians, Caucons, Pelasgians, Leleges, Lycians, Mysians, Maeonians, Phrygians, Thracians) are sleeping without strict guard. He specifically mentions Rhesus, the Thracian king, who recently arrived with magnificent, white horses.

Diomed, despite Dolon's pleas, kills him with his sword, stating that a traitor should not be allowed to escape. Ulysses dedicates Dolon's spoils to Pallas and marks the spot. They then proceed to the Thracian camp. Diomed slaughters Rhesus and twelve other Thracian warriors in their sleep. Ulysses unties Rhesus's famous white horses. Pallas appears and warns them that Apollo is about to rouse the Trojans, urging them to return. They ride Rhesus's horses back to the Greek camp.

Nestor, hearing the approaching horses, is the first to recognize their return. Diomed and Ulysses are greeted triumphantly by the other chiefs and recount their successful raid. Rhesus's horses are taken to Diomed's stalls, and Dolon's armor is dedicated to Pallas. The heroes cleanse themselves and feast, pouring libations to Pallas.

**Book XI: The Third Battle, and the Acts of Agamemnon.**
As dawn breaks, Eris (Discord), sent by Jupiter, descends to the Greek fleet, inspiring the warriors with fierce resolve. Agamemnon arms himself in splendid, divinely crafted armor and leads the Greeks into battle. Juno and Minerva support the Greeks with thunder. Jupiter sends down drops of blood, foreshadowing the day's slaughter.

The Trojans, led by Hector, Polydamas, Æneas, and others, array themselves near Ilus' tomb. Hector, shining in his armor, moves through the ranks. The battle begins with intense fighting on both sides, neither yielding. Agamemnon leads the charge, killing Bienor and his squire Oïleus. He then kills two sons of Priam, Isus and Antiphus, and two sons of Antimachus, Pisander and Hippolochus, refusing their pleas for ransom. Agamemnon's fury drives the Trojans back towards the city walls.

Jupiter, seeing Agamemnon's success, sends Iris to Hector. Iris delivers Jupiter's command: Hector must withdraw from the front while Agamemnon rages, but when Agamemnon is wounded and retreats, Hector will be granted strength and victory until sunset. Hector obeys, withdrawing his main force.

Coön, Antenor's eldest son, wounds Agamemnon in the arm. Agamemnon kills Coön but is overcome by agonizing pain from his wound. He mounts his chariot and retreats to the ships. Hector, seeing Agamemnon's withdrawal, charges the Greeks with renewed fury, killing many heroes.

Ulysses and Diomed make a stand, rallying the Greeks. Diomed kills Thymbraeus and Molion. Hector confronts Diomed, who throws a spear that grazes Hector's helmet. Hector is stunned but recovers. Paris then shoots an arrow from a distance, piercing Diomed's foot. Paris boasts, but Diomed insults him as a cowardly archer and is carried to his chariot by Ulysses.

Ulysses is left alone and surrounded by Trojans. He fights bravely, killing several enemies, but is eventually wounded by Socus. Ulysses calls for aid, and Menelaus and Ajax rush to his rescue, driving off the Trojans and carrying Ulysses to his chariot. Ajax continues to fight fiercely, killing Doryclus, Pandocus, and Lysander.

Hector continues his rampage on the left wing. Paris wounds Machaon, the physician, with an arrow in the shoulder. Idomeneus urges Nestor to take Machaon to the ships, as a physician is invaluable. Nestor does so.

Hector, seeing the Greek distress, drives them back to their ships. Ajax, overwhelmed by the Trojan assault, is forced to retreat. Eurypylus is wounded by Paris while defending the Greeks. Achilles, observing the battle from his ship, sees Nestor's chariot carrying a wounded man and sends Patroclus to inquire who it is.

Patroclus goes to Nestor's tent. Nestor recounts the day's heavy losses, with many chiefs wounded, and laments Achilles' inaction. He then tells a long story of his own youthful valor and reminds Patroclus of the advice given to him and Achilles by their fathers. Nestor urges Patroclus to persuade Achilles to fight, or at least to lead the Myrmidons into battle clad in Achilles' armor, to frighten the Trojans and save the fleet. On his way back, Patroclus encounters the wounded Eurypylus, takes him to his tent, removes the arrow, and applies healing balms.

**Book XII: The Battle at the Grecian Wall.**
While Patroclus tends to Eurypylus, the battle rages at the Greek fortifications. The narrator foretells that the Greek wall, built without divine offerings, will eventually be destroyed by Neptune and Apollo after Troy's fall.

Hector leads the Trojans to the Greek trench, but their chariots cannot cross the deep, spiked ditch. Polydamas advises Hector to dismount and attack the wall on foot, dividing the army into five battalions. Hector agrees. The Trojans dismount and form their battalions, with Hector, Polydamas, and Cebriones leading the first.

Asius, however, disobeys Polydamas's counsel and attempts to drive his chariot through one of the gates, but he is repelled by two Lapith chiefs, Polypoetes and Leonteus, who bravely defend the entrance. Asius complains about the unexpected Greek resistance.

An ominous sign appears: an eagle carrying a bleeding serpent drops it among the Trojans. Polydamas interprets this as a warning that they will breach the wall but fail to take the ships, suffering heavy losses. He advises retreat. Hector furiously rejects this, asserting his trust in Jupiter's previous signs of victory and threatening Polydamas for his cowardice.

Hector then leads a fierce assault on the wall, aided by a whirlwind from Jupiter. The Trojans undermine the wall and tear down the piles supporting it. Sarpedon, Jupiter's son and a Lycian leader, delivers a stirring speech to Glaucus, urging them to fight for glory. Sarpedon then attacks the wall and, with Glaucus, makes the first breach. Ajax kills Epicles, a friend of Sarpedon, with a stone. Teucer wounds Glaucus with an arrow, forcing him to retreat. Sarpedon, despite Glaucus's injury, continues to fight, killing Alcmaon and widening the breach.

Finally, Hector, empowered by Jupiter, lifts a massive stone and smashes it through one of the main gates, breaking the bars. He then rushes through the breach, shining like a god, and leads the Trojans pouring into the Greek camp. The Greeks, terrified, flee towards their ships.

**Book XIII: The Fourth Battle Continued, in which Neptune Assists the Greeks: The Acts of Idomeneus.**
Jupiter, having seen Hector breach the Greek wall, turns his attention away from the battle, leaving the outcome to fate. Neptune, the god of the sea, observes the Greek distress from Samothracia. Incensed at Jupiter's partiality, he emerges from the deep and, disguised as the seer Calchas, inspires the Ajaces to resist Hector. He then encourages other retreating Greeks, instilling new courage in them.

The Ajaces form a strong phalanx, halting Hector's advance. Meriones, having broken his spear, goes to Idomeneus's tent for a new one. Idomeneus, the Cretan king, also eager to fight, arms himself and returns to battle with Meriones. Idomeneus displays great valor, killing Othryoneus, Asius (who had tried to force the gate in his chariot), and Alcathous.

Deiphobus, enraged by Alcathous's death, confronts Idomeneus and calls Æneas to his aid. Æneas, who had been sulking due to Priam's perceived slights, joins the fight. A fierce battle erupts around Alcathous's body. Idomeneus kills Oenomaus. Deiphobus wounds Ascalaphus, son of Mars. Meriones wounds Deiphobus, who is then carried off by Polites. Æneas kills Aphareus, and Antilochus kills Thoon. Meriones wounds Adamas, son of Asius. Helenus wounds Deipyrus.

Menelaus wounds Helenus with an arrow and then kills Pisander, who attacked him. Meriones kills Harpalion. Paris kills Euchenor. Hector remains at the central breach, fighting against various Greek contingents. The Locrian archers, fighting from the rear, rain arrows and stones upon the Trojans.

Polydamas, seeing the heavy losses and the continued danger, again advises Hector to call a council and consider retreating, fearing Achilles' eventual return. Hector agrees to the council but first goes to rally the Trojans, rebuking Paris for his absence. Hector returns to the central battle and confronts Ajax. They exchange boasts, and the battle continues fiercely as night approaches.

**Book XIV: Juno Deceives Jupiter by the Girdle of Venus.**
Nestor, sitting with the wounded Machaon, hears the intensifying sounds of battle and, leaving Machaon to be cared for, goes to investigate. He encounters Agamemnon, Diomed, and Ulysses, all wounded and retreating from the front lines. Agamemnon, in despair, proposes abandoning the siege and fleeing by night. Ulysses vehemently rebukes him for his cowardly suggestion, reminding him of their duty and the shame it would bring. Diomed advises the wounded chiefs to return to the front to encourage the troops with their presence, but to remain out of direct combat. They agree and proceed to the battle lines. Neptune, disguised as an old warrior, encourages Agamemnon, promising victory.

Meanwhile, Juno, observing Jupiter on Mount Ida aiding the Trojans, devises a plan to distract him. She meticulously adorns herself with ambrosial oils, a radiant mantle, and dazzling jewelry. She then goes to Venus and, under the false pretense of wanting to reconcile Ocean and Tethys, obtains Venus's magic girdle, which contains all charms of love, desire, and persuasion.

Next, Juno seeks out Sleep. Sleep is initially reluctant, recalling a past instance where Jupiter punished him for putting him to sleep to aid Hercules. Juno promises him Pasithaë, one of the Graces, as his wife, and swears a solemn oath by the river Styx and the Titans to ensure her promise. Sleep agrees and hides in a fir tree on Mount Ida, disguised as a bird.

Juno then approaches Jupiter on Ida. Jupiter is immediately captivated by her beauty and, despite her feigned reluctance, embraces her. Golden clouds envelop them, concealing them from view. Overcome by love and the influence of Sleep, Jupiter falls into a deep slumber.

Sleep immediately informs Neptune that Jupiter is asleep. Neptune, emboldened, rushes to aid the Greeks, rallying them and urging them to fight fiercely. Hector throws his spear at Ajax, but it is deflected. Ajax then hurls a massive stone, striking Hector in the chest and knocking him unconscious. Polydamas, Agenor, and Æneas carry the unconscious Hector from the field to the Xanthus river, where he slowly regains consciousness. With Hector removed, the Greeks press their advantage, and the battle turns in their favor. Ajax the Lesser particularly distinguishes himself in the ensuing slaughter.

**Book XV: The Fifth Battle at the Ships; and the Acts of Ajax.**
Jupiter awakens on Mount Ida and immediately perceives the deception: the Trojans are fleeing, Hector is wounded, and Neptune is aiding the Greeks. Enraged, he confronts Juno, reminding her of past punishments for her interference and threatening her with further wrath. Juno, trembling, denies her involvement, blaming Neptune's independent will and swearing by Styx and the Titans.

Jupiter accepts her oath and commands her to send Iris and Apollo to him. Iris is to order Neptune to withdraw from the battle, and Apollo is to restore Hector's strength and lead the Trojans back to the fight. Jupiter then reiterates his prophecy: Hector will drive the Greeks to their ships, Patroclus will fight in Achilles' armor, Patroclus will kill Sarpedon, Hector will kill Patroclus, and then Achilles will kill Hector, leading to Troy's eventual fall.

Juno flies to Olympus and informs the other gods of Jupiter's threats. Mars, enraged by the death of his son Ascalaphus, prepares to defy Jupiter, but Minerva restrains him. Iris and Apollo then go to Jupiter on Ida. Iris delivers Jupiter's command to Neptune, ordering him to withdraw from the battle. Neptune initially expresses defiance, asserting his equal birthright as a son of Saturn, but eventually yields, though resentfully, and plunges into the sea.

Apollo goes to Hector, heals him, and fills him with renewed strength. Hector, restored and invigorated, returns to battle, inspiring the Trojans and terrifying the Greeks. Apollo leads the Trojans, carrying Jupiter's aegis, which strikes terror into the Greeks and turns the tide of battle once more. Apollo then pushes down a large section of the Greek wall and fills the trench, creating a clear path for the Trojans to reach the ships.

The Trojans rush towards the Greek ships, intending to burn them. Patroclus, still tending to Eurypylus, sees the ships in danger and rushes back to Achilles to urge him to fight. Hector attacks the ship of Protesilaus. Clytius attempts to set it on fire but is killed by Ajax. Ajax fiercely defends the ships, killing Lycophron. Teucer joins him, but when he aims at Hector, Jupiter breaks his bowstring. Ajax tells Teucer to use a spear instead. Hector boasts of Jupiter's favor and urges the Trojans to burn the ships. Ajax rallies the Greeks, reminding them that their only hope is to fight or die defending the ships. The battle rages intensely around the ships, with Hector seizing one vessel. Ajax, overwhelmed by the continuous assault, is forced to retreat, though he kills twelve Trojans who try to set the ships on fire.

**Book XVI: The Sixth Battle, the Acts and Death of Patroclus.**
As the battle rages and the Greek ships begin to burn, Patroclus, weeping, approaches Achilles' tent. He pleads with Achilles to return to battle or, at least, to allow him to lead the Myrmidons into battle clad in Achilles' armor, to frighten the Trojans and save the fleet.

Achilles, moved by Patroclus's tears and the sight of the burning ships, agrees to his request. However, he gives Patroclus strict instructions: he must only repel the Trojans from the ships and not pursue them to Troy's walls, lest a god intervene and cause his death. Achilles expresses a wish that all Greeks and Trojans might die, leaving only himself and Patroclus to sack Troy.

Patroclus arms himself in Achilles' splendid armor (except for Achilles' spear, which only Achilles can wield). Automedon harnesses Achilles' immortal horses, Xanthus and Balius, along with the mortal Pedasus. Achilles then offers a libation to Jupiter, praying for Patroclus's success and safe return. Jupiter grants the first part of the prayer (success in repelling the Trojans) but denies the latter (Patroclus's safe return).

Patroclus leads the Myrmidons into battle. The Trojans, seeing Achilles' armor, are struck with panic, believing Achilles has returned. Patroclus kills Pyrechmes and drives the Trojans from the ships, extinguishing the fires. He then goes on a rampage, killing numerous Trojan heroes, including Areilycus, Thoas, Amphidus, Atymnius, Maris, Cleobulus, Lycon, Neamas, and Erymas. Hector is forced to retreat, and the Trojans are driven back towards the trench.

Sarpedon, Jupiter's son and a Lycian leader, rallies his forces and confronts Patroclus. Jupiter debates whether to save his son but is persuaded by Juno to let fate take its course. Jupiter weeps tears of blood, and Patroclus kills Sarpedon with a spear to the chest. A fierce battle erupts over Sarpedon's body. Glaucus, though wounded, prays to Apollo for strength, which is granted, and he rallies the Lycians and Trojans. Hector joins the fight for Sarpedon's body. The Greeks eventually manage to strip Sarpedon's armor. Jupiter commands Apollo to take Sarpedon's body, cleanse it, anoint it, and send it to Lycia via Sleep and Death for proper burial.

Patroclus, ignoring Achilles' strict command, pursues the fleeing Trojans to the walls of Troy. He attempts to scale the walls three times but is repelled by Apollo. Apollo, disguised as Asius, warns Hector to attack Patroclus, promising divine aid. Hector drives his chariot towards Patroclus. Patroclus throws a stone, killing Cebriones, Hector's charioteer. A battle ensues over Cebriones' body.

Apollo, shrouded in a cloud, strikes Patroclus from behind, disarming him by breaking his spear, shield strap, and helmet. Euphorbus, a Dardan youth, then wounds Patroclus with a spear but retreats. Hector then delivers the fatal blow with his spear. As he dies, Patroclus prophesies Hector's imminent death by Achilles' hand. Hector boasts over Patroclus's body and strips Achilles' armor from him. Automedon drives Achilles' horses away from the battle.

**Book XVII: The Seventh Battle, for the Body of Patroclus.—The Acts of Menelaus.**
Upon Patroclus's death, Menelaus immediately rushes to defend his body from the Trojans. Euphorbus, who had wounded Patroclus, challenges Menelaus and is killed by him. Menelaus begins to strip Euphorbus's armor. Apollo, disguised as Mentes, warns Hector that Menelaus has killed Euphorbus and is about to strip Patroclus's body of Achilles' armor.

Hector, hearing this, rushes back to the scene. Menelaus, seeing Hector approaching in Achilles' armor (which Hector had already taken from Patroclus), reluctantly retreats. Hector then seizes Patroclus's body, intending to drag it away. Menelaus calls for Ajax Telamon, who quickly arrives. Together, Ajax and Menelaus stand over Patroclus's body, defending it.

Glaucus, the Lycian leader, rebukes Hector for abandoning Sarpedon's body and for his perceived cowardice against Ajax. He urges Hector to fight fiercely for Patroclus's body, suggesting it could be exchanged for Sarpedon's. Stung by the rebuke, Hector puts on Achilles' armor (which he had taken from Patroclus) and rallies his troops, promising rich rewards to anyone who can drag Patroclus's body to Troy.

Jupiter, seeing Hector in Achilles' divine armor, pities him and grants him a moment of glory before his fated death. A fierce battle erupts over Patroclus's body. Automedon, Achilles' charioteer, is distressed. Alcimedon takes the reins of Achilles' immortal horses, and they attempt to defend the chariot from Æneas and Hector, who try to capture it. Automedon fights bravely, killing Aretus.

Minerva, sent by Jupiter, encourages Menelaus. Apollo, disguised as Phaenops, encourages Hector. Jupiter shakes his aegis, terrifying the Greeks. Idomeneus and Meriones are forced to retreat. Ajax, seeing the battle shrouded in darkness, prays to Jupiter to dispel the mist, even if it means their death. Jupiter grants his prayer, restoring light to the field.

Ajax then tells Menelaus to send Antilochus to Achilles with the news of Patroclus's death. Antilochus, weeping, runs to Achilles. Menelaus and Meriones, with the Ajaces defending them, bear Patroclus's body from the field towards the ships, facing continuous and furious Trojan resistance. The battle continues to rage around the retreating Greeks.

**Book XVIII: The Grief of Achilles, and New Armour Made Him by Vulcan.**
The battle continues fiercely. Antilochus, Nestor's son, brings the devastating news of Patroclus's death to Achilles. Achilles is overwhelmed with grief, casting dust over his head, tearing his hair, and rolling on the ground in agony. His captive women also lament.

Thetis, Achilles' mother, hears his cries from the depths of the sea and rises with her Nereid sisters to comfort him. Achilles tells his mother that he no longer wishes to live unless he can avenge Patroclus by killing Hector. He accepts his own fated death, which he knows will follow Hector's. Thetis, weeping, reminds him that he cannot fight without armor, as Hector has taken his. She promises to go to Vulcan to obtain new, divinely forged armor for him by dawn.

While Thetis departs for Olympus, the battle for Patroclus's body continues to rage. Hector is still attempting to drag the body away. Juno, seeing the Greeks in dire straits, secretly sends Iris to Achilles, ordering him to show himself at the trench to frighten the Trojans, even without armor. Achilles, inspired by Pallas, appears at the trench, shrouded in a golden cloud, with a flaming aura around his head. His loud shouts and terrifying appearance strike panic into the Trojans. Twelve Trojans are crushed in the ensuing chaos. The Greeks seize the opportunity to retrieve Patroclus's body and carry it to Achilles' tent.

As night falls, the sun sets, and the battle ends. The Trojans hold a council. Polydamas advises retreating into the city walls, fearing Achilles' return. Hector, however, rejects this counsel, insisting they remain on the plain to confront Achilles at dawn, believing he can defeat him. Pallas influences the Trojans to approve Hector's ill-fated advice.

Achilles continues to mourn Patroclus, vowing to avenge him and to sacrifice twelve Trojan youths on his pyre. He orders Patroclus's body to be washed and anointed.

Thetis arrives at Vulcan's palace on Olympus. Vulcan, grateful to Thetis for having saved him in the past, readily agrees to forge new armor for Achilles. He crafts a magnificent shield, depicting the cosmos, two cities (one at peace, one at war), agricultural scenes (ploughing, harvest, vineyard), a herd of oxen attacked by lions, a sheepfold, and a dancing ground, all encircled by the river Oceanus. He also forges a splendid cuirass, greaves, and a helmet. Thetis takes the blazing new armor and flies back to Achilles.

**Book XIX: The Reconciliation of Achilles and Agamemnon.**
At dawn, Thetis brings the magnificent, divinely forged armor to Achilles, finding him still mourning Patroclus. Achilles is awestruck by the armor but expresses concern about Patroclus's body decaying. Thetis reassures him, pouring nectar and ambrosia into Patroclus's nostrils to preserve the body from decay. She then instructs Achilles to assemble the Greeks and publicly renounce his wrath against Agamemnon.

Achilles obeys, calling the Greeks to an assembly. He declares his anger is over and he is ready to fight. Agamemnon, still wounded, rises and explains his past actions by blaming Ate (Delusion), recounting how even Jupiter was once deluded. He then formally offers all the gifts he had promised to Achilles. Achilles accepts the gifts but expresses his impatience to fight, his soul consumed by vengeance for Patroclus.

Ulysses intervenes, advising that the army must first eat and rest to regain strength for the arduous battle ahead. He also insists that Agamemnon publicly present the gifts and swear a solemn oath that he never touched Briseïs. Agamemnon agrees to all conditions. Ulysses, Nestor's sons, and other chiefs deliver the gifts to Achilles' tent. Agamemnon then takes the oath before the assembled Greeks, sacrificing a boar and swearing by Jupiter and the Furies that Briseïs was returned untouched. The sacrificed boar is thrown into the sea.

Achilles still refuses to eat, his grief for Patroclus overwhelming him. Briseïs, returned to his tent, sees Patroclus's body and laments him, recalling his kindness and his promises of marriage. Achilles continues to mourn, expressing his sorrow and his wish that Patroclus had lived to raise his son. Jupiter, seeing Achilles' refusal to eat, sends Minerva to infuse nectar and ambrosia into him, strengthening him for battle.

Achilles then dons his new, blazing armor, which shines like fire. He takes up his great spear, which only he can wield. Automedon and Alcimus prepare his immortal horses. Achilles addresses his horses, Xanthus and Balius, reproaching them for leaving Patroclus to die. Xanthus, miraculously given voice by Juno, tells Achilles that he will be safe this day, but his own death is near, fated by a god and a mortal. Achilles, undaunted by the prophecy, declares he knows his fate and rushes to battle, eager for vengeance.

**Book XX: The Battle of the Gods, and the Acts of Achilles.**
As Achilles prepares to re-enter battle, Jupiter convenes a council of the gods on Olympus. He grants permission for all deities to assist either the Greeks or the Trojans, fearing that Achilles, if left unchecked, might prematurely sack Troy against fate. The gods descend to the plain, their presence causing immense tumult and shaking the earth and Olympus, even disturbing Hades.

The gods take sides: Juno, Neptune, Minerva, Hermes, and Vulcan support the Greeks; Latona, Apollo, Mars, Diana, and Xanthus (the river god Scamander) support the Trojans. The divine forces prepare to clash.

Achilles, filled with boundless rage, seeks Hector. Apollo, disguised as Lycaon, encourages Æneas to confront Achilles. Æneas is initially hesitant, recalling past defeats by Achilles. They exchange boasts about their divine and heroic lineages. Æneas throws his spear, which strikes Achilles' divine shield but is repelled. Achilles throws his spear, which pierces Æneas's shield and grazes his back.

Neptune, seeing Æneas in peril and remembering Jupiter's will that Æneas is destined to survive and found a new line, intervenes. He shrouds Achilles' eyes in darkness, removes the spear from Æneas's shield, and carries Æneas away to the rear of the battle, warning him to avoid Achilles until Achilles' fated death.

Achilles, realizing a god intervened, resumes his rampage against the other Trojans. He kills Iphytion, Demoleon, Hippodamas, and Polydore (Priam's youngest son). Hector, enraged by Polydore's death, confronts Achilles, despite Apollo's warning to avoid single combat. Achilles throws his spear at Hector, but Pallas deflects it back to Achilles. Hector throws his spear, but Apollo shrouds him in a cloud, saving him from Achilles' wrath. Achilles, frustrated, vows to kill Hector later and continues his slaughter of other Trojans, including Dryops, Demuchus, Laoganus, Dardanus, Alastor, Mulius, Echeclus, Deucalion, Rhigmas, and his charioteer. The battlefield is deluged with blood and bodies as Achilles' chariot tramples the slain.

**Book XXI: The Battle in the River Scamander.**
The Trojans flee before Achilles, some towards the city, others plunging into the Scamander river. Juno creates a mist to aid those fleeing to the city. Achilles, abandoning his spear, plunges into the river with his sword, slaughtering Trojans and taking twelve captives alive for sacrifice to Patroclus.

He encounters Lycaon, a son of Priam whom he had previously captured and sold into slavery. Lycaon begs for his life, reminding Achilles of their past encounter and his royal lineage. Achilles, hardened by Patroclus's death, refuses mercy and brutally kills Lycaon, throwing his body into the river, insulting him and wishing all Trojans would perish similarly.

Achilles then confronts Asteropeus, a Paeonian leader and son of the river Axius. Asteropeus wounds Achilles' hand, but Achilles kills him, boasting of his superior divine lineage. He throws Asteropeus's body into the river.

The Scamander river, angered by the dead bodies choking its stream, rises in human form and commands Achilles to cease his slaughter. Achilles refuses, vowing to continue until Troy is sacked and Hector is dead. The river then unleashes a massive flood, sweeping away bodies and attacking Achilles. Achilles struggles against the torrent, clinging to an elm tree, which is uprooted. He is swept away.

Neptune and Pallas appear in human form, encouraging Achilles and promising divine aid against the river. They tell him to continue fighting until Hector is slain. Scamander calls upon his brother river, Simois, to help overwhelm Achilles. Juno, seeing Achilles in danger, calls upon Vulcan to unleash his fires against the rivers. Vulcan's flames consume the dead, dry the land, and cause the rivers to boil in agony. Scamander begs Juno to stop, promising to cease aiding Troy. Juno orders Vulcan to withdraw his flames.

With the river battle ended, the other gods engage in combat: Pallas strikes Mars with a stone, knocking him down. Venus rescues Mars, but Pallas strikes her too. Neptune challenges Apollo, but Apollo refuses to fight for mortals. Diana rebukes Apollo for his cowardice, but Juno attacks Diana, seizing her bow and quiver and striking her. Hermes refuses to fight Latona. The gods return to Olympus.

Apollo, still concerned for Troy, trembles for its walls as Achilles continues his slaughter. Priam orders the city gates opened for the fleeing Trojans. Apollo, disguised as Agenor, confronts Achilles. Achilles pursues the disguised Apollo, allowing the remaining Trojans to retreat safely into the city. The Trojans close their gates, safe from Achilles, while he is still deluded by Apollo.

**Book XXII: The Death of Hector.**
The Trojans, smitten with panic, rush back into the city walls. Only Hector remains outside the Scaean Gate, resolved to face Achilles alone. Apollo, revealing himself, tells Achilles he has been deluded, allowing the Trojans to escape. Achilles expresses anger at Apollo for hindering his pursuit.

From the city walls, Priam and Hecuba see Achilles approaching, blazing in his new armor. They desperately plead with Hector to come inside, fearing his imminent death. Hecuba bares her breast, reminding him of her maternal care. Hector, however, is torn by shame and duty. He debates whether to retreat, parley with Achilles, or fight. He rejects retreat due to the shame of Polydamas's earlier, rejected advice, and dismisses parley as futile. He resolves to fight.

As Achilles draws near, his divine armor gleaming like a star, Hector's resolve fails, and he flees in terror. Achilles pursues him three times around the walls of Troy. The gods observe the chase. Jupiter expresses pity for Hector, but Pallas (Minerva) persuades him to let fate take its course.

Pallas descends to aid Achilles. She disguises herself as Deiphobus, Hector's brother, and approaches Hector, encouraging him to make a stand and promising to fight alongside him. Hector, believing he has an ally, agrees. Hector proposes an oath to Achilles that the victor will return the loser's body for burial. Achilles furiously rejects any oaths, declaring his intent to kill Hector.

Achilles launches his spear, but Hector dodges it. Pallas, unseen by Hector, returns the spear to Achilles. Hector throws his spear, which strikes Achilles' divine shield but is repelled. Hector realizes Deiphobus is not there and that he has been deceived by a god. Accepting his fate, Hector draws his sword and charges Achilles. Achilles, knowing the weakness in Patroclus's armor (which Hector is wearing), plunges his spear into Hector's neck, killing him.

Achilles boasts over the dying Hector, refusing his plea for burial and vowing to leave his body for dogs and and vultures. Hector, with his last breath, prophesies Achilles' own death at the Scaean Gate by Paris and Apollo.

Achilles strips Hector's armor. Other Greeks gather around and stab Hector's body. Achilles then pierces Hector's ankles, binds them with thongs, and ties the body to his chariot. He drags Hector's body three times around Patroclus's tomb, then towards the ships, in full view of Priam and Hecuba on the walls. Priam and Hecuba are overcome with grief, wailing and tearing their hair. Andromache, unaware, hears the wailing, rushes to the walls, and faints at the sight of her dead husband being dragged. Recovering, she laments Hector's death and the grim future for their son, Astyanax, and Troy. She decides to burn Hector's unused robes as a final, symbolic offering.

**Book XXIII: Funeral Games in Honour of Patroclus.**
The Greeks mourn Patroclus. Achilles leads the Myrmidons in a chariot procession around Patroclus's body, lamenting. He reaffirms his vow to leave Hector's body for dogs and to sacrifice twelve Trojan captives on Patroclus's pyre. The Greeks then share a funeral feast. Achilles refuses to wash or cleanse himself until Patroclus is buried and instructs Agamemnon to prepare a large funeral pyre.

Achilles, exhausted, falls asleep on the shore. The ghost of Patroclus appears to him, asking for proper burial rites so his soul can find rest and prophesying Achilles' own impending death. He also requests that their bones be mixed in one golden urn. Achilles attempts to embrace the ghost but fails. He wakes, confirms the ghost's words, and renews his grief.

The next morning, the Greeks, led by Meriones, go to Mount Ida to cut timber for the pyre. The funeral procession takes place, with the Myrmidons in chariots, followed by foot soldiers, and then Patroclus's body on a bier. Achilles, supporting Patroclus's head, cuts off a lock of his own hair (vowed to the river Sperchius) and places it on the body.

The pyre is built, and Patroclus's body is laid upon it. Achilles sacrifices numerous sheep, oxen, four horses, and two dogs. Finally, he sacrifices twelve Trojan captives on the pyre. The pyre does not burn well, so Achilles prays to the Winds (Zephyr and Boreas). Iris, sent by Achilles, summons the Winds, who then cause the pyre to blaze fiercely all night.

At dawn, the flames subside. Achilles and the chiefs quench the embers with wine, carefully collect Patroclus's white bones, place them in a golden urn, and build a large earthen mound as a tomb.

Achilles then announces funeral games with various prizes.
1.  **Chariot Race:** Prizes include a woman and a tripod-vase (1st), a mare (2nd), a cauldron (3rd), gold talents (4th), and a double bowl (5th). Competitors are Eumelus, Diomed, Menelaus, Antilochus, and Meriones. Nestor advises his son, Antilochus, on strategy. Apollo strikes Diomed's whip, but Pallas restores it and causes Eumelus's chariot to break. Diomed wins 1st. Antilochus, using a cunning maneuver, takes 2nd from Menelaus. Menelaus takes 3rd, Meriones 4th, and Eumelus 5th. Achilles gives Eumelus a separate prize for his misfortune. Menelaus initially accuses Antilochus of foul play, but Antilochus apologizes and yields the prize, which Menelaus graciously allows him to keep. Achilles gives Nestor a special prize for his wisdom.
2.  **Boxing (Caestus) Match:** Epeüs and Euryalus compete. Epeüs, a large man, boasts of his strength and knocks Euryalus out with a single blow.
3.  **Wrestling Match:** Ajax Telamon and Ulysses compete. They grapple fiercely, but neither can throw the other. Achilles declares it a draw and awards them equal prizes.
4.  **Foot Race:** Oilean Ajax, Ulysses, and Antilochus compete. Ajax leads, then Ulysses. Pallas trips Ajax, causing him to fall in dung. Ulysses wins 1st, Antilochus 2nd, and Ajax 3rd. Ajax complains that a goddess helped Ulysses, and Antilochus makes a jest. Achilles awards Antilochus an extra gold talent.
5.  **Single Combat (Spear Fight):** Diomed and Ajax Telamon compete for Sarpedon's armor and a Thracian sword. They exchange spear thrusts. The Greeks stop the fight, declaring both worthy. Diomed is awarded the sword.
6.  **Discus Throw:** Polypoetes, Leonteus, Ajax, and Epeüs compete. Polypoetes throws a massive iron quoit the farthest and wins.
7.  **Archery Contest:** Merion and Teucer compete to shoot a dove tied to a mast. Teucer cuts the cord but misses the bird. Merion then shoots the bird as it flies away, winning the prize.
8.  **Javelin Throw:** Merion and Agamemnon compete. Achilles declares Agamemnon the best and awards him the charger, giving Merion the spear as a gift for Agamemnon's brother.

**Book XXIV: The Redemption of the Body of Hector.**
After the funeral games, the Greeks return to their ships, but Achilles remains consumed by grief for Patroclus. He continues to drag Hector's body around Patroclus's tomb daily. Apollo, pitying Hector, protects his body from mutilation and decay.

The gods are moved by compassion for Hector and his family. Apollo argues for the return of Hector's body, criticizing Achilles' excessive cruelty. Juno, still implacable towards Troy, opposes this. Jupiter, however, decrees that Hector's body must be returned. He sends Thetis to Achilles to command him to accept ransom. Thetis finds Achilles mourning and delivers Jupiter's message. Achilles, though still grieving, agrees to obey the will of the gods.

Jupiter then sends Iris to Priam, instructing the aged king to go alone to Achilles' tent with rich gifts to ransom Hector's body. He is to take only an aged herald and mules, and Hermes will guide and protect him. Despite Hecuba's desperate pleas and warnings against the danger, Priam, encouraged by Jupiter's command, resolves to go. He gathers a vast array of gifts from his treasury. He laments his lost sons and harshly rebukes his surviving sons before departing. Hecuba offers a libation to Jupiter and asks for an omen, which Jupiter provides by sending an eagle.

Priam departs with the herald Idæus, driving the car with the gifts and mules. Jupiter sends Hermes, disguised as a young Myrmidon, to guide and protect them. Hermes meets Priam and Idæus at a spring, reassures Priam, and reveals that Hector's body is still intact and preserved by the gods. Hermes puts the Greek guards to sleep, opens the gates, and leads Priam and the gifts into Achilles' tent. He then reveals his divine identity and vanishes.

Priam enters, kneels before Achilles, embraces his knees, and kisses his hands (the hands that killed his son). He appeals to Achilles' memory of his own aged father, Peleus, and begs for Hector's body, offering the ransom. Achilles is deeply moved by Priam's plea, remembering his own father and Patroclus. Both men weep in shared grief.

Achilles raises Priam and speaks of the common lot of human suffering, urging Priam to bear his grief. Priam reiterates his plea for Hector's body. Achilles, angered by Priam's persistence but mindful of Jupiter's command, agrees to return Hector's body. He orders his handmaids to wash, anoint, and wrap Hector's body in fine garments, out of Priam's sight, to prevent further outbursts of rage. As the body is placed on the car, Achilles speaks to Patroclus's shade, asking forgiveness for returning Hector, but noting it is Jupiter's will.

Achilles invites Priam to a meal, telling him the story of Niobe to encourage him to eat. They eat together, admiring each other. Priam asks for a twelve-day truce for Hector's funeral rites, which Achilles grants. Priam and Idæus sleep in the porch. Hermes awakens Priam before dawn, warning him of the danger of being discovered by the Greeks, and guides them safely out of the camp.

Priam and Idæus return to Troy at dawn. Cassandra is the first to see them from the city walls and alerts the city. The Trojans rush out to meet the wain. Andromache, Hecuba, and Helen lead the lamentations over Hector's body. Andromache mourns Hector and fears for their son Astyanax's future. Hecuba mourns Hector, noting his body's preservation by the gods. Helen mourns Hector, calling him her only kind friend in Troy.

The Trojans then gather wood for nine days. On the tenth day, Hector's body is burned on a pyre. His bones are collected in a golden urn, wrapped in purple, and buried in a tomb. Strong guards watch the tomb. Finally, the Trojans hold a funeral feast. The mighty Hector's shade rests peacefully."
The Scarlet Letter-Nathaniel Hawthorne,"The narrative begins with a detailed description of the Custom-House in Salem, Massachusetts, where the unnamed narrator works as a Surveyor. He describes the dilapidated building and his elderly, mostly inactive colleagues, including a ""patriarchal"" Inspector who is a cheerful gourmand, and the ""gallant old General"" who serves as the Collector, a respected but frail military veteran. The narrator finds his work uninspiring and believes it is stifling his literary and intellectual faculties.

A political change occurs with the election of General Taylor to the Presidency, leading to the narrator's ""decapitation"" (removal from office). This event, though initially unwelcome, frees him to return to his literary pursuits.

During his time at the Custom-House, the narrator makes a significant discovery in an unfinished upper room. Among dusty official documents, he finds a small package wrapped in old yellow parchment. Inside, he discovers a commission for one Jonathan Pue, a former Surveyor of His Majesty's Customs for Salem, dating back many years. Enclosed with this commission are private documents written by Mr. Pue, which contain a ""reasonably complete explanation of the whole affair"" concerning a woman named Hester Prynne. The narrator also finds a piece of fine red cloth, much worn and faded, with traces of gold embroidery, shaped into the capital letter ""A."" Upon placing this scarlet letter on his own breast, he experiences a sensation of burning heat.

Inspired by Mr. Pue's manuscript, which he states authenticates the main facts of the story, and urged by an imagined ghostly encounter with Mr. Pue, the narrator decides to write the tale of Hester Prynne. He acknowledges taking creative license with the characters' motives and passions but asserts the authenticity of the outline provided by the old Surveyor.

The story of ""The Scarlet Letter"" begins in Boston, ""not less than two centuries ago,"" in front of a grim, weather-stained wooden prison. A stern crowd of Puritan men and women is gathered, awaiting a public spectacle. Beside the prison door, a wild rose-bush blooms, offering a symbol of nature's pity.

From the prison emerges Hester Prynne, a tall, elegant, and beautiful young woman, carrying a three-month-old baby. On her breast, she wears an elaborately embroidered scarlet letter ""A"" made of fine red cloth with gold-thread, a striking and splendid adornment that defies the colony's sumptuary regulations. The women in the crowd discuss her punishment, some wishing for a harsher one like branding, while a younger wife expresses sympathy for Hester's inner suffering.

Hester is led to a scaffold in the market-place, a platform for public shame. Despite her inner agony, she maintains a serene demeanor. Her mind is flooded with memories of her past: her childhood home in Old England, her parents, and a pale, thin, scholar-like man with a slightly deformed shoulder, whom she had married. She recalls a new life with him in a Continental city. The reality of her present shame, the infant in her arms, and the scarlet letter on her bosom, brings her back from these recollections.

On the outskirts of the crowd, Hester spots a white man accompanied by an Indian. The white man is small, with a furrowed, intelligent face and the same slight shoulder deformity she remembered. Hester clutches her child, recognizing him. The stranger's face twists in horror, then he controls his emotion and signals Hester to remain silent. He asks a townsman about Hester Prynne, learning that she is the wife of a learned English man who sent her to Boston two years prior but has not been heard from since. The townsman explains that Hester, left to her ""misguidance,"" had a child and refuses to name the father. The magistrates, showing mercy, sentenced her to stand on the pillory for three hours and wear the scarlet letter for life, instead of death. The stranger, who identifies himself as a wanderer recently freed from Indian captivity, remarks, ""He will be known!""

Hester feels a strange sense of shelter in the public exposure, dreading a private encounter with this man. From a balcony above the scaffold, Governor Bellingham and other eminent figures, including the Reverend Mr. Wilson and the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale, observe the scene. Mr. Wilson urges Hester to confess the father's name, suggesting Mr. Dimmesdale, her pastor, should persuade her. Governor Bellingham reinforces this, placing the responsibility on Dimmesdale.

Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale, a young, pale, and emaciated clergyman with a nervous temperament, is called upon to speak. He urges Hester to confess for her soul's peace and the father's, stating it is better than hiding a guilty heart. Hester firmly refuses, saying the letter is ""too deeply branded"" and she wishes she could endure the father's agony as well as her own. A voice from the crowd demands she speak and ""give your child a father!"" Hester, recognizing the voice, turns pale but declares, ""I will not speak! ... And my child must seek a heavenly Father; she shall never know an earthly one!"" Dimmesdale, clutching his heart, murmurs, ""Wondrous strength and generosity of a woman’s heart! She will not speak!"" Mr. Wilson then preaches a sermon on sin. Hester, in a state of ""stony crust of insensibility,"" is led back to prison with her wailing infant. It is whispered that the scarlet letter casts a ""lurid gleam"" in the dark passage.

In prison, Hester's nervous excitement leads the jailer, Master Brackett, to call a physician. The physician is Roger Chillingworth, the deformed man from the crowd, who is Hester's husband. He calms the infant with a draught and then offers one to Hester, explaining it will calm her passion. Hester, fearing it contains death, hesitates. Chillingworth reveals his purpose: he wants her to live and bear her shame, touching the scarlet letter, which seems to scorch her. He blames his own folly and her weakness for their marriage and her fall. He states they wronged each other, but declares, ""the man lives who has wronged us both! Who is he?"" Hester firmly refuses to name the father. Chillingworth, with a dark smile, vows to find him, saying, ""He will be known! ... I shall read it on his heart. Yet fear not for him! ... Not the less he shall be mine!"" He then extracts a solemn oath from Hester to keep his identity as her husband a secret, warning her that if she betrays him, the man's ""fame, his position, his life, will be in my hands."" Hester swears to keep his secret. Chillingworth leaves, asking Hester if she is afraid of nightmares and hinting at his own diabolical nature.

Upon her release from prison, Hester Prynne chooses not to flee the colony despite having the freedom to do so. She establishes herself and Pearl in a remote, thatched cottage by the sea-shore. Her reason for staying is partly an irresistible ""fatality"" that binds her to the scene of her great event, and partly a secret belief that she is connected to the child's father, a union to be recognized at final judgment. She also hopes her suffering will purge her soul. Hester supports herself and Pearl through her exquisite needlework, which becomes fashionable for public ceremonies and funerals, though she is never asked to embroider a bride's veil. She lives ascetically, giving her surplus to charity, often receiving insults. She feels isolated and branded by the scarlet letter, which strangers re-brand into her soul with their curious gazes. She develops a ""new sense,"" a sympathetic knowledge of hidden sin in other hearts, making her suspect hypocrisy in seemingly pious individuals. Children, having absorbed a vague dread from their parents, taunt her. There are rumors that her scarlet letter glows with ""infernal fire"" at night.

Hester names her child Pearl, signifying her ""great price."" Pearl is a beautiful, vigorous, and graceful child, but also wild, uncontrollable, and defiant, reflecting Hester's own passionate nature during her conception. Hester dresses Pearl in magnificent crimson and gold embroidery, which makes Pearl appear as ""the scarlet letter in another form; the scarlet letter endowed with life!"" Pearl is an outcast among other children, responding to their scorn with ""puny wrath."" At home, she creates imaginary worlds, but always with a hostile, combative spirit. Pearl's first conscious awareness was the scarlet letter, and she frequently points at it, smiles strangely, and even pelts Hester with flowers, causing her mother immense pain. Pearl denies having a Heavenly Father, stating she was ""plucked... off the bush of wild roses that grew by the prison-door,"" a fantasy possibly inspired by the townspeople's rumors that she is a ""demon offspring.""

Seven years pass. Hester, concerned by rumors that Governor Bellingham and other magistrates intend to take Pearl from her, visits the Governor's mansion to deliver embroidered gloves and plead her case. Pearl, dressed in her crimson and gold attire, frightens off children who try to mock them. In the Governor's hall, Pearl looks into a polished breastplate of armor, seeing Hester's scarlet letter reflected in ""exaggerated and gigantic proportions,"" making Hester seem hidden behind it. Pearl points to this reflection with ""elfish intelligence."" Governor Bellingham and Mr. Wilson question Pearl about her Christian upbringing. Pearl defiantly says she was not made, but plucked from the rose-bush. Hester passionately defends her right to keep Pearl, declaring Pearl is her happiness and torture, and ""the scarlet letter, only capable of being loved."" She appeals to Mr. Dimmesdale, who, pale and clutching his heart, speaks in her favor, arguing that God gave Pearl to Hester as both a blessing and a retribution, to keep her mother's soul alive. The magistrates agree to let Hester keep Pearl, provided she ensures the child's religious instruction. Pearl, in an unusual display of affection, takes Dimmesdale's hand and allows him to kiss her brow before capering away. As Hester and Pearl leave, Mistress Hibbins, the Governor's sister and a reputed witch, invites Hester to a midnight meeting in the forest with the ""Black Man."" Hester refuses, saying Pearl saves her from Satan's snare. Chillingworth, who was also present, remarks on Pearl's nature and suggests a philosopher could guess the father.

Hester, realizing Chillingworth's ""terrible machinery"" is destroying Dimmesdale, resolves to reveal Chillingworth's true identity to the minister. She finds Chillingworth gathering herbs by the sea-shore. He tells her that the magistrates have considered removing her scarlet letter, and he advocated for it. Hester observes a terrifying transformation in Chillingworth: his former intellectual calm has given way to a fierce, malevolent look, with ""a glare of red light"" in his eyes, as if his soul is on fire. He has become a ""devil"" through his seven years of revenge. Chillingworth admits his pleasure in tormenting Dimmesdale, boasting that he has kept the minister alive to suffer. He confesses that Dimmesdale has always felt his ""curse"" but never knew it was his former friend. Hester, feeling responsible for Dimmesdale's ruin, cries that she hates Chillingworth and that he has done her worse wrong than she did him. She then firmly tells Chillingworth that she will reveal his true character to Dimmesdale. Chillingworth, unable to pardon, states that their fate is sealed and that the scarlet letter has already avenged him on Hester. He waves her away and returns to his herb gathering.

Pearl returns, having made a green ""A"" from eel-grass on her own bosom. She asks Hester what the scarlet letter means, stating that Hester wears it for the same reason the minister keeps his hand over his heart. Hester, startled, tries to evade the question and then, frustrated, threatens Pearl. Hester admits to Pearl that she once met the ""Black Man"" and the scarlet letter is his mark.

Hester and Dimmesdale meet in the forest. Dimmesdale, haggard and feeble, admits to having no peace, only despair, and that his public reverence brings him more misery due to his hidden sin. He longs for scorn and hatred instead of false veneration. Hester urges him to find peace, but he confesses his penitence is ""cold and dead"" and that his ""mine burns in secret!"" He craves someone to whom he can reveal himself as the ""vilest of all sinners."" Hester then reveals that Roger Chillingworth is her husband. Dimmesdale reacts with violent passion, blaming Hester for his suffering under Chillingworth's malevolent influence. Hester begs his forgiveness, and he eventually grants it, stating that Chillingworth's revenge is ""blacker than my sin."" They sit together, hand in hand, and Hester proposes they flee the colony, either deeper into the wilderness or across the sea to Europe, to escape Chillingworth and start a new life. Dimmesdale, weakened by suffering, feels unable to venture forth alone. Hester whispers, ""Thou shalt not go alone!""

With their decision made, a sense of hope and joy fills Dimmesdale. Hester, in a moment of liberation, unclasps the scarlet letter from her bosom and throws it into the withered leaves by the brook. She removes her cap, letting her hair fall, and her beauty, youth, and radiant smile return. The forest, previously gloomy, is suddenly flooded with sunshine. Hester calls Pearl, who has been playing happily with forest creatures. Pearl, however, hesitates at the brook, gazing at her mother and the minister. She points to Hester's breast, where the scarlet letter should be. Hester realizes Pearl misses the symbol. Dimmesdale urges Hester to pacify the child. Hester sadly retrieves the scarlet letter from the leaves and fastens it back onto her bosom. Her beauty and warmth immediately depart, replaced by a ""gray shadow."" Pearl then crosses the brook, embraces Hester, and kisses the scarlet letter. Pearl asks if Dimmesdale will walk hand in hand with them into town, and if he will always keep his hand over his heart. Hester says not now, but in the future. Dimmesdale tries to kiss Pearl, but she washes his kiss off in the brook. Hester and Dimmesdale then discuss their plans to escape on a ship sailing for Bristol in three days, after Dimmesdale delivers his Election Sermon.

As Dimmesdale returns to town from the forest, he feels an unaccustomed physical energy but also a profound sense of change and alienation from his familiar surroundings and acquaintances. He is assailed by strange, wicked impulses, barely resisting blasphemous thoughts towards a deacon, an argument against the soul's immortality to an old widow, and a corrupting influence towards a young maiden. He also encounters Mistress Hibbins, who hints at his secret forest visits with the ""Black Man,"" confirming his fear that he has made a bargain with evil. Upon reaching his study, Chillingworth enters, seemingly concerned for his health. Dimmesdale rejects Chillingworth's medicine, feeling invigorated. Chillingworth, now aware of Dimmesdale's plan to escape with Hester, subtly warns him. Left alone, Dimmesdale, feeling inspired, discards his old Election Sermon and writes a new, powerful one through the night.

On Election Day, Hester and Pearl are in the market-place, which is filled with people. Hester, still wearing the scarlet letter, appears outwardly calm, but Pearl is restless and excited. Pearl observes that the minister, who held their hands in the forest, now ignores them in public, always keeping his hand over his heart. The procession of magistrates and ministers begins. Dimmesdale appears with unusual energy and strength, but his look is abstracted. Hester feels a sense of his remoteness and fears their forest meeting was a delusion. Mistress Hibbins approaches Hester, again hinting at Dimmesdale's secret connection to the ""Black Man"" and suggesting his mark will be revealed. The shipmaster, who is to take Hester and Dimmesdale away, tells Pearl to inform Hester that Chillingworth has also booked passage on their ship, intending to bring Dimmesdale aboard. Hester is filled with ""utmost consternation,"" seeing Chillingworth in the distance, smiling with ""secret and fearful meaning."" As Dimmesdale delivers his eloquent Election Sermon from the meeting-house, Hester stands by the scaffold, listening to his voice, which conveys a ""deep, sad undertone of pathos.""

After the sermon, Dimmesdale, now feeble and pale, totters towards the scaffold. He calls out to Hester and Pearl to join him. Roger Chillingworth rushes forward, trying to stop him, whispering, ""Madman, hold! what is your purpose? ... I can yet save you!"" Dimmesdale defies him, crying, ""Ha, tempter! Methinks thou art too late! ... With God’s help, I shall escape thee now!"" Leaning on Hester and holding Pearl's hand, Dimmesdale ascends the scaffold. He confesses to the assembled people that he is ""the one sinner of the world!"" and that Hester's scarlet letter is but a shadow of what he bears on his own breast. With a convulsive motion, he tears away his ministerial band, revealing a ""ghastly miracle""—a ""red stigma"" on his breast. He sinks down, and Hester supports him. Chillingworth, kneeling beside him, repeatedly cries, ""Thou hast escaped me!"" Dimmesdale tells Chillingworth, ""May God forgive thee! Thou, too, hast deeply sinned!"" He asks Pearl to kiss him, which she does, breaking a ""spell."" Her tears fall on his cheek, signifying her future as a woman ""amid human joy and sorrow."" Hester asks if they will meet again in immortal life. Dimmesdale, with his dying breath, expresses doubt, saying their sin might prevent an ""everlasting and pure reunion,"" but praises God's mercy in his afflictions, including the burning torture on his breast, Chillingworth's torment, and his public death. He dies with the word ""Farewell!""

After Dimmesdale's death, there are conflicting accounts of what was seen on his breast. Most witnesses claimed to have seen a scarlet letter ""A"" imprinted in his flesh, attributing its origin to self-inflicted penance, Chillingworth's magic, or the gnawing of remorse. However, some witnesses denied any mark, suggesting Dimmesdale's death was a parable about human righteousness being ""nugatory"" before God. The narrator's primary source, Mr. Pue's manuscript, confirms the presence of the mark and offers the moral: ""Be true! Be true! Be true! Show freely to the world, if not your worst, yet some trait whereby the worst may be inferred!""

Roger Chillingworth, deprived of his object of revenge, rapidly withers away and dies within a year, bequeathing a ""very considerable amount of property"" to little Pearl. Hester and Pearl then disappear from Boston. Years later, vague reports suggest Pearl became a wealthy heiress, married, and happy in another land.

After many years, Hester Prynne returns to her old cottage in Boston, of her own free will, still wearing the scarlet letter. The letter, no longer a stigma, becomes a symbol of awe and reverence. People bring their sorrows and perplexities to her for counsel. Hester comforts them and expresses her belief that, in Heaven's own time, a ""new truth"" will be revealed to establish a surer relation between man and woman, though she recognizes she cannot be its prophetess.

After many more years, Hester dies. A new grave is dug near Dimmesdale's old, sunken one, with a space between them. One tombstone serves for both, bearing an engraved escutcheon with the motto: ""ON A FIELD, SABLE, THE LETTER A, GULES."""
Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea-Jules Verne,"In the year 1866, a mysterious and enormous object, spindle-shaped and occasionally phosphorescent, was sighted by numerous vessels across the globe, causing widespread agitation. Initially thought to be an unknown aquatic mammal due to its size, speed, and ability to project water columns, its nature became a subject of intense debate among maritime populations, governments, and scientists. Reports from ships like the *Governor Higginson*, *Columbus*, *Helvetia*, and *Shannon* consistently described its immense size (over 350 feet long) and incredible velocity, covering vast distances in short periods.

The phenomenon evolved from a scientific puzzle into a serious danger when, in March 1867, the steamer *Moravian* struck an unmarked ""shifting reef,"" damaging its keel. Weeks later, in April 1867, the *Scotia* was struck, sustaining a large, triangular hole two yards in diameter in its hull, suggesting a powerful, sharp instrument had pierced and then withdrawn itself. The ""monster"" was blamed for numerous shipwrecks, leading to public demand for its elimination.

Professor Pierre Aronnax, a French naturalist from the Museum of Natural History in Paris, found himself in New York during this period, classifying collections. He was deeply puzzled by the mystery. After rejecting hypotheses of floating islands or wrecks due to the object's rapid movement, he considered two main possibilities: a colossal marine monster or an enormous submarine vessel. He dismissed the latter as unlikely for a private individual to build in secret, and governments denied possessing such a machine. Aronnax, consulted by the *New York Herald*, published an article proposing the existence of a gigantic, electric narwhal, armed with a powerful, steel-hard tusk capable of piercing iron plates. His article gained traction, and the U.S. government prepared an expedition.

After a two-month period where the monster disappeared, a new sighting in the North Pacific prompted the commissioning of the frigate *Abraham Lincoln*, commanded by Captain Farragut. Aronnax received an invitation from the Secretary of Marine, J.B. Hobson, to join the expedition. Despite his weariness and longing for France, Aronnax accepted, seeing it as his true vocation. His devoted Flemish servant, Conseil, calmly agreed to accompany him. They boarded the *Abraham Lincoln*, a fast frigate, which departed Brooklyn amidst cheers, heading into the Atlantic and then the Pacific.

On board, Captain Farragut was resolute in his belief in the monster and his mission to destroy it, offering a $2,000 reward for its sighting. The crew shared his enthusiasm, but Ned Land, a Canadian harpooner of exceptional skill, remained skeptical. Aronnax tried to convince Ned with scientific arguments about the immense pressure at ocean depths and the necessary strength of any creature living there, but Ned only conceded that such animals, if they existed, must be strong.

After three months of fruitless searching in the Northern Pacific, marked by false alarms and growing discontent among the crew, Captain Farragut set a three-day deadline. On the night of November 5, just as the deadline was about to expire, Ned Land sighted the object. It appeared as an intense, inexplicable electric light, illuminating the sea. The *Abraham Lincoln* attempted to evade it, but the ""supernatural animal"" approached at double the frigate's speed, encircling it with luminous rings. Farragut decided to wait for daylight to attack.

Throughout the night, the object's light reappeared, accompanied by deafening sounds. At dawn on November 6, after a thick sea fog lifted, Ned Land sighted the object again. It was a long, blackish body, estimated at 250 feet, ejecting steam and water. The *Abraham Lincoln* gave chase at full steam, but the object matched its speed, even circling the frigate at 30 miles an hour. Cannon fire hit the object but slid off its hard surface. That night, Farragut decided on a stealth attack while the object was motionless. Ned Land threw his harpoon, striking a hard body. The electric light vanished, and two enormous waterspouts erupted, throwing Aronnax overboard.

Aronnax, struggling in the dark water, was rescued by Conseil, who had followed him. Conseil reported that the frigate's screw and rudder were broken by the ""monster's teeth."" Aronnax then encountered Ned Land, who had also been thrown into the sea. Ned revealed that he had found footing on the ""gigantic narwhal"" and discovered his harpoon was blunted because the ""beast is made of sheet iron."" Aronnax realized the ""monster"" was a human-made submarine.

The submarine, which Ned called the *Nautilus*, began to move. They clung to its upper part. At daybreak, a panel opened, a man appeared, and then eight masked men forcibly drew them inside. They were imprisoned in a dark, iron-walled cabin. Ned Land was furious, but Aronnax urged caution. After some time, the cabin was flooded with electric light. Two men entered, one of whom was clearly the chief. Aronnax, Ned, and Conseil tried to communicate in French, English, German, and Latin, but their captors showed no understanding. The captors then left.

A steward, who seemed mute, brought them clothes and a meal of sea-based dishes. Aronnax noticed the letter ""N"" and the motto ""MOBILIS IN MOBILI"" engraved on the dinnerware, deducing ""N"" was the commander's initial. After eating, they fell into a deep sleep, likely due to soporifics.

Aronnax awoke to stifling air, realizing the submarine had surfaced to renew its oxygen supply. Ned Land, growing impatient with hunger, attacked the steward when he finally appeared. Captain Nemo, the commander, then revealed himself, speaking perfect French and other languages. He explained he had understood them all along but wanted to observe them. He identified them and stated that they had ""troubled his existence"" by pursuing him. He declared them ""prisoners of war"" and imposed a condition: they must remain on board the *Nautilus* and passively obey if confined, to prevent them from seeing what ""ought not to be seen."" Ned Land refused to give his word not to escape. Nemo stated he was not a ""civilised man"" and lived outside human laws, free in the sea. He then offered Aronnax a tour of the *Nautilus*.

Aronnax was led through a magnificent dining-room, where Nemo explained his diet of sea products. Nemo expressed his profound love for the sea as a place of independence. He then showed Aronnax his vast library (12,000 volumes) and a splendid museum filled with art and natural history specimens, all collected by Nemo himself. He explained that electricity powered everything on the *Nautilus*—light, heat, motion, and air renewal. He detailed the *Nautilus*'s construction: a 232-foot-long, cigar-shaped, double-hulled vessel made of steel, capable of 50 miles an hour. He explained how it dived and surfaced using water reservoirs and inclined planes, and how a powerful electric reflector illuminated its path underwater. He revealed the *Nautilus* was built in secret on a desert island, its parts sourced globally under different names, and cost over £347,500. Nemo claimed to be immensely rich.

The *Nautilus* surfaced, and Nemo took astronomical bearings, fixing their position. He provided Aronnax with maps, showing they were following the Kuro-Scivo, a warm current in the Pacific. Aronnax, Ned, and Conseil then witnessed the wonders of the submarine world through the saloon's crystal panels, observing an ""aquatic army"" of fish.

Days passed with Nemo remaining largely secluded. On November 16, Nemo invited them to a ""hunting-party"" on Crespo Island. Aronnax discovered it was a desert island. Nemo explained they would use perfected Rouquayrol apparatuses for breathing underwater (9-10 hours of air) and Ruhmkorff lamps for light. Their weapons would be air-guns firing electric glass cases. Ned Land was reluctant to dive but Conseil agreed. They entered an airlock, which filled with water, and then stepped onto the seabed.

They walked on the sandy bottom, admiring the vividly colored zoophytes and marine life, illuminated by solar rays. They reached a submarine forest, where plants grew rigidly perpendicular. Aronnax fell asleep from fatigue. He awoke to a monstrous sea-spider, which Nemo dispatched. They descended deeper, using Ruhmkorff lamps in the increasing darkness. After four hours, they reached a granite wall, the ""prop of the Island of Crespo,"" marking Nemo's boundary. On their return, Nemo shot a valuable sea-otter and his companion an albatross. Aronnax and Conseil narrowly escaped two formidable sharks when Nemo hid them under seaweed.

The *Nautilus* continued its journey, with Nemo occasionally appearing to discuss oceanography. They passed the Sandwich and Marquesas Islands. On December 11, at 1,000 yards deep, they discovered a recent shipwreck, the *Florida* from Sunderland, with corpses still on its deck, including a woman holding an infant. Sharks were approaching.

On December 27, Nemo announced they were at Vanikoro, the islands where La Perouse's expedition was lost. Aronnax recounted the known history of the wreck. Nemo then revealed he knew the full story, showing Aronnax a tin-plate box containing La Perouse's instructions. He explained that La Perouse's men, after losing their ships, built a smaller boat and perished near the Solomon Islands. Nemo concluded that a ""coral tomb makes a quiet grave,"" adding, ""of sharks and men.""

The *Nautilus* sped through the Torres Straits, a dangerous passage. On January 4, 1863, it ran aground on a rock near Gilboa Island. Nemo calmly stated they would wait for the full moon's tide on January 9 to refloat. Ned Land, seeing an opportunity, asked permission to go ashore, hoping to escape. Nemo granted it. They landed on Gilboa, finding coco-trees, bread-fruit trees, and other edible plants. Ned, overjoyed, hunted a hog and kangaroos with electric balls. Ned and Conseil discussed escaping, but a stone thrown by a native interrupted them.

They were attacked by a hundred Papuan natives. They retreated to the *Nautilus*, which remained deserted on the surface. Nemo, found playing his organ, was indifferent to the savages, stating the *Nautilus* had nothing to fear. He refused to harm them. The next morning, hundreds of natives surrounded the *Nautilus*. Aronnax and Conseil fished, finding a rare ""left shell,"" which a native's stone broke. Conseil retaliated by breaking the native's amulet bracelet. The natives then attacked with arrows. Nemo calmly ordered the hatches closed. When the tide rose, Nemo ordered the hatches opened. As natives tried to board, they were repelled by an invisible electric current on the stair-rail, Ned Land also receiving a shock. The *Nautilus* then floated free and left the Straits.

The *Nautilus* traveled at immense speed through the Indian Ocean, then the Timor Sea, heading for the Indian Ocean. Aronnax noted Nemo's temperature experiments at great depths (reaching 16,000 yards). They witnessed a dazzling phosphorescent sea. Ned Land grew increasingly frustrated by his imprisonment. On March 14, they encountered a troop of whales. Ned wanted to hunt, but Nemo refused, calling it ""killing for killing's sake."" However, when a troop of cruel cachalots appeared, preparing to attack the whales, Nemo used the *Nautilus* as a ""formidable harpoon,"" ramming and destroying many cachalots in a bloody massacre. Ned was disgusted, calling it ""butchery."" Nemo then extracted milk from a dead whale, which served as a food reserve. Ned's ill-will towards Nemo intensified.

The *Nautilus* continued south, entering the Antarctic polar circle. They navigated through immense icebergs and ice-fields. On March 18, the *Nautilus* became completely blocked by a massive, immovable ice barrier. Aronnax feared they were trapped, but Nemo announced his intention to reach the South Pole by going *under* the ice. He explained the *Nautilus*'s ability to withstand pressure and use its air reserves. After preparations, the *Nautilus* descended, navigating beneath the iceberg. On March 19, after several attempts to break through the ice ceiling, Nemo announced, ""The sea is open!""

They emerged into an open polar sea. They sighted a solitary island and a vast landmass, possibly a continent. On March 21, Captain Nemo, Aronnax, and Conseil landed. Ned Land refused to join. Nemo, with profound emotion, claimed possession of the South Pole in his own name, unfurling a black banner with a golden ""N."" They observed the volcanic landscape, meagre flora, and abundant fauna (penguins, albatrosses, seals, morses). Despite the fog, Nemo used his chronometer to confirm their exact position at the South Pole.

The next day, March 22, as they prepared to leave, a violent shock occurred. An enormous iceberg overturned and struck the *Nautilus*, trapping it on its side at over 180 fathoms deep. Nemo explained they were imprisoned in a tunnel of ice. The *Nautilus* righted itself but remained trapped, with ice walls above and below. Ned Land feared they were doomed. They began digging a trench through the ice, but progress was slow, and their air supply was limited to two days. Aronnax also noticed the ice walls were closing in, threatening to crush the vessel. Nemo decided to inject boiling water to prevent further freezing. The temperature slowly rose.

On March 27, with only two yards of ice remaining, the air in the *Nautilus* became dangerously depleted, causing suffocation. Ned and Conseil selflessly shared their remaining air with Aronnax. On March 28, Nemo made a final desperate attempt: he lightened the vessel, positioned it over the trench, then filled the reservoirs to increase its weight to 1,800 tons, using its mass to crush the remaining ice. The ice cracked, and the *Nautilus* plunged downwards, then rapidly ascended, breaking through the last layer of ice. The panel opened, and fresh air flooded the vessel.

Aronnax, Ned, and Conseil, revived by the pure air, were on the platform. The *Nautilus* sped northward, passing Cape Horn and Terra del Fuego. They skirted the coasts of Patagonia and Brazil, then entered a deep submarine valley between Cape San Roque and Sierra Leone. The *Nautilus* surfaced at the mouth of the Amazon River. They observed diverse marine life, including an incident where Conseil was shocked by an electric cramp-fish. Aronnax explained the ecological importance of manatees, which were being decimated.

On April 16, they sighted Martinique and Guadaloupe. Ned Land, frustrated by the lack of escape opportunities, became increasingly desperate. Aronnax noted Nemo's growing seclusion and changed demeanor since the poulp fight. Aronnax confronted Nemo about their imprisonment. Nemo showed him a manuscript detailing his life and studies, which he intended to cast into the sea in a floating case, as he would never release them. He reiterated his rule: ""Whoever enters the *Nautilus*, must never quit it."" Aronnax relayed this to his companions, and Ned resolved to escape at the next opportunity.

A hurricane struck off Long Island. Nemo, by an ""unaccountable caprice,"" braved the storm on the surface, lashed to the platform. The *Nautilus* proved its invulnerability. After the storm, the *Nautilus* wandered eastward, then southward, passing the Newfoundland Bank and the transatlantic cable. On June 1, the *Nautilus* stopped at 420 fathoms. Nemo revealed they were at the wreck of the French warship *Avenger*, which had sunk heroically on that very spot on June 1, 1794, rather than surrender. Aronnax realized Nemo's profound, personal hatred was driving his actions.

A warship was sighted approaching. It fired upon the *Nautilus*. Nemo, enraged, unfurled a black flag with a golden ""N"" and ordered Aronnax and his companions below, declaring he would sink the ship as an act of vengeance. He revealed he had lost ""country, wife, children, father, and mother"" through the ""oppressor"" (the nation of the warship). Aronnax, Ned, and Conseil resolved to escape during the attack. The *Nautilus* submerged and, accelerating, rammed the warship below its waterline, passing through it like a needle. Aronnax, a horrified witness, watched through the saloon window as the ship sank rapidly, its crew drowning. After the ""hecatomb,"" Nemo retreated to his room, where Aronnax saw him kneel before a portrait of a woman and two children, bursting into sobs.

The *Nautilus* sped northward at immense speed, leaving the scene of destruction. Aronnax felt horror for Nemo. Time became distorted, clocks stopped. Ned Land, at the end of his patience, told Aronnax they would fly that night, having found land 20 miles east. Aronnax agreed. At 10 PM, Aronnax crept to the saloon, where he found Nemo playing his organ. As Aronnax prepared to open the library door, Nemo rose and murmured, ""Almighty God! enough! enough!"" Aronnax rushed to the boat, where Ned and Conseil were waiting. Ned closed the *Nautilus*'s opening and began loosening the bolts.

Suddenly, cries of ""The maelstrom! the maelstrom!"" were heard. They realized the *Nautilus* was being drawn into the Maelstrom, a powerful whirlpool off the coast of Norway. The boat, still fastened to the *Nautilus*, was carried along at dizzying speed. A crashing noise, the bolts gave way, and the boat was hurled into the whirlpool. Aronnax struck his head and lost consciousness.

Aronnax awoke in a fisherman's hut on the Loffoden Isles, with Ned Land and Conseil safe. He could not recall how they escaped the Maelstrom. He revised his account of the incredible expedition, which had covered 20,000 leagues in less than ten months. He wondered about the fate of the *Nautilus* and Captain Nemo, hoping that the vessel survived and that Nemo's hatred had been appeased, allowing him to continue his peaceful exploration of the sea."

**Chapter 9: Scylla and Charybdis**
Stephen Dedalus is at the National Library, discussing Shakespeare's *Hamlet* with John Eglinton, A.E. (Russell), Mr. Best, and Mr. Lyster. Stephen presents his theory that Shakespeare is the ghost of Hamlet's father, and that the play reflects Shakespeare's personal life, including the death of his son Hamnet and his marriage to Anne Hathaway.

Stephen argues that Shakespeare's genius is revealed through his ""errors"" and that his art is deeply personal. He connects Shakespeare's financial dealings to Shylock and the theme of the ""usurping brother"" to his own family. Mulligan enters, having received a telegram from Stephen, and mocks Stephen's intellectual pursuits.

Mulligan identifies Bloom, who has entered the library, as ""Jehovah, collector of prepuces,"" and teases Stephen about Bloom knowing his father.

He reflects on Molly's lovers, including Boylan, experiencing envy, jealousy, abnegation, and equanimity. He kisses Molly's rump. He then gives a modified narration of his day to Molly, omitting certain details. Stephen Dedalus emerges as the salient point of his narration. Limitations of activity and conjugal rights are perceived. They lie in bed, Molly ""fulfilled, recumbent, big with seed,"" and Bloom ""the childman weary, the manchild in the womb.""
