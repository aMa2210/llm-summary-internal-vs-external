Nora Helmer, the wife of Torvald Helmer, returns from Christmas shopping, joyfully carrying packages. Her husband, Torvald, a lawyer who is soon to become the manager of the bank, greets her with affectionate but condescending pet names like \"\"my little skylark\"\" and \"\"my little squirrel.\"\" He chides her playfully for spending too much money, despite their improved financial prospects. Nora reveals she has saved some money and implies she has been working secretly, but dismisses it as unimportant.\n",
